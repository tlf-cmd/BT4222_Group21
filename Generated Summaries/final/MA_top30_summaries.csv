The RCP 8.5 scenario was selected because it represents a business-as-usual, worst-case scenario climate emissions trajectory model and provides an upper-boundary condition to support our analysis and risk-management measures.

As an example of privacy by design, our Mastercard Recovery Insights program leverages aggregated and anonymized data to create actionable insights in response to the pandemic. It acts in real time to help identify devices, detect when they are compromised and prevent fraud. Everything we do as an organization from our rigorous all-employee and contingent- worker trainings and follow-the-sun security model to our best-in-class skill-building and analysis facilities and pursuit of top talent deepens our ability to keep our organization, our people and our data secure. Our dedication to data responsibility and privacy has established Mastercard as a trusted partner around the globe. We take a principled approach to cybersecurity that guides how we secure both Mastercard and the broader global digital ecosystem.

This includes solar panels in our OFallon, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri; and Purchase, New York, locations. We launched initiatives to help us meet that goal, including formally linking executive compensation to carbon neutrality (or the 100 percent offset of our operational Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions) so our leadership teams are held accountable for these commitments. Our final approach, in countries without a renewable-energy credit market, is to purchase renewable-energy credits in neighboring countries that are connected to the same grid. The third component is buying in-country renewable- energy credits at our global sites that are too small for long-term agreements. Carbon neutrality We achieved carbon neutrality, or the 100% offset of our operational CO2 emissions, in 2021."
