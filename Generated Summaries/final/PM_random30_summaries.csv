The Business Transformation Metrics Reporting 2022 was prepared by Management of PMI based on the Business Transformation-Linked Financing Framework (or Business Transformation Framework in short) and made available under https://www.pmi.com/investor-relations/overview/ business-transformation-linked-financing-framework ). Success requires that we reposition our core business while actively investing in new areas of growth, keeping the longer-term horizon in sight, and working relentlessly to earn the trust and confidence of our stakeholders. Our assurance report will therefore have to be read in connection with the Business Transformation-Linked Financing Framework prepared by PMI, its definitions and procedures in the document Business Transformation Framework and the footnotes on pages 26, 190 to 191 and glossary (205 to 209) in the Business Transformation Metrics Reporting 2022. A tangible illustration of this can be seen in this years Business Transformation Metrics, which we have streamlined to ensure that we focus on the most meaningful KPIs measuring transformation (read more here ).

REPORTING AND PERFORMANCEPhilip Morris International Integrated Report 2022208 209 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Governance Fundamentals Reporting and performanceThis report and related materials contain projections of future results and goals and other forward-looking statements, including statements regarding business plans and strategies. We embedded the results of our companys most recent sustainability materiality assessment and priorities and considered our companys progress in evolving and transforming our business model. In the future, we will consider expanding into other areas where we see strategic opportunities. Philip Morris International Integrated Report 202228 29 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Governance Fundamentals Reporting and performance Anchoring sustainability at the core of our strategyPMIs 2025 Roadmap, first introduced in 2019, outlines our key goals and informs the route of our companys long-term plan. At PMI, research and development (R&D) is the catalyst for our business transformation. Human capital development remains core to PMI values and to our long-term success, and as such we will continue evolving our success measures to be more impact-driven. Management Our efforts to protect natural capital are overseen by our Senior Vice President, Operations, a member of our Company Management. To achieve our purpose, a radical transformation of our business is required. Although we are at the beginning of this journey, our intention is set: we are working towards furthering the transformation of our company and our deep belief in the opportunity these adjacent avenues of growth can bring in the long term, leveraging our ability to monetize the skills and assets we have accrued and developed during the process of our transformation. Philip Morris International Integrated Report 202226 27 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Governance Fundamentals Reporting and performance Business Transformation Metrics We can only achieve our purpose by embedding sustainability in all we do. The report content is informed by a formal sustainability materiality assessment conducted in 2021, which incorporates an assessment of our companys impacts on society and the planet, an evaluation of the potential impact of various ESG factors on our enterprise value, and the perspectives of diverse stakeholder groups (read more here). Company Management Anchoring our sustainability priorities with executive responsibilities and accountabilities helps embed our strategy into our daily operations. Our business transformation connects sustainability and corporate strategy, recognizing that ESG issues are business issues. In turn, our shareholders and stakeholders will be better able to assess how we are managing and improving on material ESG-related risk factors and how this is contributing to long-term value creation.

Our long-term success requires that we monitor, anticipate, and respond to the challenges and opportunities shaping our reality today and in the future. It spurs innovation, better positions the company for long-term success, and helps to address certain challenges stemming from our transition. Conclusion Based on the work we performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected Key Performance Indicators 2022 on the pages 26 and 190 to 191, respectively, (the metrics marked with an asterisk (*)) in the Business Transformation Metrics Reporting 2022 of Philip Morris International Inc. and subsidiaries for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 are not, in all material respects, prepared in accordance with the Business Transformation Framework and the footnotes on pages 26, 190 to 191 as well as in the Glossary (205 to 209). Safeguarding our long-term success requires that we monitor, anticipate, and respond to the challenges and opportunities shaping our reality today and in the future, ever mindful that the change we seek cannot be achieved in silos. Running to the end of 2025, it comprises 11 headline goals, each connected to our eight strategies, which aim to address our priority ESG topics identified by our sustainability materiality assessment."
Human Rights,"In 2023, we plan to publish a stand-alone Human Rights Report detailing our strategy to respect and protect human rights. PMI has a long-standing commitment to support the communities where our employees live and work. We aim to improve the livelihoods of the farmers supplying tobacco to PMI, thereby advancing the socioeconomic development of the communities.PMI seeks to educate and engage employees, relevant external stakeholders, and local communities in efforts to reduce littering. More than 2,000 employees across 42 markets participated in PMIs first Sustainability Challenge, which focused on how their individual actions can impact society and the environment.","We are at the early stage of this journey and are focused on building our understanding and identifying meaningful strategies to deploy in the years to come, grounded in our Human Rights Commitment and Responsible Sourcing Principles . Reinforcing our Human Rights Commitment At the end of 2022, we published our refreshed Human Rights Commitment , which articulates our pledge to respect human rights in all our operations and business relationships. This key step aims, as of 2023, to facilitate its accessibility and increase the number of colleagues across our global operations who can learn about human rights and our Commitment. This inaugural report will lay out our recently updated Human Rights Commitment (issued at the end of 2022), lessons learned, good practices in our ongoing work across our value chain, challenges faced, and future actions. C A S E S T U D Y Conducting an end-to- end human rights impact assessment in Malaysia In the first half of 2022, we completed our sixth country-level HRIA since 2018. The updated Human Rights Commitment is already included in our company-wide Business and Human Rights e-learning. Establishing a strong foundation and integrating into our organization mechanisms that promote respect for human rights are an essential part of our approach to business. Respect human rightsIn 2023, we plan to publish a stand-alone Human Rights Report, detailing our strategy to respect and protect human rights and our progress to date in implementing our Human Rights Commitment , first published in 2017. We will continue working on respecting human rights within our organization and across our value chain, taking a systematic approach following the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Medium- and low-priority improvement areas highlight gaps in environmental and human rights policies and reporting. To accelerate our progress on human rights, we published a strengthened Human Rights Commitment and completed our sixth and seventh human rights impact assessments, in Brazil and Malaysia. In particular, we reiterated our commitment to respect human rights and the due diligence we carry out, our tobacco purchasing requirements, and the most relevant social and environmental initiatives and remediation programs in place. Meanwhile, our broad and in-depth human rights impact assessmentswhich we aim to conduct in our 10 highest-risk countries by 2025provide us with granular insights into social challenges along our value chain. Finally, PMI extended to the OHCHRs independent human rights experts a formal invitation to meet with the company in Malawi, in order to facilitate further engagement and drive progress in the country. Our efforts to respect, promote, and protect human rights underlie many of the activities and programs described throughout this report. While this can be challenging given the breadth of our operations and the scope and complexity of the issues involved, we believe human rights are an absolute and universal requirementa requirement we are committed to upholding. We seek to place rights-holders, those individuals and communities whose rights could be impacted by our operations or business relationships, at the center of all we do. Meanwhile, our Operations Sustainability department is responsible for strategy development and stakeholder engagement, and acts as the center of expertise related to potential social issues. FUNDAMENTALSPhilip Morris International Integrated Report 2022174 175 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Governance Fundamentals Reporting and performanceHuman rights are inherent to the dignity of human life and a prerequisite for society to prosper. To succeed in this endeavor, we expect our suppliers to commit to respecting human rights within their business and we seek to collaborate with them, either individually or through various multistakeholder initiatives. As a global company, we work to uphold human rights within our organization and across our value chain. We seek to educate and engage employees, relevant external stakeholders, and local communities in efforts to reduce littering, to ensure consistency and coordination in our efforts, leading to more effective and efficient use of resources. Focused on environmental and social issues, some of these assessments include human rights risks saliency mapping, product life-cycle assessments, and deforestation and water risk assessments. In 2022, we also completed a human rights impact assessment in Malaysia, our first end-to-end exercise, looking at upstream as well as downstream.

Building on a solid foundation established over the past decade, we will continue strengthening our policies, processes, and programs to address social issues and create a positive change across our value chain. Read more about how we tackle human rights issues here. In 2021, we developed and introduced a self-assessment tool, which we piloted to help low- and medium-risk country markets identify salient human rights risks within their organizations, and develop action plans to address them. C A S E S T U D Y Assessing human rights impacts in Brazil We conducted another human rights impact assessment in the second half of 2022 constituting our seventh country-level assessment since 2018 to identify, prioritize, and help address potential risks and opportunities across our Brazilian affiliates value chain. These highlighted that the most common social issues relate to working time. 11 Our assessments prioritize countries which are assessed as highest risks from a human rights standpoint. Assessing human rights impacts across our markets To strengthen our due diligence framework, proactively identify risks, and mitigate potential adverse impacts in our operations and value chain, we have set an ambition to conduct human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) by 2025 in the 10 highest-risk countries in which we operate. Enhancing WASH infrastructure can substantially improve the well-being and livelihoods of community members. They are determined based on key parameters such as PMIs footprint and the countrys human rights risk profile, as determined by internationally recognized organizations.

We aim to generate at least USD 1 billion in annual net revenues from products in wellness and healthcare. We seek to achieve crop productivity, which can in turn free up land for other purposes.As of December 31, 2022, we managed our business in six geographical segments, a Swedish Match segment and a Wellness and Healthcare segment. We aim to protect ecosystems across our value chain and achieve no net biodiversity loss by 2033. We have ambitions in place to halt deforestation focused on achieving zero net deforestation of managed natural forests and no conversion of natural ecosystems in our tobacco supply chain.In 2022, 100 percent of the tobacco we purchased was cured with no risk of gross deforestation of primary or protected forests. The exercise identified ecosystem use and use change in the supply chain as the greatest driver of potential biodiversity loss. We are on track to achieving a deforestation-free supply chain.","We are progressing well toward our target to purchase tobacco at no risk of deforestation of managed natural forests and no conversion of natural ecosystems. Promoting the efficient use of natural resources and taking steps to protect, preserve, and improve them help manage risks and prepare us to meet regulatory frameworks that may emerge in response to increased awareness of our limited planetary boundaries, ecosystem degradation, and biodiversity loss. These areas include a surface buffer to consider potential indirect impacts on natural ecosystems beyond farm-level activities. We understand that biodiversity protection, forestry management, water stewardship, and waste reduction are deeply intertwined. With our programs, we seek to achieve crop productivity, which can in turn free up land for other purposes (such as food crops, other income- generating activities and, potentially, biodiversity conservation habitats) through cultivation practices promoting healthy crops and safeguarding biodiversity on farms and in surrounding areas. The unsustainable use of natural resources can lead to the loss of fundamental ecosystem services we depend on, including soil fertility, clean air and water, protection from natural disasters, and recreational and cultural inspiration, and a subsequent loss of economic value.

As part of our climate strategy and accounting for synergies with our nature protection ambition, we will continue to identify and invest in nature-based solutions that focus on protecting nature by avoiding deforestation, improving nature through community projects, and fostering natural ecosystems beyond forests. Further, we understand that we all have a responsibility to halt the destruction of natural habitats, including avoiding and compensating for losses, and failure to play our part in helping address this global issue could lead to reputational damage for our company. We started to account for biodiversity impacts related to our business in 2019 by testing the Mean Species Abundance (MSA) metric on selected business areas and we participated in 2020 in CSR Europes evaluation of the maturity of biodiversity practices. In conjunction with the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP 15) in December, we announced new long-term biodiversity and water ambitions and strategies, aligned with the post-2020 biodiversity framework adopted by parties to the convention. In our direct operations, attention should be paid to the proximity of our sites to protected and key biodiversity areas, and on the implementation of good environmental practices at our manufacturing sites. Risks are related to degradation of the natural environment linked to loss of ecosystem areas, chemical pollution, and invasive species. We continued investing in nature-based solutions that focus on protecting nature by (1) avoiding deforestation, (2) improving nature through community projects, and (3) fostering natural ecosystems beyond forests. Further, the audit confirmed that 55 percent of our purchased tobacco was not posing a risk of deforestation of managed natural forest nor conversion of natural ecosystems (2021: 37 percent). Setting our ambition on nature We published a dedicated report at the end of 2022 describing our ambition to contribute toward a net positive impact on nature, and announcing related new aspirations that will guide our work to protect biodiversity and steward water in the decades to come. Global scientific studies indicate that biodiversity is deteriorating worldwide at rates unprecedented in human history, with one million plant and animal species facing extinction, thousands of species already extinct, and several million hectares of natural forest lost each year despite international efforts to counter the trend. 1 The Mean Species Abundance (MSA) metric uses coefficients of biodiversity loss to account for impacts and dependencies with intensity of associated pressures. Tree growing requires careful management and is limited to marginal lands where the carbon stock and existing biodiversity assets, including soil, can be enhanced. We participate in international forums such as CSR Europes Biodiversity & Industry Platform, WBCSDs working groups on nature and forests, and Business for Nature, and we leverage the work of the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN).

Management approach We are committed to the responsible and sustainable management of natural resources. We aim to protect ecosystems across our value chain and achieve no net biodiversity loss by 2033. We will then fine-tune a detailed roadmap to 2033 by integrating water stewardship milestones, including specific targets, and fully developing the interlinks with other areas of environmental sustainability such as biodiversity protection and waste management. In 2022, we conducted an in-depth assessment of our biodiversity footprint, completing two analyses covering the most relevant segments of our value chain, which include our tobacco supply chain, our paper and pulp-based materials supply chain, and our direct operations: A land-based assessment of the biodiversity extent, condition, and significance (BECS), resulting in PMIs total land occupancy footprint of close to 3,500 MSA.km.1 The exercise identified ecosystem use and use change in the supply chain as the greatest driver of potential biodiversity loss A resource use-based assessment based on the Global Biodiversity Score (GBS), resulting in a determination of PMIs total footprint of 405 MSA.km. Preserve nature INWARD IMPACT: The business case Our business activities rely on healthy ecosystems. In this section Protecting biodiversity 152 Halting deforestation 154 Managing water responsibly 158 Reducing waste 162We routinely conduct global and local risk assessments to evaluate our impacts on biodiversity, forests, and water, and we prioritize and adjust our actions accordingly. We welcome the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) to halt biodiversity loss convened at the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD). Setting our ambition on biodiversity The work carried out in 2022 allowed us to develop intermediate and long-term aspirations that will guide our efforts to protect biodiversity in the years to come. Designing a holistic biodiversity strategy We understand that building a meaningful and global approach to biodiversity requires the conscious cross- pollination of various strategies and interventions. OUTWARD IMPACT: The right thing to do We collectively depend on soil, land, forests, and water, which provide ecosystem services critical to human existence. Enhancing natural capital through reforestation and afforestation As part of our efforts to halt deforestation and enhance natural habitats, we require that our suppliers and farmers be self-sufficient in sustainably supplying wood for curing and barn construction, and, by 2025, we aim for them to grow more trees than they cut. Under his leadership, our Operations team is responsible for developing and implementing strategies to achieve our ambitions related to biodiversity, forests, water, and waste. Project outcomes include carbon sequestration through the reforestation of degraded land, ecosystems restoration, and social benefits to the local community such as securing access to sustainable wood to tobacco farmers who depend on it. We monitor compliance with the ZDM by considering not only farm boundaries but looking at natural forest cover changes in areas of interest we call tobacco-growing areas (TGAs). As a global player with a diversified value chain, we recognize the role we can play in taking actions to halt biodiversity losses and are committed to contribute to a nature-positive future in line with the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Yet species richness and natural resources are being lost at an alarming rate. In 2022, 100 percent of the tobacco we purchased was cured with no risk of gross deforestation of primary or protected forests for the third consecutive year. For example, one MSA.km represents an area of complete biodiversity loss.

Supply Chain Management,"PMI's aim is to provide a decent livelihood to all contracted farmers in our tobacco supply chain. Beyond tobacco, we are taking steps to leverage the extensive learnings from the ALP program and our human rights impact assessments. We are well on track to achieve a deforestation- free supply chain . In 2022, an internal multistakeholder team continued to develop the strategy for our non-tobacco supply chain carbon footprint reduction.In 2022, our critical suppliers of direct materials assessed in EcoVadis achieved an average Social score of 58 out of 100 . The exercise focused on Malaysia and aimed to identify relevant risks and opportunities across our local affiliates value chain. In our non-tobacco supply chain, emphasis needs to be put on the deforestation risks linked to the sourcing of paper and pulp-based materials.","Maintaining full traceability and monitoring in our tobacco supply chain To a large extent, responsible sourcing stems from strong relationships on the ground. In addition to the nature of the component, a suppliers criticality is also evaluated on the basis of spend segmentation and supply flexibility, as relevant. 5 Suppliers criticality is evaluated considering spend segmentation and nature of component, as well as supply flexibility (single-source/not easily substitutable) as relevant. Proud of the progress we have achieved in our tobacco supply chain, we will continue to expand and develop a social sustainability strategy that is able to respond to our transforming supply chain addressing impacts present in the rest of our value chain, increasing transparency, and ensuring robust data reporting. Engaging with our broader supply chain to contribute to suppliers transition toward a net zero economy is therefore at the heart of our approach. In 2022, we performed an extensive analysis of PMIs current footprint and due diligence framework in our electronics supply chain, considering evolving regulations and available benchmarks. In addition to our RSP, we apply tailored due diligence instruments and mechanisms within specific segments of our supply chain. Beyond our tobacco supply chain, we will enhance our efforts and expand our strategy and focus into our electronics supply chain, by further leveraging our Responsible Business Alliance membership. As our company transforms and welcomes Swedish Match organization, we will work to integrate its supply chain to find synergies that may result in changes to sourcing supply. Management PMIs Senior Vice President of Operations, a member of our Company Management, is accountable for our strategy related to supply chain management and relevant programs. 9 Following the introduction in 2022 of PMIs sustainable supply chain model, data on tobacco farmers contracted by PMI tobacco suppliers are not available. The remaining portion for full conversion initially planned in 2022 was delayed due to supply chain and local market challenges; we anticipate to complete it in the coming years. For example, we had to put plans in place to mitigate the adverse impact of supply chain disruption and geopolitical shifts resulting from the war in Ukraine. Regarding the agricultural supply chain work, the operational responsibility lies with our Vice President of Global Technical Operations department, and in each sourcing region, a management team oversees its implementation. Our tobacco supply chain Our tobacco supply chain represented around 15.7 percent of our total carbon footprint in 2022. Challenges The geopolitical situation in Europe, war in Ukraine, and adverse impact of supply chain disruption have impacted our decarbonization plans, especially those focused on scope 3, requiring us at times to assume trade-offs between financial and natural capital to ensure business continuity. In our electronics supply chain, we leverage the work of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). In particular, in 2022, they increased versus 2021 due to the adverse impact of supply chain disruption and geopolitical shifts resulting from the war in Ukraine. In 2022, an internal multistakeholder team continued the work of developing the strategy for our non-tobacco supply chain carbon footprint reduction, including an additional focus on transportation and warehousing categories. This report will share details related to our desired impact, benefits, challenges, and actions that we will take in order to mitigate potential unintended consequences derived from reporting data which relates only to that tobacco we purchase, instead of the total contracted farm base of our suppliers in the tobacco growing areas where we purchase, which include farmers that are not part of our supply chain. We have therefore set a new baseline by implementing our Sustainable Tobacco Supply Chain (STSC) framework, excluding prior year data, throughout this report. Our supply chain activities and investments extend beyond our direct effect on farmers, impacting peoples assets, capabilities, opportunities, and standards of living. Assessing the sustainability performance of our indirect spend supply chain Alongside our activities on prioritized spend categories, during 2022 we further explored our indirect spend supply chain. Our approach to sustainable supply chain management is built on the following core principles: Proactive engagement with our suppliers is key to fostering open and transparent relationships in which expertise is shared and built together. To enhance our supply chain sustainability and achieve tangible environmental and social improvements, we identify and address current and potential risks while seizing opportunities to create a positive impact in the communities in which we and our suppliers operate. Due to supply chain and local market challenges, the remaining portion for full conversion is anticipated in the coming years. We continue to engage with our suppliers to improve visibility in this complex supply chain and enhance our due diligence framework. In recognition of our actions and strategies to reduce emissions and climate-related risks in our supply chain, CDP placed PMI on its Supplier Engagement Leaderboard in 2022 for the sixth consecutive year. Manage our supply chain sustainably Fostering collaboration with our network of suppliers We engage and seek to influence a large number of our supplierscompanies with a diverse set of strategies, priorities, and culturesto jointly progress on our sustainability journey. Read the case study herePLACEHOLDER IMAGEOur supply chain accounts for a significant portion of our potential social and environmental risks and impacts. In addition, we set a new target validated by the SBTi in 2022 on the percentage of supply chain spend covered by suppliers with their own science-based targets. Our direct materials supply chain Our supply chain, beyond tobacco and electronics, is broad and complex (read more here ), facing a large set of social risks. When it comes to PMIs work in the broader supply chain, including electronics, the operational responsibility lies with PMIs Chief Procurement Officer. Electronics supply chain As our company transforms, a key area of focus is our expanding electronics manufacturing supply base. 2 Total supply chain spend includes procurement spend and tobacco leaf sourcing spend. Monitoring the sustainability performance of our critical suppliers We deploy tailored due diligence instruments across our direct materials, electronics, tobacco, and indirect materials and services supply chains. In 2021, we identified an insetting project opportunity in our supply chain in Mozambique. Insetting in our tobacco supply chain to compensate for our direct emissions We want to promote insetting by implementing nature- based solutions in our tobacco supply chain. To support decarbonization efforts, PMI believes that limiting the use of market approaches (offsetting) in the short term by prioritizing direct investment in our supply chain in the medium and long term (insetting) will result in a climate investment strategy that is cost- effective, transparent, consistent, and of high quality. We are committed to sourcing sustainably from all our critical suppliers (read more here ) and conducting human rights impact assessments in our 10 highest-risk markets by 2025 (read more here )."

This will include ramping up training on health and safety for our employees, contracted employees and contractors working at our premises. The top three direct causes of injury in 2022 included cutting by sharp object (20 percent), contact with moving machinery (15 percent), and slip, trip or fall on the same level (12 percent). These systems enable us to analyze safety losses and to prioritize, plan, and monitor health and safety performance. Protecting the health, safety, and security of our employees We have embedded clear methodologies, We have embedded clear methodologies, procedures, and robust controls in our procedures, and robust controls in our factories, offices, and fleet aimed at factories, offices, and fleet aimed at ensuring that our employees and others ensuring that our employees and others on-site stay safe. 6 PMI employees and contracted employees: zero fatalities in 2022; contractors: three fatalities in 2022. Through our fleet safety management program, based on recognized standards including ISO 14001 and ISO 39001, we equip PMI with standards, tools, training, and capabilities to protect the safety of all personnel driving company vehicles. Notes Since the onset of the war in Ukraine, PMIs main priority has been the safety and security of its more than 1,300 employees and their families in the country. This helps ensure the safety of company personnel in the office, in the field, on the road, and while traveling. In 2022, field technicians recorded a total of 5,490 prompt actions related to unsafe working environments. Across the countries from which we source tobacco, the most recurrent and difficult challenges relate to a safe work environment and usage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Telematics and subsequent analytics allow us to proactively improve driving behaviors, reduce fatalities and injuries, and decrease carbon emissions (read more here ). In March 2022, we piloted the inclusion of questions in our employee listening surveys exploring psychological safety for the first time. A second challenge in 2022 has been the resumption of full activity after the COVID-19 pandemic, as we work now to increase the cadence of site visits and simultaneously ensure that remotely hired or working employees are properly onboarded into PMIs safety culture. Our health and safety performance monitoring covers PMI employees, contracted workers who are under the direct supervision of PMI but employed by a temporary employment agency (we had around 6,990 contracted employees on average per month in 2022, compared with 7,300 in 2021), and contractors when on PMI premises (see Glossary for definitions). We seek to protect our employees and other road users by providing safe vehicles and driver safety awareness programs to achieve zero preventable fleet safety accidents. This means ensuring that our employees experience fair working conditions, opportunities to develop skills and boost their employability, and a workplace that protects and promotes their psychological and physical health, safety, and well-being. We responded to this challenge by reinforcing the frequency and breadth of safety inspections by site leadership teams outside of production areas to ensure that unsafe conditions are identified and eliminated. We advance this culture through two-way communication with employees, addressing the top-three unsafe behaviors through systematic actions and safety alerts or notice boards. On February 25, 2022, in order to preserve the safety of its employees, PMI announced the temporary suspension of its commercial and manufacturing operations in Ukraine, including at its factory, in Kharkiv. An Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) pillar is established in all manufacturing sites, which focuses on building capabilities across the organization to autonomously identify, classify, and mitigate risks, through daily management systems applied at all levels of the organization. In 2022, our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) for employees, contracted employees, and contractors was 0.12 (2021: 0.09). In 2022, we also recalibrated our approach to safety training and developed a global manufacturing comprehensive year-long program covering leadership and culture, technical safety, governance, environment, and the OHS agenda. Lessons learned from the investigations highlighted the necessity for motorbike-specific defensive- driving training, along with the continued deployment of our robust fleet safety management program.

PMI has established a thorough monitoring process to enable early detection of consumer pain points. Our corporate targets on incidents help us evaluate the effectiveness of our safety policies and programs. One of the key challenges we encountered in 2022 was the proportion of incidents occurring in non- production areas within our manufacturing sites, because historically there has been a greater focus on safety on the production floor. The following can, for example, be hazardous, particularly without the proper personal protective equipment (PPE): applying crop protection agents (CPA); stalk cutting; stringing; carrying heavy loads; working with sharp tools; working in extreme temperatures; and working after dark. Our target is to reduce high-severity collisions, with an ongoing goal of eliminating fatal accidents completely. The health impact of cigarette smoking is the most significant and pressing negative externality our strategy aims to address."

Operational Eco-Efficiency,"In 2022, we remained on track to achieve our target of 100 percent of electricity used and purchased in our factories derived from renewable sources by 2025. In 2022, 74 percent of the flue-cured tobacco we purchased was cured using renewable and traceable fuels (2021: 75 percent). While our emissions have dropped from our baseline year, they did not fall as much as planned in 2022.We exceeded targeted reductions needed to meet our science-based target for reduction in absolute scope 1+2 GHG emissions. In 2022, emissions related to the use of fertilizers in tobacco production contributed to 9 .0 percent of our total carbon footprint. We remain focused on retiring our most polluting cars subject to the availability of appropriate infrastructure, legislation, and technological innovation. We have specific mid-term targets and strategies in place that account for our most significant impacts on climate.Carbon emissions along our value chain in 2022. Presentation of information aligns with guidance of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. To reduce carbon emissions in our fleet, we invest in sustainable powertrains and effective driving to optimize energy consumption and improve operational efficiency.","While every solution is tailored to the specific energy profile of the site, our program is based on a general framework that considers self-generated renewable energy, electrification of heat production systems, and switch to bio-based fuels where possible. S. For example, a pilot study was conducted in our Brazil flue-cured market to use photovoltaic energy systems in curing barns while reducing overall fuel consumption. We invest in optimizing energy and process efficiencies and replacing fossil fuel-based energy with renewable sources. To mitigate this, we are focusing on increasing the share of green energy used and accelerating the deployment of energy-saving initiatives in those facilities under our ownership. In total, 5.0 percent of our energy use was self-generated in 2022 (2021: 7.0 percent). Switching to renewable energy In parallel, we are continuing our gradual switch to renewable energy sources. Philip Morris International Integrated Report 2022138 139 Overview Strategy Operational impact Product impact Governance Fundamentals Reporting and performancePromoting energy efficiency We rely first on promoting efficient energy use across our factories. This is a decrease of 5 percent compared with the previous year (2021: 41,167 hectares) driven by a different curing fuel mix in certain markets compared with the previous period and increased efficiency of the curing process, thereby reducing fuel consumption. Our strategy to decarbonize our factories focuses on enhancing energy efficiency and switching to renewables, and is underpinned by the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. Many of our zero-carbon technologies aim to generate renewable energy, such as photovoltaic panels, biomass boilers and heat pumps, and tri-generation processes (combining cooling, heating, and power). 2 Excludes electricity consumption from fleet. We anticipate these technologies will help drive progress toward our aspiration of having 100 percent of renewable electricity sourced in our factories globally and increasing self-generation of our electricity needs. This includes energy savings and environmental benefits such as reduced water consumption and waste generation (read more about maximizing resource efficiency in our operations here ). To reduce carbon emissions in our fleet, we invest in sustainable powertrains and effective driving to optimize energy consumption and improve operational efficiency. In addition to self-generated renewable electricity production, we continue to consider opportunities to source electricity through power purchase agreements (PPAs) in the future. In parallel, through our suppliers we continued to deliver training to farmers on fuel consumption efficiency, barn maintenance, and fuel sustainability attributes. In 2022, we remained on track to achieve our target of 100 percent of electricity used and purchased in our factories derived from renewable sources by 2025, achieving 87 percent. In past years, we continued our efforts to certify our factories as carbon neutral, focusing primarily on efficiency gains and a switch to renewable energy. There is broad scientific consensus about the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to limit the rise in the global temperature to 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels, aligned with the Paris Agreement. Progress in 2022 Overview of our carbon footprint We calculate our GHG footprint annually, We calculate our GHG footprint annually, following guidance from the Greenhouse following guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and accounting for all emissions Gas Protocol and accounting for all emissions generated across our value chain.

To guard the success of our carbon neutrality target and minimize adverse impacts of the geopolitical situation in Europe, we decided to increase our climate investments in projects generating carbon credits, avoiding or removing carbon from the atmosphere with strong focus on nature-based solutions, though our primary focus remains on reducing our absolute GHG emissions. In line with PMIs 2040 net zero ambition, we aspire to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 25 percent versus our 2019 baseline by 2025 and 50 percent by 2030. Through the ZCT program, we expect to replace 35 percent of our fossil fuel use by green energy and to increase the share of in-house produced renewable electricity by 10 percent by 2025 (versus a 2021 baseline). We continued to strengthen our carbon accounting, notably increasing the proportion of primary GHG emissions data collected from our suppliers.
