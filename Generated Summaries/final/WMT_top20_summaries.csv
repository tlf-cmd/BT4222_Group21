Suppliers supplying Walmart private brand products in departments most likely to contain pulp and paper were identified and encouraged to participate in Walmarts pulp and paper survey.

The GHG Protocol outlines three emissions sources (referred to as scopes) that provide the framework for operational boundaries. We engage Lucideon CICS to independently verify Walmarts reported scope 1 and scope 2 emissions as reported to CDP annually, pursuant to ISO 14064-3 (the international standard for verification of Greenhouse Gas inventories). Annual scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions and Carbon Intensities are updated from time to time for changes in emission factors or activity data when more accurate information become available. As a result, we estimated some of our scope 1 and 2 emissions for the calendar year 2020 reporting for our Argentina, U. This spring, we hit a major milestone with Project Gigaton: We are halfway toward our goal to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of greenhouse gases from the global supply chain by 2030.

On an adjusted basis between 2015 calendar year baseline and 2020, Walmart reduced its absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 15.6%, equivalent to 3.0 million metric tons of CO 2e.

In the lead up to COP26 in Glasgow, many companies set goals to help the world get to net-zero emissions. scope 2 (market-based) emissions include the carbon reduction value of renewable electricity procured from onsite and offsite projects. Since 2017, our suppliers have reported a cumulative total of more than 574 million metric tons of emissions reduced or avoided. 39 While scope 2 emissions in 2020 declined by 11% over 2019, 2020 scope 1 emissions increased by approximately 6% due primarily to increases in onsite refrigerant and transport fuel emissions."
