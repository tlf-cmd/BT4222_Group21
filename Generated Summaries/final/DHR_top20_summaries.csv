REDUCTION IN SCOPE 1 AND 2 GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTION IN PERCENTAGE OF WASTE SENT TO LANDFILL OR INCINERATION50.4% 15%In this report, we are announcing our intention to reduce Danahers Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50.4% on an absolute basis by 2032 (compared to a baseline year of 2021)a reduction target that aligns to the prevailing climate science goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Blair President and Chief Executive Officer We are announcing a new 2032 target to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% Sunrise at Badi Lake, India by Dhruval Patel, Leica Biosystems associateI am pleased to reaffirm Danahers support of the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. To that end, we are announcing a new 2032 goal to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% (on an absolute basis) compared to 2021 levels, which aligns to the prevailing climate science goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Our new goal builds upon our more than 29% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (normalized to revenue) from 2019 to 2021, which substantially exceeded our original five-year reduction target of 15%. In addition, Danahers businesses are increasingly focused on improving efficiency across our production and distribution processes, production assets, buildings and transport/mobility in relation to energy and water consumption and waste generation. Danaher applied the following methodology with respect to the metrics and goals included in this Report relating to energy, GHG emissions, water and waste (environmental metrics). This new, science-aligned goal supersedes our prior intensity-based GHG and energy reduction targets and represents an even more ambitious reduction goal. This new goal supersedes the company's prior intensity-based GHG and energy reduction targets. This years report conveys the depth and scope of our commitment to sustainability and details a number of important milestones we have achieved over the past year, including the evolution of our sustainability strategy, the introduction of several new life-changing technologies, an expanded commitment to diversity and inclusion (D+I), and ambitious new greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. The 2019, 2020, and 2021 environmental metrics reflect adjustments made to account for changes in GHG accounting methodology (updates in emission factors used, including location-based emissions and market-based emissions in Scope 2 inventory) as well to include emissions from the acquisition of Cytiva. In addition, in line with the TCFD recommendations to disclose metrics and targets used to assess and manage climate-related risks, we disclose our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and reduction goals in this report. We expect that our powerful suite of DBS tools and processes, including the DBS Energy Management Toolkit, will be key drivers of future GHG reductions. In the Protecting Our Environment section of this report, we discuss steps Danaher has taken to mitigate the potential impact of these types of physical risks to facilities as well as our efforts to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions. Through a combination of energy kaizens and procuring renewable electricity from our suppliers, Leica Microsystems reduced absolute CO2 emissions by more than 30% in 2021 vs. 2019.Generating Energy On-Site Leica Microsystems facility in Wetzlar, Germany features an on-site natural gas combined heat and power (CHP) plant that supplies one-third of the facilitys annual electricity requirements (approximately 1,300 megawatt hours) as well as heat for the facility. With DBS as our driving force, weve developed DBS tools designed specifically to reduce energy consumption and waste generation, and we are currently piloting a DBS tool to reduce water consumption. We are developing a suite of tools and processes to drive this effort, with the DBS Energy Management Toolkit as our foundation. SITE RESULTS SINCE 2019: Conducted 46 improvement projects focused on water savings Water efficiency +33% Energy efficiency +18% Total CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) -22% Equivalent of $2 million of annual cost savingsENVIRONMENT UN: SDG 62022 Danaher Sustainability Report48Helping Our Customers Reduce Their Environmental Impact Below we share a few examples of the ways our operating companies innovative technologies are helping customers reduce their environmental impact. Hachs facility in Berlin, Germany has installed a natural gas CHP plant, which provides heat for the facility while recovering electricity. The energy usage and GHG emissions metrics are based on available activity data of fuel consumed on- site, purchased energy and energy consumed through operation of Danaher-owned or -leased vehicles and aircraft. This eliminated the need for 18,100 trucks on the road, 10,000 gallons of gasoline and 909,000 trucking milesequivalent to two round trips to the moonand saved 3.4 million pounds of CO2. In 2021, Pall Life Sciences spent 13% less per revenue dollar on energy, gas and water compared to 2019.

Moraine Lake in Banff National Park, Canada by Alina Chernin, Danaher Corporate associateFOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS GRI: 102-15, 102-29, 102-302022 Danaher Sustainability Report69 With our global physical footprint, a key climate related risk for Danaher is physical risk resulting from acute or chronic changes in climate patterns. Below is a summary of the pilot program: The program is designed to run parallel to our annual ERM process and would require each in-scope operating company to identify (and score the severity, probability and velocity of) each key climate-related risk, over short- medium- and long-term time horizons. Danaher anticipates reporting on any key climate- related risks and opportunities identified as a result of this process in our annual sustainability report. GRI: 102-14, UN: SDG 3, 132022 Danaher Sustainability Report5 Protecting Our Environment As global stewards of the environment, we recognize an increasingly urgent need to take swift action to address climate change. Danaher has previously identified the following high- level climate-related risks and opportunities: Midnight Sun in Lidingo, Sweden by Greg Beuneu, Cytiva associate GRI: 102-15, 102-29, 102-30, 201-2 TCFD: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management UN: SDG 132022 Danaher Sustainability Report70Political Matters In all communications, associates must make clear that political views and actions are their own and not those of Danaher. Chronic physical risks refer to longer-term shifts in climate patterns (such as sustained higher temperatures) that may result in rising sea levels (which could impact our facilities in coastal areas), droughts and heat waves. Key climate-related opportunities for Danaher include the prospect of developing new commercial solutions to address customers sustainability related needs and potentially reduce our operating costs. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration rely on these instruments for accurate and actionable data to better understand weather patterns, changes in ocean environments, and the implications of climate change. Acute physical risks include increased severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes and floods. The program would also require identification (and scoring) of each key climate-related opportunity, over short- medium- and long-term time horizons."

The goal of our ERM program is to comprehensively inventory and mitigate key risks across all of Danahers platforms and operating companies. The Boards role in risk oversight is consistent with Danahers leadership structure: management has day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing Danahers risk exposure, and the Board and its Audit Committee oversee those efforts, with emphasis on our most significant risks. For each identified risk that exceeds a prescribed score, the operating company would be required to identify the anticipated business and financial impact of the risk and planned countermeasures. It also gives our leadership visibility into key existing and emerging business risks and countermeasures and enables us to mitigate risks as dictated by our risk-reward assessment.

The risk data collected is used to support effective business decision-making and assess risk-reward tradeoffs. The monitoring encompasses dozens of risk categories, including financial, weather-related, cyber, geopolitical and other risk types. The strength of our ERM program lies in the autonomy we give our operating companies to think broadly about the risks they face and determine how best to mitigate them. Enterprise Risk Management Methodology At the beginning of the annual ERM process, our corporate risk management function communicates the key elements of the ERM program to our platforms and operating companies, highlighting any year-over-year changes. The policy sets forth a detailed security incident management and reporting protocol, with clear escalation timelines and responsibilities. Our annual Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program is the key management program that underpins our risk oversight function. The risk profile of our medical device portfolio differs from that of many of our medical device peers. The leadership of each operating company is responsible for the timely completion of all countermeasures resulting from the ABC risk assessment. Key program elements include: An inventory and classification of key risk areas and key risk topics A methodology for scoring risks based on the risks probability, severity and velocity of impact, and for trending key risks A framework for developing countermeasures for key risks A process for assigning responsibility and deadlines for the implementation of countermeasures, and re-assessing such risks following implementation of the applicable countermeasures A timeline for collection and synthesis of the risk assessment data and reporting of key risks and countermeasures to the Danaher Risk Committee and the Danaher Board of Directors ERM-specific DBS tools, including an action plan template and a methodology for identifying fundamental elements, establishing the jumping off point and tracking planned vs. actual improvements each month Risk Oversight RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS Each operating company assesses its respective risks using the prescribed methodology and communicates the results to its respective platform risk committee.

Danaher utilizes a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to its supply chain, including in certain cases the use of safety stock, alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources.

These physical risks may have financial implications for Danaher, such as direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption. In addition, our supplier risk assessment/risk management program and our EcoVadis supplier sustainability due diligence, assessment and monitoring program assess and monitor supplier human rights practices, among other topics. SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT AND SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN POLICY Outline our expectations regarding the extension of our EHS values throughout our supply chain, including the assessment and monitoring of our suppliers environmental performance through the EcoVadis platform. The EcoVadis rating a Danaher supplier receives could impact the frequency of subsequent EcoVadis assessments or could require the supplier to develop a Corrective Action Plan targeting specific improvement, among other impacts. We require any supplier who exceeds a specified risk assessment score to develop and implement a risk management plan (RMP). The iterative elements of SQM include criteria for supplier qualification and processes to measure and monitor supplier performance, implement corrective actions and improve supplier performance. As a result, we view our supply chain as an extension of our own business and expect our suppliers to share our values. Supplier Risk Assessment/ Risk Management We have a rigorous supply chain risk assessment/risk management program that incorporates supplier financial and risk data from external providers as well as Danaher internal data. In 2021, we conducted business with over 80,000 suppliers globally, and our supply chain spending exceeded $9 billiona reach that offers us the opportunity to drive our sustainability values across a footprint far broader than our direct operations. Please refer to the Supply Chain Sustainability section of this report for additional detail. Sustainable Supply Chain Policy; Details Danahers requirements and expectations with respect to the extension of our sustainability values across our supply chain. Supplier Quality Management One of the key elements of the Danaher Reliability System is the Supplier Quality Management (SQM) process, which applies across Danaher and its operating companies. Where appropriate we provide training and other development support to improve supplier performance, which may include supplier corrective action plans, supplier development plans, DBS- based improvement activities, process audits and/or business reviews. No single supplier is significant to Danaher as a whole, although for some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or other qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide them. In 2022, we anticipate that EcoVadis will assess and rate suppliers representing approximately 50% of our annual supplier spend, including Danahers preferred suppliers (preferred suppliers are suppliers whom Danahers subsidiaries have targeted for growth because they offer the opportunity for a high level of strategic and operational value). The RMP may include financial monitoring, business continuity planning, supplier training/development, additional contractual provisions and tooling assessments. Please refer to the Danaher Sustainable Supply Chain Policy for additional details. While recognizing differences in laws, customs and acceptable practices around the world, we believe shared values are the cornerstone of supplier relationships and we articulate our expectations through the following policies: Supplier Code of Conduct; Sets forth the requirements and expectations we have of our suppliers with respect to legal compliance and ethical business practices. Danaher engages a third party to continuously monitor media and other publicly available data sources to identify risks relating to its direct material suppliers. Please refer to our Sustainable Supply Chain Policy for additional details. All suppliers are expected to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets forth our expectations around supplier business practices, including human rights. Danahers Vice President of Global Procurement and Supply Chain, who reports to Danahers Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for Danahers supply chain sustainability program. In particular, in-scope suppliers are monitored on a real-time basis with respect to specific KPIs including U. Danahers Vice President of Global Procurement and Supply Chain, who reports to Danahers Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for our supply chain human rights program, and Danahers Senior Vice President of Human Resources is responsible for human rights in our direct operations. In our medical device businesses, the SQM both supports and incorporates applicable medical device regulatory requirements, including supplier audits where required. Sustainability Due Diligence, Assessment and Monitoring We have partnered with EcoVadis, a globally recognized provider of business sustainability assessments and ratings, to assess and monitor our direct and indirect supplier sustainability performance. SUPPLY CHAIN We expect our suppliers to share our commitment to respect human rights. By seeking to partner with suppliers and customers, we believe we can help address some of the worlds most pressing environmental issues more broadly and effectively than we could on our own. Suppliers to Danaher are required to commit to being or becoming conflict-free (meaning they do not source conflict minerals) and sourcing only from conflict-free smelters. Danaher requires suppliers to provide completed Responsible Minerals Initiative Conflict Minerals Reporting Template declarations detailing their commitment to becoming conflict- free and documenting countries of origin for any tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold purchased. The following examples demonstrate how our innovative solutions are used to protect the worlds most precious resources.
