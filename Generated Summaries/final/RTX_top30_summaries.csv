Supply Chain Management,"Raytheon is developing a supplier sustainability plan to engage with and assess the programs and performance of our supply base. The GCS program is a cross-functional collaboration principally between Engineering and Operations & Supply Chain teams.The ESG Steering Committee includes the senior vice president of operations and supply chain, chief communications officer, chief human resources officer, the chief financial officer and the general counsel. This is Raytheon Technologies first comprehensive ESG report. We recognize the need to leverage our relationships with our suppliers.","We also participate in industry and non-governmental organizations focused on reducing supply chain risks and environmental impacts, including the International Aerospace Environmental Group and the Responsible Minerals Initiative. We continue to innovate and are developing a supplier sustainability plan to engage with and assess the programs and performance of our supply base. The GCS program is a cross-functional collaboration principally between our Engineering and Operations & Supply Chain teams. To further ensure the strength of our supply chain, we take a number of measures, including: Performing initial and periodic screenings of all suppliers. Requiring each of our business units to have an alert management system in place to support rapidly identifying, monitoring and resolving supplier issues when they arise, consistent with the 8D methodology in AS13000. Our first-tier suppliers may be required to flow these same requirements to all levels of the supply chain. The senior vice presidents of operations, supply chain, quality and EH&S and the vice president of EH&S oversee our EH&S efforts. Members of the enterprisewide Raytheon Technologies Supply Chain Council and Quality Council, as well as the Contracts and Legal organizations also provide oversight for supply chain matters. This plan will enable continued awareness and knowledge to support improvements in our supply chain. Increased costs due to weather damage to company assets, business interruption, customer and supply chain impacts, and employee disruptions. The BRCM program is run by the vice president, chief security officer, who reports to the corporate senior vice president of operations and supply chain. Our efforts start at the top, where supply chain compliance is led by the senior vice president, operations and supply chain, who briefs the Board of Directors on supply chain matters annually. To cascade this impact throughout our supply chain, our Supplier Code requires each of our suppliers to, among other things, have management systems, tools and processes to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the requirements contained in the Supplier Code. The impacts of potential physical risks go well beyond the physical boundaries of our facilities and include our employees, supply chain, distribution networks and customers. GCSEC members include vice presidents from supply chain, operations, quality, legal, and research and development. We strive to accomplish this objective by continually improving our people and our processes, sharing best practices across our business units and throughout our supply chain, and promoting an ethical culture. Decisions and processes are then filtered down to each business unit and every supplier through our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Quality Policy. These audits may include the supply chain, where suppliers may be audited for compliance based on risk. Collaborating with suppliers Our supplier relationships are critical to the continued success of our business. Among other things, the Supplier Code requires all suppliers to conduct operations in a manner that: Complies with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and directives.

Operational Eco-Efficiency,"Reducing equipment energy consumption directly translates into lower overall aircraft fuel consumption and lower emissions. A central decarbonization strategy involves reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency in our operations. In 2021, Raytheon Technologies business units invested over $12million in energy reduction-related projects.Figures from 2020 and 2021 reflect reduced GHG emissions due to the COVID-19 pandemics effect on the commercial aviation sector. We are making enhancements in product energy efficiency, such as fielding of gallium nitride (GaN) in radars. Decarbonize our operations by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 46% from 2019 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement.","To help drive our energy reductions, we established a goal to reduce energy consumption 2.5% by 2025 from 2019 levels. We focus on reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency in our operations worldwide, including involvement in renewable electricity projects and contracts. Ongoing efforts to reduce energy consumption and decarbonize our facilities through efficiency projects, equipment updates, facility modernization and renewable energy. Reducing equipment energy consumption directly translates into lower overall aircraft fuel consumption and lower emissions. Therefore, a central decarbonization strategy involves reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency in our operations. We are also focused on improving energy efficiency in aircraft equipment. Our efforts to improve equipment energy efficiency include: Deploying an electrified ECS for the Boeing 787, one of the clean-sheet-design aircraft in the new century. Improving the energy efficiency of power electronics used in power distribution systems and motor drives through the use of advanced electronic designs and more efficient semiconductor devices. Via an innovative semi-closed system architecture, HySIITE aims to achieve thermal efficiency greater than fuel cells and reduce total operating cost to be comparable with drop in SAF. A production aircraft with two hybrid-electric engines has the potential to reduce fuel consumption by 30% for short haul flights. We are constantly looking to identify and execute energy conservation and efficiency projects. We have established a cross-functional team to assist business units and sites in their energy reduction programs. In 2021, we implemented more than 100 energy reduction projects of various size and reach. Currently, 3.5% of our electricity, inclusive of all global sites, is from renewable energy resources (up from 1.5% in 2020) and we are actively looking to increase this proportion.
