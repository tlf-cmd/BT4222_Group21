The organization works to drive greater business condence for global seafood buyers purchasing from Asia by tackling illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) shing; establishing supply chain oversight from vessel to plate; mitigating risk; assuring traceability; and improving social and environmental performance, step by step. Stakeholder Engagement & Supply Chain Risk Assessment Given the number of suppliers Costco has and their geographic dispersion, it is necessary to be strategic and selective with our eorts to mitigate human rights risks while supporting those most vulnerable in our supply chains. Long term (10-30 Years): To capture impacts of chronic physical risks that could potentially develop over time and manifest in our operations and supply chain. We identied that our global supply chain, geograph- ically diverse retail locations, and membership-based model provide risk diversication. Even as to those items, however, the large number of producers in the supply chain limits the scope and frequency of audits that may feasibly be conducted and evaluated. Identify one of our priority commodity supply chains to begin to pilot the TNFD in FY23 and report on progress in December 2024. 3 This risk-based approach is leveraged, in part, by internal expertise from our buying/sourcing, sustainability and compliance teams, as well as by frequent consultation with various external stakeholders who have signicant experience on the ground in supply chains. Extreme variability in weather patterns may disrupt global supply chains by decreasing the production capacity of our suppliers and/or increasing production and transportation costs. This mechanism is based on internationally recognized steps by the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi) to work toward ethical supply chains. In scal year (FY) 2022, 5,305 independent third-party audits were conducted in 87 countries, primarily at the nal manufacturer or processor level of the supply chain. Our action plan consists of ve key components: traceability, supplier engagement, sourcing strategy, partnerships and pilots, and future opportunities. Various screening processes are also applied to the manufacturing entities involved in these supply chains to promote compliance with trade-sanction laws. The primary goal is to leverage the power of the STFs membership to build demand for responsible recruitment practices throughout member supply chains. 2 $75M 2,000 $74.8M $11M Our Supply ChainIn recognition of the importance of respecting human rights in our supply chain, we adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct (the Code).

Strategy, T raining & EducationPartnering with our suppliers to develop their chemical management programs for their supply chain, we provide suppliers with Costco RSLs, Costco Smart Screening results, Good Manufacturing facility audits results and Costco Smart Screening guide to help them source suitable alternative components and materials. Costco shares industry resources with our suppliers via the Costco Smart Screening Guide to help them navigate their chemical management. Supply-chain programs are overseen by the head of Global Sustainability & Compliance, who reports directly to the CEO and regularly engages the executive team and the Board of Directors on our human rights due-diligence eorts. Fair ReturnA fair r eturn in the supply chain is impor tant for Costco to be successful, its suppliers must thrive. These allow suppliers to investigate their supply chains across their operations. Ongoing supplier engagement eorts include: Support suppliers to advance along their sustainability maturity curves with respect to measuring, disclosing, and target-setting for their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. This tool seeks to promote a sense of responsibility and accountability to the supplier and provides a means for annual barn evaluations: Suppliers are r equir ed to audit each house twice a year using the Costco Hen House app platform. The supplier will have items selected to be audited with Costco Smart Screening testing. Develop supplier scorecards and item scorecards to benchmark, celebrate successes, and encourage accountability. 14 Sourcing StrategyWe aim to be thoughtful about how and what we source to ensure we are doing the right thing for our members, our employees, our suppliers, the environment, and the workers and communities in our supply chains. To make sure our suppliers know of all these eorts, we shared the above aggr egate audit results and other updates related to the Code at our annual Supplier Day event in the fall of 2022. This cross-functional approach is also carried forward by various task forces such as our newly established Global Energy Task Force (discussed in our Climate Action Plan), the Merchandising Task Force for Supplier Engagement, and ESG Reporting. DNA testing is completed in multiple stages of the supply chain. It remains dicult in many supply chains t o obtain veriable certicates or adavits in order to have quantitative metrics regarding the phase-out of routine use of shared use antibiotics. 12 Compliance to these standards promotes ethical sourcing of down and feathers through the verication of supplier traceability systems, general animal welfare, risk assessment and other important best practices. Through a patented technology, a program to test the traceability of cotton ber through the entire supply chain has been established. 9 *According to supplier reports Laying HensCostco has introduced the Costco Hen House Audit in the U.

Farms GPS polygon mapped to reduce risk of deforestation with a goal of 100%.","Our goal is to help provide a net positive impact for communities in commodity-producing areas by doing our part to help reduce the loss of natural forests and other natural ecosystems, which include native and/or intact grasslands, peatlands, savannahs and wetlands. Keeping the NGP as grasslands not only helps conserve biodiversity, but it also means cleaner streams, less fertilizer runo, more pollinators for plants and more carbon stored in the soil. These natural ecosystems provide high environmental and social value, including habitat for diverse animal species, carbon sinks and long-term livelihoods for people living in and near these forests. Good land stewardship practices include, but are not limited to: Avoiding deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems. Irrigation practices that limit erosion, and uncultivated buer strips t o further protect water habitats. These certications help to ensure that the needs of the forest ecosystems and their communities are balanced with conservation.

Protecting High Conservation Value (HCV) and High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests. S., where the intact grasslands ecosystem is compatible with responsible cattle grazing. Fishing operations must maintain the structure, productivity, function and diversity of the marine ecosystem. New Approaches in LandscapingLandscaping around our facilities is important for the beauty it provides, and for preserving natural habitat. The shery also needs additional data on how shing interacts with other species including endangered sea turtles and sharks. As we plan new buildings, we are mindful of wetlands and habitats, and preserve natural wonders in designing our landscaping. They also apply to environmental protections, applying to things such as new plantings on peatlands, burning forests and clearing new areas. Natural Preservation Natural preservation of natural wonders or indigenous lands is also important to Costco and our landscaping designs try to take this into account. Costco aims not to sell any seafood species, either branded and Kirkland Signature, that are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) endangered or critically endangered lists and/or CITES Appendix I or II, unless sourced from MSC sheries. More information about Costcos deforestation goals can be found on the Environmental Impacts & Land Stewardship page in our Merchandising section . This is done to ensure the farms are not located in protected forests, and to help preserve these forests from any further encroachment. Virgin-wood bers should come from certied, well-managed forests that dont contribute to deforestation or degradation. 4 Canned TunaSuppliers of Kirkland Signature Albacore Canned Tuna are participants in the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF), which is undertaking science-based initiatives for the long-term conservation and sustainable use of tuna stocks, reducing bycatch and promoting ecosystem health. S. Critical issues that faced the shery before the FIP was developed in 2012 included lack of new or improved data on stock status, bycatch and habitat impacts from lobster traps. Together Costco and the Tsuu TIna worked on blending the building into its environment, using only native plant and tree species in its landscaping to reect the heritage of the plains. 1 Beef and Preserving Native Grasslands Costco recognizes that one of the greatest threats to native grasslands or prairies is conversion to cropland. 10 Design & Site SelectionWe understand the importance of the built environment and the locations we choose to build our warehouses, depots and manufacturing facilities on our carbon footprint and the natural environment. These programs can save us money in landscaping costs and eliminate the use of herbicides to kill unwanted and invasive vegetation. Farms GPS polygon mapped to reduce risk of deforestation with a goal of 100%. We strongly encourage our suppliers to follow the principles of regenerative agriculture, which include practices that minimize soil disturbance, increase plant diversity, keep living roots in the ground year-round, keep soils covered and integrate animals back onto the land. Protect our marine, coastal and freshwater ecosystems and limit the environmental impact associated with aquaculture and shing practices. Costco supports eorts to eliminate deforestation in cocoa production. Value is restated due to an expansion of scope to cover all farmed species. S. Critical issues challenging this shery include the high number of unlicensed vessels in the shery, and lack of eective national and international management of mahi mahi, a highly migratory species. The Bee and Buttery Habitat Fund establishes high-quality pollinator habitat to ensure honeybee and monarch buttery population health. Responsible grazing maintains the health of grasslands, improves soil quality with manure, and preserves open space and wildlife habitat.

Packaging,"Costco recognizes and accepts certain third-party certications into its Smart Screening program, which aim to provide safe, traceable and sustainable products. We believe that our most impactful rst steps are to source our wood, paper and ber-based products from responsibly managed and certied forests, and use recycled content and alt ernative bers when feasible.Costco is exploring in-country production of some of its high volume Kirkland Signature items. Our goal is for our suppliers to create wood, paper and ber-based products with as little impact to the ecosystem as possible while still delivering the quality and price that our members demand.","Some examples of other third-party certication programs include: The Blue Way by BLUESIGN represents the vision and mindset of responsible and sustainable manufacturing of textile consumer products. 2 Textiles The largest category of products in the Costco Smart Screening Program is textiles. These include optimizing packaging design and pallet conguration resulting in more products on a pallet, while striving to reduce packaging, protect goods and reduce delivery trucks on the road. 2 Innovation & Kirkland Signature In order to secure long term-supply, ensure quality products, create eciencies and eliminate unnecessary costs, Costco has been exploring vertical integration and in-country processing of some key Kirkland Signature items. While we desire all products to be sourced this way and encourage our suppliers to follow this goal, we have focused our eorts on our Kirkland Signature products. With Kirkland Signature, were able to meet that mission in an exciting range of products. Costco recognizes and accepts certain third-party certications into its Smart Screening program, which aim to provide safe, traceable and sustainable products. We believe that our most impactful rst steps are to (1) source our wood, paper and ber-based products from responsibly managed and certied forests, and (2) use recycled content and alt ernative bers when feasible. In FY21 and FY22, due to increased demand for ecommerce products and supply constraints, we had to supplement some boxes that did not utilize 100% recycled content. Through various processes we aim to deliver products that are safer, healthier and more sustainable. A major focus for us is to bring more recycled content into packaging, especially with Kirkland Signature products, where we have the most inuence. The program in Cote dIvoire is designed to provide a quality product that is traceable, improves pr ots and livelihoods for the farmers/cooper ative members, and introduces respectful environmental practices. Our buyers work closely with qualied suppliers to get their products into Costco. We also work with chemical and consumer product industries to increase our understanding and to nd more environmentally friendly alternatives for chemicals and practices of concern. We now have over 350 products labeled with the How2Recycle system. Over the past several years, we have incorporated recycled content1 in all materials, paper, metal, plastic and glass, in over 350 Kirkland Signature product packages.

The Kirkland Signature ConceptCostcos mission is to continually provide our members with the best quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices. 2 Updated Dec 2022Wood, Pulp & Paper Our goal is for our suppliers to create wood, paper and ber-based products with as little impact to the ecosystem as possible while still delivering the quality and price that our members demand. In-Country Production In order to reduce ocean freight and transportation emissions, lower costs while retaining product quality, and increase the shelf life of food items, Costco is now exploring in-country production of some of its high volume Kirkland Signature items. This section explains our steps toward packaging sustainability. Costco has expanded FSC certication to other species of solid wood products, including FSC-certied cedar wood playsets, gazebos, outdoor furniture and pavilions. The GOTS system certies the product throughout the entire textile supply chain, ensuring the organic status of cotton from raw materials to the end consumer. Value provided to consumers through volume purchases and ecient distribution may allow Costco t o gain market share for sustainable and low-carbon items. The packaging has evolved over time to become more sustainable as follows: The top of the pepper grinder is r emovable to allow the grinder to be r elled and reused. Widely recyclable packaging is dependent upon the availability of needed materials from recycling streams, which are inconsistent. Costco works directly with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to support the following FIPs: Spiny Lobster - Honduras (For more information ) Spiny L obster - Nicaragua - Entered MSC full assessment process in September 2022 Spiny L obster - Brazil Spiny L obster - Belize Mahi Mahi - Ecuador Mahi Mahi - P eru Mahi Mahi - T aiwan Mahi Mahi and Y ellown Tuna - Costa Rica T una and Swordsh - Sri Lanka Cor vina - Suriname Costco and its suppliers also purchase products from these FIP sheries. Medium-term Market Merchandising may become more dicult, as widely varying regulations may increase pr oduction costs throughout our supply chain, creating challenges to source products or categories at typical pricing. Pasha Hawaii is the principal carrier of Costco products from the mainland to Hawaii. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the Safer Choice label to identify products made with safer ingredients for the health of families, pets, workplaces and the environment. Fiber products ar e not innitely recyclable after about seven times they degrade, lose their strength and are no longer usable. We believe that our most impactful rst steps to help support good forest stewardship practices and to protect forests are to (1) source our wood, paper and ber-based products from responsibly managed and certied forests; and (2) use recycled content and/or alternative bers when feasible. The program covers Kirkland Signature apparel and home textile products. As a result, there is less load on the refrigeration system with improved product temperature maintenance."

Based on our current assessment we foresee our identied climate-related risks outweighing our climate-related opportunities. Processes for managing climate-related risks We will continue to solicit input from global leaders across the company to assess climate-related risks (as well as opportunities) and generate options for managing those risks. 6 Metrics & TargetsMetrics to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with our strategy and risk management process, including Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions and related risks and targets to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and related performance Our Climate Action Plan features an in-depth discussion of climate-related Reduction Commitments, Metrics and Targets. We identied and qualitatively assessed potential impact and likelihood of climate-related risks that impact the Food & Beverage and Multiline retail industries as a whole and those that may uniquely impact Costcos membership warehouse business model. 5 Risk ManagementProcesses for identifying and assessing climate-related risks We have engaged third-party consultants to assist with risk assessment. The ESG Executive Advisory Council which is supported by cross-functional operating teams will be key for identication, assessment and management of climate-related risk. Any material climate-related risks identied will be communicated to the Executive Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors for evaluation. Climate-related risks and opportunities identied over the short, medium and long term In identifying our time horizons for the short, medium and long term, we consider our overall business model, identied risks and general timing of chronic climate-related impacts to be realized: Short term (1-5 Years): Generally aligned with our timeframe for internal nancial planning, budgeting and analysis. The viability of our Climate Action Plan depends upon many external factors that may be dir ectly or indir ectly beyond our control and include: our suppliers ability to meet our expectations; socio-economic and public health risks; the direct and indirect impacts of global climate change on our operations and global value chain; changes in the international and national policy and regulatory landscape, permitting requirements, the availability of refrigerant equipment and low-GWP refrigerant alternatives, the availability of qualied refrigerant and HVAC service providers, requisite supply of clean energy. Meaningful climate action is a central pillar in that work. Using an exploratory approach, we leveraged three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes (IPCC) Sixth Assessment (2021-22), in alignment to the IPCCs temperature- based Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), we identied potential impacts under the following scenarios: a coordinated global action achieves average warming of well below 2.0C; a 2.0-3.0C warming, with a fragmented global geopolitical and commercial response to climate change; an average warming exceeding 3.0C, characterized by a reactive, sporadic global response to mitigate and adapt to the worst eects of climate change.
