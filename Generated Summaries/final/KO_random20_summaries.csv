Human Capital Development,"This is our fourth annual Business & ESG Report, which combines financial data and sustainability progress and performance in one publication. This report provides practical application for businesses on how to integrate climate resilience into their water stewardship strategies. In line with our net zero ambition, we conducted preliminary modeling in 2021 that will enable us to define the key actions and goals needed for a net zero transition by 2050.The Coca-Cola Company's ESG goals are pursued through a concerted effort by the company and its bottling partners in more than 200 countries and territories. The company held an ESG investor event in 2021 to showcase its work and partnerships across a variety of ESG areas.Our ESG initiatives are interconnected, and so are the solutions we support. We are also sharing the outputs of our work on climate resilience with peer companies. It is also foundational to how we evolve and report on our business.","This strong performance heading into 2022 is indicative of the companys resilience, laying the groundwork for continued success and growth. We have been driving several initiatives to help small- scale sugar cane and fruit farmers improve productivity, increase profitability and become more resilient. We have a responsibility to reduce the carbon footprint of our value chain; to improve business resilience by managing short- and long-term risks and impacts of a changing climate; and to foster partnerships that drive positive change. As founding members of the BSR Climate Risk to Resilience platform, we helped shape the development of resilience metrics and risk planning tools as well as the report Rising to Resilience (produced in collaboration with WWF and published in November 2020). Our systems strength and resilience have helped us adapt while remaining true to our purpose: to refresh the world and make a difference. This will be a critical tool for strategic planning and implementing resilience plans. The principles are designed to help farms become more productive, resilient, transparent and compliant.

Were reducing our carbon footprint by lightweighting our packaging, incorporating more recycled and renewable material, investing in local recycling programs and increasing our use of reusable packaging. We made important decisions about streamlining our brand portfolio; changing the way we work as an organization; and tailoring our investments to target the most promising products and priorities. This innovative solution which the Ellen MacArthur Foundation recognizes as a great example of reusable packaging, aligned with its vision for a circular economy for plastics drives efficiency of collection, cleaning and filling by offering multiple sparkling and still brands in the same reusable bottle. Most recently, we announced a global, and industry-leading, reusable packaging goal. 32 In 2022, we announced a new global reusable packaging goal. 8 Material generated by households or facilities in their role as end-users of a product which can no longer be used for its initial intended purpose.

Our finished product operations consist primarily of company-owned bottling, sales and distribution operations. Since labels have to be removed prior to recycling in these markets, these innovations make our packaging easier to recycle. Recycling and Reuse of Plastic The role of government regulation in creating a circular economy for our packaging materials is essential to ensure that societies can move from a linear to a circular operating modelone where materials stay in the economy for reuse and recycling and out of the environment. In Australia, we teamed up with Planet Ark during National Recycling Week to help educate consumers on recycling including what to recycle, how to recycle and where to recycle. Help Us Recycle In Belgium and The Netherlands, we launched the Help Us Recycle campaign, designed to raise awareness of recycling and motivate consumers to pitch in. The consortium has expanded its work to advance reuse and refill packaging models, strengthen recycling and composting infrastructure and recovery pathways, and scale foodservice packaging innovation. Weve also set new targets, including a virgin plastic reduction goal and an industry-leading goal to significantly boost our use of reusable packaging. In addition, suppliers of global priority ingredients are required to provide annual letters of attestation detailing the percentage of volume of ingredients sold to us that comply with our PSA. We have made significant progress with our suppliers to validate or verify the farms where our ingredients are grown. Recycle Me Again Consumers play an important role in achieving a circular economy. We are currently in the process of mapping the volume of the 12 global priority ingredients we procure against this framework. We are currently in the process of mapping the volume of the 12 global priority ingredients we procure against the PSA framework. For example, ReciVeci developed a mobile app to increase the recovery of recyclable and returnable materials in Ecuador and RecyclePoints in Nigeria incentivizes people to recycle PET bottles and other materials through points that can be redeemed for cash and household goods. New innovations, such as the products shown here, are designed with scalability in mind to have staying power across markets and to support our growth. 2 Includes select primary consumer packaging materials. 3 Includes select primary consumer packaging materials. Liters of product produced include all production, not just saleable products. Actions we take to improve overall watershed health in priority sourcing regions where our global priority ingredients are grown. Refer to TCCC 2021 10-K for additional information regarding the 2021 measured unit cases.6 Primary consumer packaging represents that in direct contact with the product itself. 4 In 2019, we modified the methodology we use for calculating the amount of recycled material used in our Primary Consumer Packaging. To support governments in the evolution toward better recycling outcomes, we work with them as well as with trade associations to provide evidence of the safety and quality of recycled materials, which in turn leads to increased take-up of recycled materials. Together, were focusing on what we do bestbuilding brands and products that people love and enjoy, and growing markets for those brands. This is because The Coca-Cola Company buys our ingredients from suppliers that purchase agricultural raw materials directly from farms or through intermediaries. Our vision is for packaging to be reused and recycled as part of a circular economy which means a world with dramatically lower carbon emissions and climate impacts. The pilot supports our ongoing efforts to provide people with the brands they love with less packaging. 1 Only recyclable where infrastructure exists 2 Includes select primary consumer packaging materials. 4 We anticipate resumption of data reporting for individual priority ingredients in the 2022 Business & ESG Report. Our objective is simple: Every day, the people who make and distribute our products should leave work as healthy and as safe as when they arrived. 2 This bar graph shows progress towards total sustainable sourcing of all 12 global priority ingredients, combined, using third- party validation programs approved under our PSA, effective 2021, alongside progress against our previous SAGP, effective 2013-2020. This strategy includes more plant-based packaging that requires less petroleum-based virgin plastic; lightweighting our packaging; using more reusable packaging (both traditional refillables as well as fountain and Coca-Cola Freestyle dispensed solutions), using more recycled material; and recycling more bottles and cans.

Water Related Risks,"The Coca-Cola Company's 2030 Water Security Strategy outlines a vision of increasing water security for our operations, watersheds and communities. In 2021, we returned 167% of the water used in our finished beverages to nature and communities . We have, therefore, integrated ingredient sourcing into our water security vision by unifying our water and sustainable agriculture strategies.Regenerative Water Use is part of Total Beverage Company's 2030 Water Security Strategy. Regenerative water use targets include 100% regenerative use in all Leadership Locations and advanced water efficiency improvements in water-stressed contexts.","These initiatives have resulted in an approximately 2% reduction in water use between December 2020 and December 2021, which is contributing to decreased stress on local freshwater sources and reduced operational costs. Water security is defined as the availability of a sufficient quantity and quality of water, access to safe water services and effective governance of shared water resources. Water stress measures the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies. CONTRIBUTING LOCATIONS: system facility locations in areas with potential low water-related risks yet will contribute to water security overall by meeting 100% compliance with global Coca-Cola Company water stewardship requirements.

All our system production operations around the world will continue to adopt and implement our new Coca-Cola system Water Resource Sustainability Standard, which is aligned with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) principles. As we explore ways to address water use in our agriculture supply chain, we are focusing on two main tracks, similar to the approach we have taken for operational water use in our production facilities: Actions we take to promote advanced water management practices for our global priority ingredients grown in water-stressed regions. Collaboration and Collective Action 2030 Water Resources Group , hosted by the World Bank Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) CEO Water Mandate, a partnership between the UN Global Compact and the Pacific Institute Global Water Challenge Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) The Nature Conservancy The Water Resilience Coalition, an initiative of the CEO Water Mandate WASH4Work, an initiative hosted by the CEO Water Mandate World Wildlife Fund (WWF) The Coca-Cola Companys ongoing commitment to managing water risks sets an example to the industry on the type of work we need to see more of in corporate America. For some, water availability may be the primary risk; for others, it might be water quality, water access, soil health or forest fires, to name a few. The shared nature of water resources requires collective action to remediate water challenges. Promote advanced water management practices for our global priority ingredients grown in water- stressed regions. CASE STUDY The Water-Agriculture Connection Our comprehensive enterprise Water Footprint assessment showed that 73% of our companys total water footprint and 92% of our freshwater footprint is from growing the ingredients needed for our beverages. Water Leadership Our 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing water security through a context-based approach to water replenishment, advocacy for smart water policies and responsible water use across our operations and supply chain. Kirsten James Senior Program Director, Water, Ceres Pillar 3 Our Watersheds WATER GOVERNANCE Addressing water issues is a crucial part of our holistic ESG strategy, which is overseen by the Board of Directors. Through the 2030 Water Security Strategy we announced in 2021, were focused on achieving water security where the company operates and sources ingredients, concentrating on water-stressed areaswhile maintaining 100% replenishment globally. Our 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing water security through a context-based approach to water replenishment, advocacy for smart water policies and responsible water use across our operations and supply chain. Total water used is the total of all water used by TCCS in all global production facilities and co-located distribution centers, from all sources, including municipal, well and spring, surface, sea, and collected rain. In 2022, TCCC expects to report on water replenished in accordance with its 2030 Water Security Strategy. And local businesses, including our bottling partner, were encouraged to reduce their water use and improve their treatment of wastewater. 1 Leadership Locations are to achieve 100% regenerative water use by 2030.Defining Regenerative Water Use Regenerative is our new integrated metric reflecting the concept of circularity in using water in our operations.

Supplier Engagement and Validation To make the biggest impacts, we aim to collaborate with suppliers to engage the farmers in their supply chains to help them improve performance. This allows us to better understand our supply chain and more accurately track the emissions reductions of specific suppliers in key areas of our supply chain. Alongside our Project Last Mile partners, we have used our supply chain, distribution and marketing expertise to support vaccine rollout in a number of African markets, as well as leveraging our network of cold-chain partners. IMPROVER LEVEL, which applies when the supply volume is sourced from smallholder/small-scale producers participating in a support program and continuously improving practices to address their priority sustainability issues over time. As of the end of 2021, 95% of our own operations, 93% of system bottlers and 92% of our Tier 1 suppliers complied with our rigorous Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP) protocols. We have also worked to extend our supplier due diligence beyond Tier 1. Across our supply chain, we have committed to step up spending with Black- owned enterprises by at least $500 million cumulatively by 2025. We also continue to be actively involved with SAI Platforms work on Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA), which helps drive relevant and demonstrable continuous improvement of on-farm environmental, social and economic performance through supply chain collaboration and fostering a common understanding of sustainable agriculture. In 2021 we saw a threefold increase in the number of supplier responses compared to the previous year. We recognize, however, that sustainable agriculture is not a fixed destination but a long-term process that requires ongoing engagement between our business and our supply chains. In some cases, the supplier-provided percentages for the year are primary data; in other cases, the percentages are estimated or based on supplier-provided country or industry averages. 1 Data is based on supplier reporting according to our requirements, which is consolidated and internally validated. A significant amount of our impact is in our supply chain, so we encourage suppliersrepresenting approximately 80% of spend across most major procurement categoriesto respond to the CDP Supply Chain Climate Change questionnaire. In 2021, we requested 442 suppliers (up from 149 in 2020) to disclose, and 75% of these suppliers responded. This is an acknowledgement of our efforts to measure and reduce climate risks within our supply chain. These categories are: LEADER LEVEL, which means that the supply volume is verified to a TCCC approved, third-party validation aligned with the PSA.1 MOVER LEVEL, which means that the supply volume is sourced from farms using other agricultural farming standard(s), effectively identifying and addressing key sustainability issues and advancing sustainable practices. Supplier Engagement Is Key to Transition Because approximately 85% of our total carbon emissions come from things we buy, and not what we do in our direct operations, engaging with suppliers is critical to achieving our science-based target. 2.0% of operating income invested back into local communities from The Coca-Cola Company and The Coca-Cola Foundation in 2021well above our annual goal of 1%1Executive Summary The Coca-Cola Company 2021 Business & ESG Report 57CEO Message Agriculture Portfolio Data Appendix Our Company People Packaging Frameworks Water Operations Climate Project Last Mile launched in 2010 with a simple premise: How can the private sector, and The Coca-Cola Company in particular, share its supply chain and distribution expertise to help ensure life-saving medicines and health services reach communities that need them mostthose in the so-called last mile. Through our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA)-Supplier Guide, we provide guidance to suppliers on implementation of the PSA. Results can fluctuate due to changes in volumes and sourcing origins while we get new suppliers on board with our requirements. We extend these requirements contractually to suppliers through our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP) and our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), each setting clear and strict requirements for human rights. This mapping will form the basis for how we engage with suppliers to drive continuous improvement in line with our Leader-Mover-Improver framework. 1 As of 2021, we are aligning our reported spending metrics with the Roundtables criteria by only including Tier 1 supplier spending. As of the end of 2021, 95% of our own operations, 93% of system bottlers and 92% of our Tier 1 suppliers complied with our rigorous SGP protocols. We are proud to have been recognized by CDP as a 2021 Supplier Engagement leader for the third year in a row. Strategies employed against these priority issues are designed to build business resilience and adaptation to current and future disruptions to operations, supply chain and communities in which we operate.
