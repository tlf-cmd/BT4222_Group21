We have several processes that help us proactively identify, assess and prepare for potential climate-related risks, including a formal enterprise risk management program, processes to monitor domestic and international regulatory developments and a comprehensive business continuity planning framework and program. Our Board of Directors oversees Verizons strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities directly and through its committees. Verizon has also published a standalone TCFD report , which provides more information on how we address climate-related risks and opportunities. Our annual Business Impact Analysis (BIA) assessment identifies, reviews and prioritizes threats to our employees, network and business operations based on known and predicted events, including five climate-related events: storm surge from hurricanes, flooding, wildfire, high straight-line wind and tornadoes. 16 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Environmental In this section: Climate goals .  18 TCFD summary .  19 Our path to operational net zero .  20 Improving energy efficiency .  20 Transitioning to renewable energy .  22 Green financing .  23 Verizons emissions profile .  24 Helping customers reduce their emissions .  25 Reducing our environmental impacts .  26 Reducing waste .  26 Responsibly managing natural resources .  27 Environment, health and safety management .  28 Network reliability and resilience .  29 Network reliability .  29 Infrastructure resilience .  29 Business continuity and event management .  30 Disaster response .  30 17 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Climate goals We recognize that climate change poses a serious threat to society and may impact how we operate our business and networks both today and in the future.

This reports content is grounded in our ESG impact assessment and has been informed by the SASB Standards, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The program launched in 2021 with a focus on climate justice and continued in 2022 with a focus on disability innovation. We established the Climate Resilience Prize to help scale proven, in-market solutions that are focused on mitigating the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities. To integrate climate awareness across the enterprise, Verizons short-term incentive compensation plan for management employees has included a performance measure related to carbon intensity reduction since 2014. The Strategic Leadership and Responsible Business Councils are instrumental to the integration of sustainability considerations into our overall strategy and business operations, overseeing the establishment and execution of our climate-related and social impact goals. Upgrading and hardening our infrastructure to be prepared for a changing climate. Using geospatial analysis, we overlay longterm climate projections from third-party sources onto our current and future operational and network models. 6 In addition to contributing to the achievement of our climate-related goals, our on-site solar installations are a powerful signal to our employees and communities of Verizons dedication to sustainability. With Citizen Verizon, we are leveraging our technology, innovation and people to make the world a better place, focusing on three key areas where we believe we can have the greatest impact: digital inclusion, climate protection and human prosperity. We also provided unlimited data, calling and texting to consumer and small business customers in South Carolina and Florida impacted by the storm. The GEMC uses Verizons in-house weather monitoring platform that leverages multiple sources of weather data to identify potential impact areas and conduct automated pre-storm risk reduction activities. In the case of damaged fiber due to severe weather events, we deploy satellite and microwave links to serve as alternative paths while the original infrastructure is repaired or replaced.

For more information about our efforts to achieve net zero emissions in our operations by 2035 and our investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives, see Our path to operational net zero . Since 2013, we have installed 37.6 megawatts (MW) of on-site green energy generation currently in operation at our facilities. As it is not feasible to power our network operations directly from solar or wind generation facilities during every hour of every day, we are dependent on sourcing power from our nations electrical grids. We are entering into long-term virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for solar and wind power under development that will bring additional renewable energy to our local electrical grids. S., with ~3.3 gigawatts of anticipated renewable energy under contract as of February 10, 2023. In 2022, Verizons solutions helped our customers reduce their energy consumption, enabling the avoidance of over 15.2 million metric tons of CO 2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions, equivalent to taking nearly 3.3 million cars off the road for one year. 4 Network cooling We implement a variety of interventions targeting network cooling to further maximize energy efficiency. 23 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizons emissions profile Verizon has voluntarily disclosed the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our operational energy consumption (scope 1 and 2) since 2004. As of February 10, 2023, Verizon has in place 26 long-term VPPAs for a total of approximately 3.3 gigawatts (GW) of anticipated renewable energy capacity. We are one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy in the U. As we work to reduce our scope 3 GHG emissions, Verizon is partnering with organizations like the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and EcoVadis. The main category is electricity to power our networks and data centers, plus a small amount of steam and heat purchased to heat our buildings. Our fiber-delivered broadband services are at least 100 times more efficient on a kilowatt hour (KwH) per gigabyte basis than copper-delivered broadband services. Transitioning to renewable energy Because the electricity that powers our networks is responsible for most of Verizons emissions, our support of renewable energy and the transition to a greener grid is a key enabler to achieving our 2035 operational net zero goal. Total energy consumed is calculated based on emissions sources included in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, namely natural gas, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, propane, kerosene, compressed natural gas, B02, B05, B11, B20, E85, methanol, ethanol, electricity, steam and chilled water. Thats why we have invested in several community solar programs in Massachusetts and New York that will deliver renewable power to local residents who otherwise could not access clean energy. Verizon Connects solutions for managing fleet EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs help our customers improve fleet operations and reduce fuel consumption."
