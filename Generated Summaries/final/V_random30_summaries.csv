Apex Companies , LLC (Apex) was engaged to conduct an independent verification of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported by VISA U. We use international standards, including the GHG Protocol, to measure and report GHG emissions associated primarily with our energy usage, business travel and employee commuting. Visa is responding by taking serious action to reduce GHG emissions, including achieving carbon neutrality across our operations for the first time in 2020. Apex s sole responsibility was to provide independent verification on the accuracy of the GHG emissions reported, and on the underlying systems and processes used to coll ect, a nalyze and rev iew the inform ation. It is our opinion that VISA has established appropriate system s for the collection, aggregation and analysis of quantitative data for determination of the se GHG emissions for t he stated period and bou ndaries. In 20 21, we used approximately 646,000 gigajoules (GJ) of energy from electricity, natural gas and other fuels an eight percent decrease in consumption compar ed to 2020. We also work with a third party to assure the following data: scope 1, scope 2 and select scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. The determination of the GHG emissions is the sole responsibility of VISA.

Our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, measured in absolute terms with a market-based approach, were 4,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) in 2021. Verification Opinion: Base d on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the GHG emissions stateme nt shown above: x is not ma terially co rrect and is not a fair representation of the GHG emission s data and information; and x has not been prepared in accordance with the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 1 and 2 ), and W RI/WBCSD Green house Gas P rotocol Cor porate Value Chain Accoun ting and Reporting Stand ard (Scope 3). This achievement, which includes the footprint from our scope 1, scope 2 and the employee commuting/business travel components o f scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, is the result of ongoing energy efficiency initiatives, our transition to 100 percent renewable electricity and limited use of carbon offsets to cover our residual footprint.

Visa addresses the remainder of our renewable energy requirements through utility partnerships and the purchase of certified renewable energy certificates (RECs) across over 30 different markets. Visa also continues to champion the overall corporate renewable energy movement, including through our membership in the RE100 and support of the Clean Energy Buyers Association. VISA is respon sible for the prep aration and f air pr esentation of the GHG statement in accord ance with the criteria. This demonstrates that Visa is evolving our approach to renewable electricity procurement to help ensure that our purchases support renewable electricity generation in the areas where we operate.

Specifically, we are using the green bond, due in 2027, to finance green building projects, energy and water efficiency improvements, expanded use of renewable energy, clean transportation, employee commuter programs, environmentally-friendly technologies and initiatives focused on sustainable consumer behaviors. Our energy and GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party. Metrics & Targets In 2021, we formally submitted near-term GHG reduction targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We have further developed our approach to 100% renewable electricity to focus on renewable electricity procurement options at our largest facilities and data centers, such as utility and renewable programs, and to rely less on unbundled renewable energy certificates. Visas net zero by 2040 goal is aligned with global standards and definitions and will include efforts with suppliers to abate a significant portion of the greenhouse gas footprint of the Companys purchased goods and services. Our energy intensity per square foot, a commonly used metric that adjusts for growth, improved by 10 percent year-over-year , the seventh consecutive year of improvement. Apex is respons ible for expressing an opinion on the GHG statement based on the verification. The 2021 GHG Verification Statement is publicly av ailable on our website and included in the Appendix of this report. 2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 36 Renewable Electricity Visa continues to meet our goal (first announced in 2018) of purchasing 100 percent renewable electricity for our offices and data centers through participation in utility renewable energy programs and through the purchase of renewable energy certificates. We focus our efforts on delivering on our corporate climate-focused goals and aspirations: Carbon neutral operations Maintain carbon neutrality of our operations (greenhouse gas emissions scopes 1 and 2 as well as the business travel and employee commuting components of scope 3). 2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 38 Energy & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Around the world, momentum continues to accelerate behind the need to take urgent action on climate change and transition to a low-carbon economy. While we have achieved our goal of purchasing 100 percent renewable electricity, our multi-year approach remains focused on identifying opportunities to expand investments and/or enrollments in renewable electricity offerings, including through long-term renewable electricity purchase agreements, and reduce our purchase of unbundled RECs. We have also piloted and evaluated innovations like direct expansion, dry mode cooling and immersion cooling to improve our energy and/or water efficiency.
