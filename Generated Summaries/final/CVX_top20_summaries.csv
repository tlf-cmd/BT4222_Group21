The model does not adjust for the energy efficiency gains associated with some applications of electricity and hydrogen relative to existing hydrocarbon infrastructure. Where appropriate, energy efficiency factors are used to calculate the volumes of displaced fossil fuels. 22 Total Energy Consumption includes energy generated from Chevrons operations and imported energy. In addition, for Chevron, lower carbon energy includes a variety of existing and emerging energy solutions and services, including traditional energy sources linked with renewables or abatement technologies or measures, carbon capture and sequestration, offsets, blue and green hydrogen, geothermal, and nuclear. 23 Manufacturing Energy Index (MEI) (Refining) is an analysis of Chevrons refining energy performance based on the Solomon Energy Intensity Index methodology. For example, CARB estimates that energy provided as electricity to an electric vehicle is 3.4 times more efficient than energy provided by gasoline to an internal combustion engine. The Solar One project generates 10.5 megawatts of renewable energy annually, enough to power 3,900 U. Exported energy is not subtracted from the total. Our success rests on a culture true to our Chevron Way values getting results the right way.message from our chairman and CEO As the global energy system evolves to meet the demands of a growing world, we are focused on delivering affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy. 7 Calculation methods for Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are based on the American Petroleum Institutes Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (2009) or, where relevant, local regulatory reporting methodologies. For reporting, Chevron includes indirect sources of GHG emissions within Scope1 that are outside of the traditional Scope1 definition, such as GHG emissions from processes like drilling and completions, and tolling agreements up to the point of third-party custody transfer of the oil or gas product. For reporting, Chevron includes indirect sources of GHG emissions within Scope1 that are outside of the traditional Scope1 definition such as GHG emissions from processes like drilling and completions, and tolling agreements up to the point of third-party custody transfer of the oil or gas product. Chevron uses the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2015) definition of three scopes to report GHG emissions. Chevron is committed to being good neighbors and providing affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy. Many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of the energy system for years to come and that the energy mix will increasingly include lower carbon intensity sources. Scope2 emissions are accounted for using the market-based approach as described in the World Resources Institutes GHG Protocol Scope2 Guidance (2015), including calculating Scope2 emissions net of contractual instruments such as renewable energy credits (RECs). CCUS: Net GHG removal emissions associated with CCUS represent the volume of emissions that would be permanently sequestered underground or utilized in other products with a deduction for supply chain emissions associated with capture, transport or storage. For example, Chevron discloses GHG emissions data and established carbon intensity reduction targets on an equity basis covering GHG emissions from company-operated and nonoperated joint ven tures. These businesses support Chevrons efforts to reduce GHG emissions and are also expected to become high- growth opportunities with the potential to generate accretive returns. 21 Offsets are credits generated from the avoidance or reduction of GHG emissions or the removal of GHGs from the atmosphere that are purchased or developed and then retired by Chevron, excluding RECs. Our planned GHG reduction projects include opportunities to reduce vent ing, such as a nitrogen blanket system for the tank farm at Tengizchevroil (TCO), and to reduce flaring, which also reduces methane emissions.

Responsible lower carbon energy In collaboration with Pavilion Energy and QatarEnergy, we jointly developed a liquefied natural gas (LNG) carbon- footprinting methodology for delivered cargoes to help advance a standard for GHG product-level accounting. Direct GHG emissions related to production of energy in the form of electricity or steam exported or sold to a third party are included in the reported Scope1 emissions to align with Ipiecas Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry (2020). Affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy is essential to achieving a more prosperous world. An economically efficient approach to GHG abatement An economically efficient approach to GHG abatement is to prioritize efforts that curtail emissions at the lowest cost per tonne, irrespective of the sectors in which those abate ments occur. In line with our approach to provide comparable and transparent data, we developed the portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) methodology to enable the comparison of Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions of companies that may participate in different parts of the value chain. Biofuels, hydrogen and lower carbon power: GHG emissions are calculated based on third-party lifecycle assessments and the energy provided by Chevron in the most recent year. For 20162021, aggregate biofuel volumes used in the PCI calculation are 60,000, 61,000, 62,000, 68,000, 61,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day, respectively. For more than 10years, we have conducted independent third-party assurance of Chevrons GHG emissions. Net GHG removal emissions associated with CCUS and offsets represent the volume of emissions that would be sequestered or utilized in other products. 8 When a nonoperated joint venture (NOJV) provides consolidated emissions data, Chevron seeks to allocate its equity share of those emissions to the most representative scope and GHG based on best available knowledge of the NOJVs operations. GHG emissions associated with CCUS or offset value chains would be netted from the reductions associated with the activity. In 2021, we expanded this assurance to include Chevrons performance data, Scope3 emissions and GHG emissions on an operational- control basis. For all products that a company produces or refines, the PCI methodology uses the companys equity GHG emissions and corresponding GHG intensity. The RCI is throughput-based and includes GHG emissions from Chevrons own refining operations and estimates of emissions associated with third-party processing of imported feedstocks such as hydrogen. for our most recent assurance statements, visit: chevron.com/oemsISOcertification chevron.com/ESGassurance chevron.com/GHGassuranceto create customized charts and tables using our performance data, visit: chevron.com/sustainability/ performance/chart-generator chevron.com/sustainability 60footnotes are on pages 7475equity emissions 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 SASB Ipieca portfolio carbon intensity (grams CO 2e/megajoule)173.8 73.4 72.7 71.4 71.3 CCE4: C4 upstream carbon intensity2CCE4: C4 Oil intensity (kilograms CO 2e/boe) 36.8 37.0 33.3 28.2 28.6 Gas intensity (kilograms CO 2e/boe) 35.0 34.7 30.4 26.8 28.6 Methane intensity (kilograms CO 2e/boe) 3.3 2.8 2.4 2.0 2.1 Flaring intensity (kilograms CO 2e/boe) 7.2 6.3 4.7 3.8 4.3 refining carbon intensity (kilograms CO 2e/boe)334.5 34.9 35.9 38.6 37.9 CCE4: C4 enabled reductions (million tonnes CO 2e)47 6 5 5 17 direct GHG emissions (Scope 1)5,6,7,8 direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) all GHGs (million tonnes CO 2e)63 66 62 54 57CCE4: C1/A1 Upstream all GHGs (million tonnes CO 2e)927 28 27 23 23 EM-EP-110a.1 CCE4: C3 CO 2 (million tonnes) 24 25 24 21 20 CH 4 (million tonnes CH 4)100.12 0.10 0.10 0.08 0.08 CH 4 (million tonnes CO 2e)103.0 2.5 2.4 2.1 2.1 Other GHGs (million tonnes CO 2e) 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Upstream flaring all GHGs (subset of Scope 1) (million tonnes CO 2e)5 5 5 4 4EM-EP-110a.2 CCE7: C4 CO 2 (million tonnes) 5 5 4 3 4 CH 4 (million tonnes CH 4)100.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 CH 4 (million tonnes CO 2e)100.5 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.3 Other GHGs (million tonnes CO 2e) < 0.1 < 0.1 < 0.1 < 0.1 < 0.1 Volume of flares (mmscf) 80,000 70,000 60,000 50,000 50,000 CCE7: A1 Midstream all GHGs (million tonnes CO 2e) 2 2 1 1 1EM-MD-110a.1 CCE4: C3 CO 2 (million tonnes) 2 2 1 1 1 CH 4 (million tonnes CH 4)10< 0.01 < 0.01 < 0.01 < 0.01 < 0.01 CH 4 (million tonnes CO 2e)10< 0.1 < 0.1 < 0.1 < 0.1 < 0.1 Other GHGs (million tonnes CO 2e) < 0.1 < 0.1 < 0.1 < 0.1 < 0.1 Downstream all GHGs (million tonnes CO 2e)1121 20 19 18 20 EM-RM-110a.1 CCE4: C3 CO 2 (million tonnes) 20 20 19 18 19 CH 4 and other GHGs (million tonnes CO 2e) 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) all GHGs (million tonnes CO 2e)7 9 8 7 8EM-EP-110a.2 CCE4: C3 CO 2 (million tonnes) 7 9 8 7 8 CH 4 and other GHGs (million tonnes CO 2e) 0.4 0.5 0.3 0.2 0.3 equity emissions table continues on page 62 chevron.com/sustainability 61equity emissions, cont.

Now at its halfway mark, the MERA program is about to open Jakartas first-ever center for mangrove education to help build public awareness about mangrove ecosystem conservation. This includes the restoration of habitats, ecosystems and ecosystem services. When evaluating whether to operate in protected or ecologically sensitive areas, we consider the characteristics of the area, the type and proximity of the proposed operation, our ability to meet or exceed regulatory requirements, and our capability to avoid or manage potential impacts by using appropriately protective operating practices. The plan also includes the reclamation of 1,471 legacy vertical wells, tank batteries and associated roads in the development area, which is expected to reduce Chevrons surface footprint by 95% when compared to past practices and will return thousands of acres to other uses such as agriculture, rangeland and wildlife habitat. The ERMP also facilitates Chevrons Protective by Design concept, which applies the mitigation hierarchy, to avoid, reduce, restore or offset potential impacts to the environment, including on biodiversity. Wetlands can reduce the impacts of floods, offer notable ecosystem services and improve waterquality.

In 2021, ALNG signed a memorandum of under - standing with Kitabanga Project that included a commitment to fund and monitor the ongoing conservation program. For example, in the East Texas Deadwood Development Area, we use field surveys and Geographic Information System data to plan flowlines and well pad locations that reduce potential impacts within the development area and to plan construction schedules to reduce vegetation removal during the nesting season that potentially could impact migratory birds. Creation of the artificial reefs enabled Chevron not only to reduce asset retirement costs, but also to provide habitat for marine life and recreational diving opportunities, benefiting local fishers and communities and enabling scientists to further study artificial reef science and the value of such infrastructure in the Gulf of Thailand. Colorado Parks and Wildlife designated some of the Mustang area as high-priority habitat for Eastern Plains native fish, nesting areas for hawks and bald eagles, and winter range - land for pronghorn and mule deer. In March 2022, we announced an agreement with Restore the Earth Foun - dation for a reforestation project for up to 8,800 acres of property in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, U. When planning development for the Dagger Lake Development Area in New Mexico, we strategically selected well pad locations that would avoid disturbing a designated habitat area for the lesser prairie chicken while still being able to access oil and natural gas utilizing horizontal drilling. The conservation program started in 2006 with the support of local fishermen and community members, and by the end of 2020, more than 105,000 turtle hatchlings had been released from the hatchery. The project team selected a plan to separate operations on either side of the river that avoids impacting the mussels potential habitat. Chevron is working with Chulalongkorn University in Thailand and Curtin University in Australia to monitor the artificial reef over a three-year period, examining fish, benthic communities, sediment, plankton, and a range of water quality aspects and overall ecosystem value. During construction of the Angola LNG (ALNG) facility, we became aware that Olive Ridley sea turtles had begun using the area as a nesting site. This designation led Chevron to develop the area in a way that avoided identified nesting sites and wetland areas. They are also home to a wide variety of native animals, fish and plants."

These tools support our transportation safety efforts by providing drivers with alternative lower-risk routes. During this time, we have actively addressed evolving issues, updating workforce guidelines to be consistent with the advice of leading public health organizations for providing a safe workplace. We believe the SWCs have contributed to our decreased fatality rate from 2018 to 2021. Monitoring heat stress and heat strain On hot days, workers in outdoor and some indoor settings face an increased risk of incurring heat strain (the overall physiological response to heat stress), which can lead to significant illness and even death. Vanessa Fruge Process Engineer, Pascagoula Refinery employee spotlight During the planning phase for recent turnarounds, I was 28 weeks pregnant, so I went to our local medical clinic to evaluate my fitness for duty because working a turnaround is more physical than a typical day at work. As a founding member of the Permian Road Safety Coalition, we share and advance best practices among the companies operating in the region as well as educate communities on their critical role in road safety. We understand that self-care, mental health and emotional well-being are integral to employee health, safety and productivity. To protect our workforce from heat strain, we are researching and piloting the feasibility of a wearable skin patch that could provide real- time, automated analysis of sweat loss, electrolyte loss, temperature between the skin and clothing, and motion. The program is mobile and on-demand, which fits the needs of our global workforce to help them reduce stress, make healthier life choices and take steps to protect themselves from communicable diseases, including COVID-19. The overall support I received at this time was critical in keeping me safe and healthy during my pregnancy while enabling me to perform typical turnaround tasks. Our industrial hygienist provided me with recommendations to discuss with my doctor and supervisor to help keep me healthy and safe while performing my job responsibilities during the turnaround. Maintaining reliability and integrity The reliability and integrity of our equipment is another important dimension of process safety. 46 Process Safety Tier 1 loss-of-primary-containment (LOPC) events are unplanned or uncontrolled releases resulting in consequences equivalent to those specified by the American National Standards Institute/American Petroleum Institute (ANSI/API) Recommended Practice (RP) 754 and IOGP Report 456: Process Safety Recommended Practice on Key Performance Indicators."
