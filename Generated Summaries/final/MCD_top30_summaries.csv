We are leveraging scenario modeling to u nderstand the transition and physical risks and opportunities for the McDonalds System, including our supply chain, Company offices and Company -owned and franchised restaurants. Prioritizing Ac tion and Engaging Our Supply Chain An important step in our journey was to understand exactly where our sourcing was driving deforestation, and where we could take action to drive the greatest positive impact. Thi s assessment paired McDonalds supply chain data with that of the 11 world regions projected to account for the majority of deforestation globally so that McDonalds could take action to drive the greatest positive impact. Creating Supply Chain Climate Action Str ategies Through our climate data and insights platform, we know which suppliers and food - sourcing categories contribute the most to our emissions. For example, together with our suppliers, we work toward more sustainable agriculture practices, leveraging their insights, expertise and partnerships to drive effective action across the supply chain. As well as target -setting, we have an expectation that suppliers will instigate emi ssions monitoring and reduction programs, and report progress through the CDP Supply Chain program. We plan to expand this work to other commodities beyond 2020, continuing to understand the impacts of our supply chains.

It runs parallel with our supply chain sustainability reporting system and uses common sources of information. This process enabled us to better monitor our beef supply chain and help our suppliers take targete d action. To achieve this, we are partnering with suppliers and producers across our supply chain to drive toward continuous improvement throughout their lives. Our supply chain focus will be on areas including: Farm management On farms, sustainability and efficiency are interconnected; a carbon footprint is an indicator of a farms overall proficiency and therefore its profitability.

In 2019, McDonalds committed to two renewable energy projects in Texas through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs)McDonalds is committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By 2030, we expect to prevent approximately 150 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being released into the atmosphere. This is the equivalent of taking 32 million passenger cars off the road for an entire year. Forests play a vital role in creating oxygen and absorbing GHG emissions.","We achieved an overall reduction in energy consumption of 15%, as measured in 2019 compared to 2011. In 2020, we also unveiled a first -of-its-kind restaurant designed to create enough renewable energy on -site to cover 100% of its own energy needs on a net annual basis. The global flagship restaurant is designed to create enough renewable energy on -site to cover 100% of its annual energy needs, and will serve as a learning hub to test solutions for reducing energy and water use. To advance the overall sustainability of McDonalds restaurants in Europe, we also operate to Green Building Guidelines, which are part of our continuous efforts to reduce energy consumption by sharing best practice and using the la test technologies. In Europe, renewable energy purchases in 2020 covered over 6,000 restaurants worth of electricity across 11 markets (Austria, France, U. Adding Renewable Energy to the Grid In 2019, McDonalds committed to two renewable energy projects in Texas through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs). McDonalds participates on the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA) Board of Directors, collaborating with other energy buyers, energy providers, and serv ice providers to navigate the complexities of the energy market. S. renewable energy projects are online, the energy generated will be equivalent to over 8 ,000 U. 84 Restaurant Energy Usage and Sourcing Together with our Franchisees, w e are working across our restaurants to be more innovative and efficient, with investments in areas such as renewable energy, LED lighting and energy -efficient kitchen equipment. This means minimizing our use of energy and water, and maximizing the use of renewable energy, wherever possible. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic (e.g., partly closed restaurants, fewer guest visits) in 2020, we achieved an overall reduction in energy consumption of 23%. These were a first for the company and helped us join other leading corporate renewable energy buyers in adding new, large - scale, ren ewable energy to the U. Germany We have consistently reduced energy consumptio n through modernization, employee training, energy monitoring and alarms in recent years. Our Global Restaurant Building & Equipment Standa rds include minimum requirements and recommendations on issues such as lighting, refrigeration and the energy efficiency of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, as well as energy management and even the way in which buildings are constructed to optimize solar gain. These markets have achieved purchasing over 75% renewable electricity for their restaurants, and in many cases are at or close to 100% renewable electricity. It features 25 core initiatives to reduce its environmental impact, from energy -efficiency to water conservation to recycling, and is designed to operate with 100% renewable energy and elements like carbon -neutral McDelivery. K. New McDonalds restaurants have 100% LED lighting, which uses 50% less energy than fluorescent lighting. We are members of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Land Based Technical Working Group, which is developing new technical guidance and standards on how companies account for and report emissions, reductions and removals from land use activities in their GHG in ventories. We know that we dont yet have all the answers, but were engaging with expert grou ps, farmers and industry to test and scale more sustainable and regenerative practices that help protect nature, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and secure farmer livelihoods. We know that we dont yet have all the answers, but were engaging with expert groups, farmers and industry to test and scale more sustainable and regenerative practices that help protect nature, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and secure farmer livelihoods. We have been on this journey for a number of years and we are proud that, in 2018, McDonalds became the first global restaurant company to set a science -based target approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reducing GHG emissions in France: We helped to establish project CAP2ER, an environmental footprint calculator that evaluates the environmental impacts within beef farming, helping to identify where farme rs can work to reduce their GHG emissions. By 2030, we expect to prevent approximately 150 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being released into the atmosphere, the equivalent of taking 32 million passenger cars off the road for an entire year. 124 Why It Matters Forests play a vital role in creating oxygen and absorbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These efforts help us reduce GHG emissions and enable u s to progress toward our cl imate commitment. To reinforce the restaurants net zero energy status, we are working towards the International Living Futures Institutes Zero Energy Certification . We support the work of the GWP* Group to examine and model the impa ct and application of the GWP* methodology to reflect the warming impact of methane 89 as a greenhouse gas. McDonalds was the first global restaurant company to set greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative . We support initiatives to help farmer s adopt management practices that improve soil health, and at the same time ensure that farming systems that actively sequester carbon are recognized in GHG measurements. Forests as a Climate Solution We know that corporate accounting and disclosure of GHG emissions from deforestation is a major challenge, and that reporting expectat ions on these emissions will continue to evolve. Through partnership and collaboration with our Franchisees, suppliers and producers, we committed to reduce GHG emissions related to our restaurants and offices by 36% by 2030 from a 2015 base year, as well as a 31% reduction in emissions intensity (per metric ton of food and packaging) across our supply chain. These efforts help us reduce GHG emissions and enable us to progres s toward our climate commitment. We also support the work to define the action of methane more accurately as a greenhouse gas. Ruaraidh Petre, Executive Director, Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) Reducing Emissions In 2018, we became the worlds first restaurant company to set a science -based target to reduce GHG emissions related to McDonalds restaurants, as well as reduce emissions intensity (per metric ton of food and packaging) across our supply chain. For the existing restaurants, McDonalds China has been continuously updating and optimizing the energy management systems, incl uding the use of LED energy -saving lamps, as well as more efficient air conditioning and kitchen equipment. Goal 90 By 2030, partner with Franchisees to reduce GHG emissions related to McDonalds restaurants and offices by 36% from a 2015 base year. As part of the Cool Farm Alliance, we have supported the development of the Cool Farm Tool that provides farmers in multiple countries and farming se ctors with free access to a GHG measurement system, which they can use to assess their carbon footprint. Collabor ating With Stakeholders By collaborating with relevant stakeholders, we can identify and support practices that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, optimize positive impacts and support resilient farms and farmer livelihoods. The design of their global flagship restaurant is another positive step in how McDonalds is tackli ng the climate challenge by bringing proven renewable energy solutions under one roof and educating their customers about the importance of sustainable practices and renewable energy sources. We are also contributing to the d evelopment of GHG accounting methods to demonstrate the impact of factors such as land use change and carbon sequestration to our footprint, to keep our strategy robust and resilient."
Biodiversity,"McDonalds believes that more of our food can be produced in a way that protects the environment and contributes to a thriving global food system. The PECSA program focuses on the recovery of degraded pastures and improvements in animal management, protecting the areas biodivers e ecosystems.McDonalds has played an important role in improving the sustainability of the global whitefish sector. We have teamed up with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Walmart Foundation and Cargill to improve grazing management practices across one million acres of land in the Northern Great Plains.Cattle are a vital part of the ecosystem on the farm, contributing to soil biology. People, plants and animals rely on forests for food, fresh water and shelter. Apex predators, such as jaguars, are a good indication of a robust ecosystem.","We believe that more of our food can be produced in a way that not only protects the environment and contributes positively to a thriving global food system but also helps rehabilitate and enhance ecosystems around farms through better soil health, improved water management and increased biodiversity.

Our volumes of physical certified oils increased from 71.0% in 2019 to 78.1% in 2020.5 Volumes of McDonald's Palm Oil by RSPO Supply Chain Model: 78.1% Physical RSPO Certified o 0.1% Identity Preserved o 7.1% Segregated 137 o 70.9% Mass Balance 21.9% RSPO Book and Claim Credits Coffee 98.3% of coffee sourced for McDonalds restaurants supported deforestation -free supply chains in 2020.6 Fiber 99.6% of primary fiber -based guest packaging sourced for McDonalds restaurants supported deforestation -free supply chains in 2020.7 Our Actions Support of Jaguar Habitats One of the ways McDonalds has expanded its work beyond our initial forest commitment is to engage in efforts to halt conversion of ecosystems that host critical biodiversity, including forests, grasslands and savannahs, such as our support of the Instituto Onca -Pintada in Brazil. That is why weve worked with partners and independent experts for many years, such as the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP), Conservation International and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), to continue identifying ways to improve the health of marine ecosystems. Investing in soil and biodiversity in Nebraska, U. It has been a key focus for our responsible sourcing work since 2011 when we joined the RSPO , and we remain committed to reporting on an annual basis to the RSPO Annual Communication on Progress.3 Fish Thriving marine ecosystems are essential for biodiversity, livelihoods, food security and economies. However, with demand growing, natural forests have been replaced by palm oil plantations, leading to reduced biodiversity, increased carbon dioxide emissions and even the displacement of communities. Through these efforts, weve collaborated with farmers and ranchers who have shown us its possible to produce beef in a way that protects and maintains native landscapes including grasslands, improves biodiversity and sequesters carbon in soils while supporting farmer livelihoods for the long term. S., for example, is looking at how regenerative grazing practices can capture more carbon in the soil and increase biodiversity. We support global efforts to restore depleted fish stocks, improve fishery management and conserve marine environments. To date, more than 20,000 assessments have been carried out, and we have verified that 129,000 hectares of land is being managed to support biodiversity by French beef farmers who we source from. Latest Insights From Rege nerative Farming Pilots The positive environmental impacts of regenerative agricultural practices, such as improving biodiversity and capturing carbon, are demonstrable. Alongside our Latin American Franchisee Arcos Dorados, we provide continuous feedback to the CFAs framework and support solutions that help protect forests and native vegetation in the Amazon, Cerrado and Chaco. This is helping us to identify what benefits the technique can have on the environment and farming communities, such as the potential to improve soil health, sequester more carbon, increase grassland biodiversity and promote farmer livelihoods and animal welfare. 37 Over the years, McDonalds has played an important role in improving the sustainability of the global whitefish sector via the implementation of independently verified criteria around healthy fish stocks, impact of fishing on ecosystems, fisheries management and other key actions. We are also engaged with the Good Growth Partnership , a collaboration between the UN Development Program, the Global Environment Facility, the International Finance 131 Cooperation, WWF and Conservation International, and are leve raging their tools to support the implementation of our Commitment on Forests. Deforestation refers to the loss of natural forest as a result of: i) conversion to agriculture or other non -forest land use; ii) conversion to a plantation forest; or iii) severe and sustained degradation as aligned with the definitions of AFi. For example, we have teamed up with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Walmart Foundation and Cargill to improve grazing management practices across one million acres of land in th e Northern Great Plains o ne of th e las t remaining temperate grasslands in the world. For example, we have teamed up with the World Wildlife Fund, Walmart Found ation (WWF) and Cargill to improve grazing management practices across one million acres of land in the Northern Great Plains one of the last remaining temperate grasslands in the world. 2 Beef Goal 5: Conserve Forests: Definitions: Please refer to Our Conserving Forest Page for definitions. The Certificado Onca -Pintada, or Jaguar Friendly Ranch Certification, by the Instituto Onca -Pintada recognizes accomplishments related to protecting this threatened species. Cargill works with farmers to implement sustainable agricultural prac tices and to protect forests and native vegetation. This gives us an added reason to continue our work to protect biodiversity, to help protect our health i n the future. In this way, were maximizing our impact and addressing deforestation for both beef and soy by reducing pressure on forests from the expansion of agriculture. Download our Forest and Native Vegetation Priority Maps (PDF 3 MB) . Importantly, our commitment extends beyond forests to other areas of high conservation value, to the people and communities around the world who depend on forests. Farm Assessments A farms location may make it a priority, but that does not mean deforestation is happening. Focusing on activity in the soil below t he ground, cattle are a vital part of the ecosystem on the farm, contributing to soil biology with the trampling of grass and addition of dung to feed microbes to create more and better soil. People, plants and animals rely on forests for food, fresh water and shelter, yet they and other high value conservation areas remain under threat. Apex predators, such as jaguars, are a good indication of a robust and thriving ecosystem. Please refer to Our Conserving Forest Page for additional definitions. The GRSB Principles and Criteria are focused on five core themes: Manage natural resources responsibly. In 2014, we signed onto the New York Declaratio n on Forests , a shared commitment to end deforestation by 2030. The UN's Global Forest Goals 2021 Report , states that ""Between 2015 and 2020, deforestation, which measures the conversion of forest to other land use, stood at 10.2 million hectares (ha) per year."" It aims to help eliminate deforestation in the Amazon biome and to meet the GRSB Principles and Criteria. When we fail to protect forests, climate change effects worsen, critical biodiversity is lost and livelihoods and human rights are threatened as are the natural ecosystems that we all rely on for the food we eat. Countries with regions currently identified as high -deforestation priority regions for soy include Argentina (Chaco biome), Brazil (Amazon and Cerrado biomes), and Paraguay (Chaco biome).
