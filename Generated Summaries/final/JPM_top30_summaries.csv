The negative implications from climate change may impact a countrys economic, fiscal, monetary and political frameworks in numerous ways, in turn adversely affecting its sovereign credit ratings. This includes major events and disruptions that impact the Firm and which may be driven by climate change. We use internationally recognized scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to inform our measurement of the potential financial and economic impacts to the Firm from the manifestation of climate risks. A number of climate change risk assessments are now included in the Firms risk inventory, and more will likely continue to be added to it as we evolve and deepen our examination of climate change. For this reason, we continually strive to enhance our climate-related investment capabilities and our efforts to help clients consider the material implications of climate change within their portfolios.

As a global financial institution, our clients, operations and business strategy may be impacted by climate change either from the transition to a low-carbon economy (transition risk) or through the changing climate itself (physical risk). The team is engaging across the Firm to help integrate climate considerations into LOB risk management frameworks. P. Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM), we believe contributing to solutions to tackle climate change creates long-term value for our clients. With respect to climate-related matters, senior managements responsibilities include; consideration and inclusion of climate-related risks into the Firms strategy and operations; and the implementation of strategic climate-related business initiatives, like our work to finance and facilitate more than $1 trillion by the end of 2030 to support climate action and other green initiatives. RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE CLIMATE REPORT REFERENCES OTHER SOURCE REFERENCES GOVERNANCE Boards oversight of climate- related risks and opportunitiesGovernance a. $1 Trillion for Green In 2021, we set a target to finance and facilitate more than $2.5 trillion over 10 years from 2021 through the end of 2030 to advance long-term solutions that address climate change and contribute to sustainable development. We continue to refine our taxonomy based on an evolving understanding of how climate-related risk drivers may manifest as risks to the Firm. Longer-term, chronic and acute impacts from our climate scenarios are being integrated into the existing risk frameworks with the intention of allowing us to consider potential impacts of climate change when developing strategies for our physical footprint and operations. CASE STUDY CASE STUDY 32 33 Similarly, the Firm may engage with industry initiatives to help address complex global challenges, including climate change, where we are aligned with the initiatives goals and can continue to exercise our own business judgment based on the best interest of the Firm. We engage with stakeholders throughout the year to obtain insight into their needs and perspectives, and to gather feedback on our strategy and performance, including as they relate to climate change. In the near term, we are focused on progressing how we consider climate-related risks; collect, analyze and disclose climate-related data; and set, measure and report on our climate-related commitments. CLIMATE RISK The Climate Risk team is responsible for establishing the firmwide framework and strategy for climate risk, developing and advancing climate risk policy and standards, and building our approach to climate risk data. 1 As informed by TCFDs recommendations, this report provides details on: How climate-related risks and opportunities are addressed within our corporate governance practices; How our business is responding to climate risks and opportunities, including our evolving strategies and programs to support the transition to a low-carbon economy; How we identify, assess and manage climate risks within our risk management framework; and How we are measuring our performance and making progress toward our targets, including for our operational emissions and key sectors of our financing portfolio. JPMorgan Chase recognizes that climate risk management is a new and rapidly evolving risk discipline. For example, in 2021 directors were provided with education on the Firms climate risk management framework. Identifying and Integrating Climate-Related Risks (pages 4041; 4553) b. This includes defining oversight and management of climate-related risks and opportunities within and across our LOBs, and integrating them with our firmwide governance framework. Meeting the climate challenge will require developing and deploying new technologies, business models and other solutions throughout the global economy. It is among the prerequisites we view as essential to make the achievement of our and others climate targets feasible. Identifying and Integrating Climate-Related Risks (pages 4042; 4553) b. To guide our efforts, we have developed a set of operational sustainability targets, many of which are focused on reducing our contribution to climate change. 30 31 While we are proud of the steps our Firm has taken to respond to climate-related risks and opportunities in our business, we know we have more work to do, and that we will continue to learn, including from the feedback we receive from stakeholders. In response to climate change, and in support of our clients transitioning to a lower-carbon economy, the Firm may make changes to its business strategy, product offerings and risk profile.

GHG Emissions JPMorgan Chases 2021 operational GHG emissions were driven by two primary activities: powering our buildings (e.g., electricity, heating and cooling) and business travel. This should include minimizing fugitive methane emissions and virtually eliminating wasteful flaring of natural gas. Scope 1 GHG emissions include those from building operations and company-owned aircraft and vehicles. JPMorgan Chase utilizes an operational control approach to establish boundaries for our GHG inventory. OPERATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY The Operational Sustainability team is responsible for the Firms carbon management strategy, including tracking and reporting the Firms GHG emissions and progress toward our operational sustainability targets.

JPMorgan Chase Risk Types Note: Country risk may be a driver of risk, or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as credit or market risk, but is not a JPMorgan Chase risk type. We are working with industry partners and NGOs to help make direct measurement technologies the preferred method of tracking and reporting methane emissions. We are also considering indirect and longer-term risk drivers, including the potential for change in cost or availability of insurance for physical risks in a given geography, permanent loss or structural changes to consumer preferences. S. from 2020 to 2050 under RCP 8.5 46 47 WHOLESALE CREDIT RISK As of December 31, 2021, the Firm had $1.1 trillion of wholesale credit exposure. The Firm has established a stress framework to quantify the impact of the transition risk stress scenarios to vulnerable asset classes. As a result, reported methane emissions rely on estimation methods that are less accurate. As of the end of 2021, we had reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 location-based emissions by 17%. For example, in the Oil & Gas sector, there are inconsistencies in the measurement, management and reporting of data across organizations, as well as the lack of reliable and standardized techniques for measurement in certain areas, such as methane emissions. We are using our resources to better understand how transition and physical risks may manifest and their potential impacts on the existing risk types the Firm manages. For example, we engage with the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership, as part of our broader efforts to explore opportunities for industry clients, technology innovators, and data providers to accelerate direct measurement technologies as a preferred method of tracking and reporting methane emissions.
