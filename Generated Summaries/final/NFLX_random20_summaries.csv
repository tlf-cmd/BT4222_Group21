Released Netflixs first Sustainability Collection of titles in partnership with the COP26 Presidency (the UK government). Our governance structure has been deliberately constructed to help us to do that. SASB guidelines differ depending on the industry. I cannot express how pleased I am to read the press release and see the African countries list from which students can make applications for bursary funding. So we will be topping up our commitment at the end of the year and moving more cash over and above the $100 million already committed into these institutions. In February 2021, we complied with a written demand from the Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to remove the film Gandu in Singapore only. In 2021, the SBTi issued guidance for long-term corporate net zero, and a variety of other net zero guidance initiatives (e.g. Netflix relies on its expert advisory group to provide additional insight and guidance on an ongoing basis across a range of key issues, including our carbon credit portfolio. In June 2021, we complied with a written demand from the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) in Vietnam and removed the series Pine Gap in Vietnam only. Annabel Davis :: CEO, Co-Curious We had a discussion about how important it was to create a possibility for creatives from Africa to receive bursary support to attend institutions like AFDA.

We look for renewable energy options in the following order of preference: onsite solar+storage, utility provided green tariff programs, direct investment or purchase agreements for offsite wind or solar, 4) unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates. We plan to continue using electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2022.Netflix is deploying all-electric passenger vehicles into its production operations. More than 70 vehicles piloted this year, resulting in a fuel reduction of roughly 13,050 gallons of gasoline and 116 MTCO217. Our internal audit team validates our greenhouse gas accounting methodologies.","In 2021, we conducted energy efficiency audits at select facilities to identify opportunities for energy savings through equipment upgrades and better building management practices. 3 While SASB only requires reporting for the Environmental Footprint of Hardware Infrastructure, Netflix has opted to report on its other Scope 2 energy consumption as well, which includes electricity use in corporate offices, production studios, and billboards, in addition to colocation data center infrastructure.4Environmental 1.

Environmental 13Reducing Emissions from Electricity Use First, we optimize by focusing on energy efficiency, reducing the amount of electricity that we use in both our production work and also in our offices. Optimize fuel consumption : For corporate offices, this focuses mostly on efficient creation and capture of building heat, and on the production side, can range from optimizing the size of diesel generators or reducing how long vehicles idle. This was achieved through a range of approaches that include onsite generation, clean supply from electricity service providers and landlords, as well as by purchasing renewable energy attribute certificates. 8 We applied a volume of RECs to Scope 3 emissions where we had information on the specific energy consumption by location (e.g. For example, on the set of Virgin River Season 4, our electric battery pilots reduced generator fuel consumption by about 20%. This analysis covered over 30% of our global square footage across stages, studios, and offices and identified cost-saving energy efficiency opportunities across our facilities. This includes using fossil-fuel generated electricity and the direct combustion of fossil fuels for heating buildings, creating mobile electricity supply (e.g. Procuring Renewable Electricity In 2021, we matched our global operations with 100% renewable electricity, including all offices and self-managed productions. Decarbonize through fuel switching : We recognize that not everything can be solved with efficiency or electrification. Internet Transmission & User Device Energy Use Not included in our Scope 3 boundary are emissions from the internet transmission or electronic devices our members use to watch Netflix, like an Apple tablet, Android phone, or Samsung television. These range from energy efficiency to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). We look for renewable energy options in the following order of preference: 1) onsite solar+storage, 2) utility provided green tariff programs, 3) direct investment or purchase agreements for offsite wind or solar, 4) unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates. For instance, where we can, we use electric motors because theyre more efficient and electricity is more easily decarbonized. Against our 2021 footprint, Netflix retired Energy Attribute Certificates, such as RECs, for electricity use in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, & United States. 4 Netflixs greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting is consistent with the operational control approach as set out by the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard: Revised Edition (2004). This means matching renewable electricity to any grid-connected power that isnt carbon-free and shifting to lower-carbon or zero-carbon fuel options when connecting to the grid isnt possible. OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND BOUNDARIES Our Carbon Footprint - In the past year, we measured our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, also known as carbon footprint, following the GHG Protocol for 20214.

This includes electricity generated by fossil fuels, as well as the direct combustion of fossil fuels to heat buildings, on-set power generators, and for transportation. We present the footprint and our target progress in three separate tables throughout this report: Table 1: 2021 Greenhouse Gas Inventory below shows our 2019, 2020, and 2021, greenhouse gas corporate inventory per the WRI/WBCSD Corporate Greenhouse Gas Accounting Protocol. These were primarily from switching to greener sources of electricity in key markets and conducting pilots of clean and silent mobile power solutions across our productions, as described in the above sections. To be conservative, our calculations do not take account for regions where hourly emissions are lower due to partial or full renewable energy usage from the grid. Netflixs 2021 company carbon footprint by business activity Methodology: How we calculate our footprintAll GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol (Annex A) relevant to Netflix are accounted for and converted into metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MTCO2e) as specified by the GHG Protocol (GHG Protocol, 2004)10. Our Independent Accountants, Ernst & Young (EY), reviewed our 2021 Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions (their report here). Our internal audit team validates our greenhouse gas accounting methodologies and we engage EY to perform limited assurance over our greenhouse gas emissions. 11 The boundary was established in alignment with the GHG Protocol Corporate and Scope 3 Standards. 5 There is no reporting guidance from the SBTi on tracking progress towards science based targets on an annual basis, so we use standard greenhouse gas accounting methodologies per the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 7 This includes categories 1-4, 6-8, and 11, as defined by the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Guidance. Deploying Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Charging Infrastructure In the past year, Netflix productions in Los Angeles, Vancouver and Toronto incorporated all-electric passenger vehicles into their production operations, and increased the number of plug-in hybrid and hybrid vehicles use, totalling more than 70 vehicles piloted this year, resulting in a fuel reduction of roughly 13,050 gallons of gasoline and 116 MTCO217.
