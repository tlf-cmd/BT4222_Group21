We define zero carbon electricity as any type of electricity generation that does not generate GHGs such as solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and large-scale hydropower. For example, Pixar is subscribed to 100% renewable electricity through East Bay Community Energy. As of fiscal 2022, we have commissioned or announced more than 200 megawatts of solar capacity. Reducing emissions through fuel and energy efficiency 3. Disneyland Paris is continuing the construction of approximately 50 acres of solar canopies, which will provide shade and shelter to more than 11,000 parking spaces and are estimated to generate approximately 36 gigawatt hours of electricity once fully operational. Activities identified as downstream transportation and distribution do not result in significant Scope 3 emissions for the Company. The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix for which we do not possess RECs or GOs is not included in this calculation. We define net emissions as follows: Scope 1 emissions + Scope 2 emissions (market-based) carbon credits. The Disney Wish was primarily powered by liquified natural gas in fiscal 2022, which, when compared to traditional diesel or marine fuel, significantly reduces several emissions and pollutants."

In collaboration with our various design teams across Disney, and leveraging the creative expertise of our Disney Imagineers, we follow a rigorous set of internal Sustainable Design Standards aligned with our 2030 goals.
