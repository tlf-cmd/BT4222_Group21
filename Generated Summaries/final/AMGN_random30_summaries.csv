Operational Eco-Efficiency,"As of January 1, 2022, Barreras team has placed orders for 195 electric vehicles, which have been assigned to field staff. Globally, Amgens field fleet represents around 15% of the Companys overall carbon footprint. By 2027, we plan to convert 30% of our sales fleet vehicles to electric vehicles (EV)Carbon emissions from onsite combustion of fuel and purchased energy in 2021 decreased by 88,000 metric tons from 2020. Renewable electricity accounted for 79% of our total electricity consumption, compared to 41% in 2020. Amgen is providing home charger installation and hosting driver workshops to educate on issues.","Finally, renewable energy sources provided 79% of Amgens total electricity consumption in 2021, up from 41% in 2020 . ENERGY In 2021, we increased the amount of renewable energy in our purchased electricity to 79% compared to 41% in 2020 . Projects range from installing innovative renewable energy technologies, such as onsite solar arrays, to purchasing electricity from renewable sources . In 2021, we increased the number of facilities sourcing renewable energy, including our major North American sites in Rhode Island and our headquarters in California; our aim is for all Amgen facilities, wherever feasible, to procure 100% renewable electricity by 2027 . We achieved this increase in renewable electricity through the purchase of renewable energy certificates for electricity consumption at our North American facilities . We purchased in-country renewable energy certificates to make our facilities in Thousand Oaks, CA; West Greenwich, RI; Louisville, KY; Cambridge, MA; Breda, Netherlands; and Singapore use 100% renewable electricity . Renewable Energy The generation and procurement of clean, renewable energy is an important component of achieving our 2027 carbon neutrality target .29 Across our network, each Amgen facility has a portfolio of renewable energy projects . At the end of 2021, renewable electricity accounted for 79% of our total electricity consumption, compared to 41% in 2020 .
