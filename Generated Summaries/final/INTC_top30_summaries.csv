Through our regular Employee Experience Surveys , employees can voice their percep - tions of the company and their work experience, including their views on our diversity and inclusion performance and culture. Linking Compensation to Diversity and Inclusion Goals Since 2008, we have linked a portion of our executive and employee compensation to corporate responsibility metrics, including diversity and inclusion metrics. Diversity and inclusion start from the moment we identify candidates and try to fill roles with the best available talent. Since 2018, Intel has been a member of the Thirty Percent Coalition , which focuses on strategies to increase gender, racial and ethnic diversity on corpo - rate boards. Intel India is actively driving STEM training for girls in the ecosystem through various diversity and inclusion programs including BeingWISE (Women Innovators, Social Leaders, and Entrepreneurs), an industry-wide initiative to accelerate womens participation in the workforce. In 2020, we hosted a series of visioning conversations with representatives of 19 chief diversity and inclusion officer teams across our industry and adjacent ones. We more than doubled mem - bership and made meaningful progress on creating an inclusion index to help companies track diversity and inclusion improvements against a shared benchmark. In 2022, the goals related to inclusion include: increasing by another 10% the representation of Black/African American employees in senior, director, and executive level roles in our US workforce; women representing 30% of technical entry-level hires; and $1.4 billion in annual spending with diverse suppliers. We also met our commitment to reach more than $1 billion in annual spending with tier 1 and tier 2 certified diverse suppliers,1 and collaborate with others to encourage more women and underrepresented minorities to enter and succeed in technology careers. 1 We recognize certified diverse suppliers as businesses that are at least 51% owned, operated, and controlled by any of the following categories: women; minorities as recognized by the country or region where the business was established; veterans/military service- disabled veterans; persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender; or persons with disabilities. 1 We recognize certified diverse suppliers as businesses that are at least 51% owned, operated, and controlled by any of the following categories: women; minorities as recognized by the country or region where the business was established; veterans/military service-disabled veterans; persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender; or persons with disabilities. Building a More Inclusive Workforce In 2021, we continued our focus on career development and progression of diverse talent, and saw absolute numbers increase in all categories. Just as we value diversity and inclusion to foster innovation within Intel, our commitment to diversity and inclusion extends to our suppliers. The goal is to foster training opportunities to increase the capabilities, diversity, and number of students who are prepared to engage in the quantum workforce. First, we recognized that some of our diversity and inclusion efforts have been more US focused, even though Intel is a global company. Building a diverse and inclusive workforce and industry requires continued collective investments and innovative approaches to increasing the diversity of the talent pipeline and expanding access to the education resources needed to pursue careers in our field. The result was the launch in 2021 of the Alliance for Global Inclusion , a coalition focused on creating a shared set of diversity and inclusion metrics. In support of this goal, we first publicly released our EEO-1 survey pay data in 2019, we feel it is important to continue collecting and disclosing diversity and inclusion data publicly. For more than a decade, we have taken actions to deeply integrate diversity and inclusion expectations into our culture, performance management systems, leadership expectations, and annual bonus metrics. Intel has ERGs organized around race, national origin, sexual orientation and gender identity, parent - hood, disabilities, education, faith and beliefs, and other common affinities. We are intensifying actions to advance our 2030 goals, which include doubling the number of women and underrepresented minorities in senior leadership and increasing the representation of women in technical roles to 40%. Detailed information on our diversity and inclusion initiatives is available on our Diversity and Inclusion website and in the Inclusive section of this report. We also recognized that some communities have felt excluded from our diversity and inclusion efforts. 2 We recognize diverse suppliers as businesses that are 51% owned and operated by at least one of the following: women; minorities as defined by the country or region where the business was established; veterans/ service-disabled veterans; persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender; or persons who are disabled. 2 We recognize diverse suppliers as businesses that are 51% owned and operated by at least one of the following: women; minorities as defined by the country or region where the business was established; veterans/service-disabled veterans; persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender; or persons who are disabled. We have taken actions to integrate our inclusion expectations into our policies, performance management systems, leadership expectations, annual bonus metrics, and employee surveys. Corporate Religious Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Index Rep Trak. We will continue to advance inclusion in our workforce using a holistic approach toward representa - tion, pay equity, and creating an inclusive and accessible culture that enables employees to develop and progress in their careers at all levels. Since 2008, we have included criteria related to corporate responsibility metrics such as diversity and inclusion and sustainability performance. Their mission is to promote the progression and growth of diverse employ - ees and foster an inclusive culture where all employees can thrive professionally. Since its launch, the Alliance has more than doubled in size, from five to 12 members and has made meaningful progress on creating an Inclusion Index to serve as a benchmark for companies to track diversity and inclusion improvements, provide information on current best practices, and highlight opportunities to improve outcomes across industries."

Our Corporate Energy Management System follows the ISO 50001 Energy Management Standard; to date, we have received third-party ISO 50001 accred - itation for all of our manufacturing sites. Progress on the client component of our product energy efficiency goal is measured using SPEC CPU2017 Integer Rate benchmark and Display On Idle Power using an end of 2019 baseline. Efficiency coresused in the upcoming Intel Xeon processor code-named Sierra Forrestenable lower power consumption across workloads that are optimized for best power efficiency. Specifically, we focus on reducing compo - nent count and the area of the main board, and increasing system and display energy efficiency. In China, as part of industry consortia we are working with China National Institute of Standardization to agree on a workable solution for SPEC SERT suite and Chinas indigenous benchmark tool (BenchSEE) to co-exist, in order to comply with Chinas upcoming server energy- efficiency standard. For server energy efficiency, Intel collaborated with technology industry consortia and European Standard - ization Organizations to support development of new harmonized standards in support of EU Lot 9 server regulation already in effect. Energy Conservation Reducing operational energy use is core to Intels overall climate strategy and our 2030 goals. Our energy management systems follow the international ISO 50001 Energy Management System standard. This includes detail regarding our investments in renewable electricity, energy conservation, and product energy efficiency. Yearly emissions due to energy consumption of Intel processors are expected to trend downwards as our customers further adopt renewable electricity initiatives and goals. In 2021, approximately 83% of our global energy use was electricity. We have also achieved a 19% absolute reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2000, even as we expanded our manufacturing capacity significantly.2021-22 Corporate Responsibility Report, p 69 2021 Intel Annual Report on Form 10-K , p 15 2022 Proxy Statement , p 51 CDP Climate Change Survey Energy Management in Manufacturing(1) T otal energy consumed, (2) percentage grid electricity, and (3) percentage renewableTC-SC- 130a.1(1) 41.9 million gigajoules energy consumed (2) 83% grid electricity (3) 80% renewable energy globally.2021-22 Corporate Responsibility Report, p 68 , p 69 , and p 70 Water Management(1) T otal water withdrawn and (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water StressTC-SC- 140a.1(1) 54.1 million m withdrawn (2) 11.6 million m consumed.

Conserve 4 billion kWh of energy. We also contributed to server energy-efficiency standards initiatives in the UK and India. 80% green power globally In 2021, we maintained our renewable electricity supply at 100% in the US, Europe, Israel, and Malaysia, and achieved 80% renewable electricity globally. In addition to generating on-site and off-site renewable electricity and purchasing renewable electricity from our utility suppliers, we purchase green attributes from multiple sources of generation. Scope 2 (Indirect, Electricity) 1,093,000Market-based method;2 includes renewable electricity purchases. Our 2030 goals include achieving net positive water, 100% renewable electricity, zero waste to landfill, and further reduction in our absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, even as we continue to expand our manufacturing capacity. For many years, we have obtained third-party verification for our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reducing Our Operational Carbon Footprint For over two decades, Intel has set aggressive green - house gas (GHG) reduction goals to conserve energy and minimize GHG emissions. Were now raising the bar and entering an exciting era to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our operations by 2040. Renewable and Alternative Electricity In addition to conserving energy, we pur - chase green power and operate on-site alternative electricity projects that provide power directly to Intel buildings."
Supply Chain Management,"Intels supply chain security risk management program is derived from standard industry risk management frameworks such as NIST and ISO. Intel conducted risk mitigation in our supply chain, including smelter outreach and country of origin assessments, as well as working with direct suppliers to facilitate alternative sourcing.In 2021, 99% of the relevant suppliers and refiners reported in our supply chain are deemed responsibly sourced. We strive to audit 100% of high-risk supplier sites within a two-year cycle. Our vision to grow a diverse and inclusive global supply chain includes increasing our annual spending with diverse-owned suppliers.","T o build on these benefits and drive increased focus and coordination, we are taking an integrated approach across our supply chain groups (Materials and Equipment Sourcing, Logistics, and Resale) to building a common set of circular economy performance metrics. In addition, we will continue to actively participate in external chemical management initiatives geared toward the improvement of chemical management practices within our supply chain. We intend to apply the chemical footprint methodology not only to Intels direct manufacturing operations, but also to integrate the methodology within the semicon - ductor manufacturing supply chain both upstream and downstream of our manufacturing operations. This is an important step in our RISE strategy, as we begin mapping our supply chains for our highest priority minerals. Planning and assessment Architecture Design1 42 3 56 ImplementationSecurity validationRelease/ post deployment Security Development LifecycleSecuring Intels Supply Chain Our sourcing and manufacturing practices are built on decades of experience and aligned to industry-leading processes. As a result, Intel s direct environmental footprint is more significant than those of our fab-less competitors, whose manufacturing footprints sit in their supply chains. Intels supply chain security risk management program is derived from standard industry risk management frameworks such as NIST and ISO and provides security assurance through the integration of security controls throughout sourcing and supplier management practices. Intel conducted risk mitigation in our supply chain, including smelter outreach and country of origin assessments, as well as working with direct suppliers to facilitate alternative sourcing where appropriate. We are also evaluating the impact of IDM2.0 supply chain changes. T o contribute to standards and help define and engage in due diligence within the copper supply chain, Intel is an active partner member of The Copper Mark , participat - ing in its Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA) T echnical Revision Committee and T echnical Working Group. Additionally, we continue to partner with industry associations to ensure standards are in place to enable our ultimate goal of responsible sourcing for all the minerals in our supply chain. In 2021, we continued to review ongoing COVID-19 and supply chain challenges through our Supply Chain Command Center. We continue to work across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity, and increase overall capacity and output to meet customer expectations. For more information on our social and relationship capital, see Stakeholder Engagement and Supply Chain Responsibility later in this section. We use the information to identify potential mineral supply chain risks. Such collabo - ration is crucial to identify and address risks associated with mineral extraction and trade in complex mineral supply chains. Of those suppliers, 99% submitted the questionnaire, and 92% of them made their responses public, giving both Intel and other stakeholders information about the environmental performance of our supply chain. Through our annual supply chain survey process, in 2021, 99% of the relevant suppliers and refiners reported in our supply chain are deemed responsibly sourced through their conformance to and/or participa - tion in a responsible minerals assurance program. A Risk-Based Approach to Supplier Assessments New Supplier Assessment: A short survey is sent to new suppliers to determine whether a facility is of potential high risk. Supply Chain T op 25Hispanic Association of Corporate Responsibility. We strive to audit 100% of high-risk supplier sites within a two-year cycle. Our sustainability criteria have also been embedded into our supplier quality assessment process to further extend our reach into the supply chain. Strengthening Supplier Capabilities For more than a decade, we have worked to help less mature and evolving suppliers build critical sustainability and corporate responsibility acumen, including a focus on compliance with the RBA and our Code of Conduct expectations and requirements. As such, in 2021, Intel began driving knowledge of and compliance to the RBA Code of Conduct deeper into our supply chain than in previous years. Our Business Responsible Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix 9 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportIntroduction T echnology Industry Initiatives Building on the foundation of our operational and supply chain goals, we will work with the technology ecosystem to accelerate improvements across our industry. Operational and Supply Chain Goals: 100% Green Power. Over a dozen years ago, Intel began work to responsibly source conflict minerals,1 and in 2017 we expanded our efforts to also address cobalt in our supply chain. Our vision to grow a diverse and inclusive global supply chain includes increasing our annual spending with diverse-owned suppliers to $2 billion by 2030, as well as working with others to expand and enable inclusive sourcing practices across the industry. For example, our annual Combating Modern Slavery and Ensuring Transparent Supply Chains statement is discussed with our Board and signed by one of our directors. Our strategy not only raises the bar for ourselves and our supply chain, but also increases the scale and global impact of our work through new collaborations with our customers and a broad range of stakeholders. Operational and Supply Chain Goals: Senior Leadership. In 2021, we assessed 374 supplier facilities based on this risk assessment and past performance, a 92% increase from 2020. We collaborate with other companies and lead initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we are advancing industry collaboration on responsible minerals sourcing. T o learn more, see Public Policy and Political Accountability and Supply Chain Responsibility in the Our Business section of this report. 5 Lower risk suppliers refers to suppliers deemed below average risk, based on data and supplier performance. Our vision to grow a diverse and inclusive global supply chain includes increasing our annual spending with diverse-owned suppliers, as well as working with others to expand and enable inclusive sourcing practices across the industry. Our significant invest - ments of time and resources are aimed at influencing system-level, industry-wide improvements to protect and empower workers in the global electronics supply chain and to reduce community impacts.
