Operational Eco-Efficiency,"For Meta, efficiency and renewable energy are key components of our approach to designing, building and operating sustainable data centers. Meta has worked with utility partners, PNM and Tennessee Valley Authority, to add 130 MW of battery energy storage to the grid in New Mexico, Kentucky and Mississippi.Over 4,900 MW of new renewable energy is now operating. This provides greater reliability and flexibility to the utility system. It enables a much lower carbon footprint, as utilities integrate even more renewable energy.","However, energy storage can help to smooth the small deviations in energy production on the system to help integrate greater volumes of renewable energy. This unique commercial structure allows customers like us to directly pay for capacity resources like energy storage to offset the need to add nonrenewable energy resources to the system. Adding energy storage to the grid is an important tool that enables utilities to move the electricity produced from a solar project, for instance, into times of the day when sunshine is not available. In alignment with our 100% renewable energy commitment, we purchased renewable energy to cover the electricity used by Meta employees working from home. We identified nearly 9,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of potential annual energy savings within the suppliers mechanical and electrical facility-level equipment. For example, we conducted an energy-efficiency assessment for a data center hardware supplier in 2021. As part of this program, we aim to: Reduce food waste through innovative food preparation and serving practices, as well as waste tracking and sorting technology Reduce packaging waste by integrating circular economic practices into our culinary offering and reducing single usewe have eliminated plastic water bottles for our facilities globally Reduce the carbon intensity of our ingredients through creative plant-forward menus and supporting regenerative food systems Reduce the carbon impact of cooking through increasing our use of all-electric kitchens WORKPLACES The food system accounts for roughly 30% of global energy use. Our Odense data center earned Green Data Center of the Year honors for Special Contribution to improving Energy Efficiency at the Data Center World Awards. S. solar and wind projects in our portfolio studied, 96% Energy Storage Demand for electricity varies significantly throughout the day. The amount of sunshine that continuously strikes the earth equates to more than 10,000 times the worlds total energy use. Of the 500 MW of solar that will be added in the next few years, 450 MW will support our 960,000-square-foot Mesa data center with 100% renewable energy, leaving 50 MW for SRP to offer residential and small business customers, supporting broader customer access to renewable energy. For the Earth For Meta, efficiency and renewable energy are key components of our approach to designing, building and operating sustainable data centers. In total, Meta has worked with utility partners, PNM and Tennessee Valley Authority, to add 130 MW of battery energy storage to the grid in New Mexico, Kentucky, and Mississippi. The facility will be able to save not only energy (and related indirect emissions) but also energy costs, with payback periods ranging from less than one year to up to four years. Additionally, to prevent wasted energy when demand is low on sunny or windy days, and to support grid reliability on cloudy, calm days, large-scale storage is critical. Renewable energy technology, like wind and solar, are weather-dependent, so they do not necessarily match the variations in electricity demand on their own. Finally, as we look forward, we believe that we must build on achieving our 100% renewable energy goals by optimizing our energy strategy to drive emissions reductions at a grid-scale. Of that, over 4,900 MW of new renewable energy is now operating. This provides greater reliability and flexibility to the utility system and enables a much lower carbon footprint, as utilities integrate even more renewable energy on their grids. These utility offerings allow large energy customers to purchase renewable energy and renewable energy credits via their retail electricity service and address their sustainability goals.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS Meta is committed to addressing GHG emissions across our global operations, value chain and beyond. To lower the carbon impact of concretea large source of global GHG emissionswe expanded our partnership with researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigns civil engineering and computer science departments to use an artificial intelligence (AI) model to generate low-carbon mix designs. We began working with a select group of our suppliers in 2021 to calculate and report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Other data center-related facilities includes facilities where Meta used less than 100,000 MWh of electricity in the reporting year, such as warehouses or colocation facilities. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS As we focus our attention on decarbonizing our Scope 3 emissions, we are working now to identify solutions that can scale as our business grows. Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated annually based on the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol . In 2020, we achieved net zero GHG emissions in our direct operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by reducing our emissions by 94% compared to 2017 levels. To address any emissions we cannot reduce, we will remove an equivalent amount of GHG emissions through verified carbon removal projects that prioritize social and environmental benefits. A better reality will not truly be possible unless we, our partners and our suppliers work together to strategically reduce GHG emissions. Meta first reported its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2011 and began reporting Scope 3 emissions in 2019. In 2022, we will provide capacity- building training to our top 100 suppliers on measuring their GHG impact, setting reduction goals and identifying ways to reduce their emissions. Our GHG footprint includes the emissions associated with running our business and data centers, as well as the indirect emissions created upstream from our operations and downstream in our products. To achieve this goal, we are focused on achieving the following reductions from a 2019 baseline per capita: 40% energy use reduction 50% waste reduction 100% sustainable employee commuter shuttle fleet 40% reduction in drive alone commuter trips 40% reduction in embodied carbon of building materials 60% reduction in carbon intensity of culinary offerings Reducing Our GHG Emissions Reducing GHG emissions across our global operations and value chain is our top priority and the most effective strategy to reach net zero.
