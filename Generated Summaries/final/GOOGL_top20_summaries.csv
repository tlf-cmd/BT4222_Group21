Operational Eco-Efficiency,"Google is evolving from matching annual energy consumption with renewable energy to sourcing carbon-free energy every hour of every day, everywhere. Google was the largest organization, in terms of electricity consumption, to achieve a 100% renewable energy match. Using typical energy costs, we estimated average savings of $131 to $145 a year.We are the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable energy. We currently make up for this by buying surplus renewable energy in regions where its abundant. Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable sources.","To attain this, were evolving from matching our annual energy consumption with renewable energy to sourcing carbon-free energy every hour of every day, everywhere. First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energy efficiency initiatives. Achieved Missed In progress 8 Google Environmental Report 2022ADVANCING CARBON-FREE ENERGY Target Deadline 2021 progress Status Energy Match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with renewable energy purchases.2021 (Annual)In 2021, we purchased enough renewable energy, from sources such as wind and solar, to match 100% of the electricity consumption of our data centers and offices. Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy. 11 Google Environmental Report 2022Key performance indicatorAssured for 2021 Unit Fiscal year 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 ENERGY Energy use Energy consumption40 MWh 8,029,409 10,572,485 12,749,458 15,439,538 18,571,659 Total electricity consumption MWh 7,609,089 10,104,295 12,237,198 15,138,543 18,287,143 Electricity consumption (U. Google was the largest organization, in terms of electricity consumption, to achieve a 100% renewable energy match. Energy Savings from the Nest Learning Thermostat: Energy Bill Analysis Results , Nest Labs, February 2015. The location-based category reflects the average carbon intensity of the electric grids where our operations are located and thus where our energy consumption occurs. For example, by buying larger amounts of wind energy in places like Europe, we compensate for our lack of renewable energy purchases in Asia. Google currently buys enough renewable energy to match our annual global electricity consumption. To achieve our 100% renewable energy match goal, we first consider both our on-site renewable energy generation and the renewable energy that is already in the electric grids where our facilities are located, then procure renewable energy through PPA contracts. This metric includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of non-computing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to power IT equipment. Using typical energy costs, weve estimated average savings of $131 to $145 a year. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations (i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) with the total volume of electricity consumed by our operations. Our carbon-free energy (CFE) percentage measures the degree to which our electricity consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis. This guidance does not recognize existing renewable energy on the electric grids where an entitys operations are located. We have a few facilities located in geographies where were not currently able to source large volumes of renewable energy, so we currently make up for this by buying surplus renewable energy in regions where its abundant. Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable sources. 2017: We became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable energy, which weve achieved for five consecutive years.

These targeted investments go beyond our purchases of renewable energy for our own operational footprint. This estimated spend commitment is for clean energy purchased for our operations. Over that period, weve committed approximately $6 billion to purchase clean energy from wind and solar projects globally through 2040.5 100 % renewable energy In 2021, we matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with renewable energy purchases for the fifth consecutive year.73 million MWh of renewable energy Over the past decade, Google purchased more renewable energy than any other company.6 From 2010 to 2021, we purchased a total of more than 73 million MWh of renewable energy through PPAs, via on-site generation, and from the electric grids where our facilities are located.7$3.3 billion in investment commitments From 2010 to 2021, we made commitments to invest nearly $3.3 billion in renewable energy projects with an expected combined capacity of approximately 8.7 GW. 2030 In 2021, on an hourly basis, 66% of our data center electricity use was matched with regional carbon-free sources.15 Enable 5 GW of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions by 2030.2030 Were working toward this target. Based on our cumulative renewable electricity purchased in megawatt-hours (MWh) from 2012 to 2021. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means nearly all the energy is used for computing. While our total GHG emissions increased from 2020 to 2021, were committed to achieving GHG reductions throughout our operations and value chain. This approach results in Googles Scope 2 market-based emissions being greater than zero as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance , despite us achieving our 100% renewable energy match globally. GHG emissions are calculated according to Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards and guidance , developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), including A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) , Scope 2 Guidance , and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard . In the 2021 Independent Accountants Review Report, the Schedule of Operational GHG emissions After Compensation Adjustments only includes the market-based metric. For more details, see our 2021 white paper, Carbon-free Energy Performance at Google Data Centers . Prior to 2016, we were not accounting for the renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity. Teleworking emissions are reported as part of our Scope 3 emissions for employee commuting, per Greenhouse Gas Protocols Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0) . Carbon credits are reductions in GHG emissions made to compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere. Because of our purchases of renewable energy and procurement of high-quality carbon credits, we have compensated for all our operational GHG emissions. 2021 (Annual)In 2021, we purchased enough renewable energy and high- quality carbon credits to compensate for all our operational GHG emissions. We obtain third-party assurance from an independent, accredited auditor for specific environmental data as part of our Independent Accountants Review , including select GHG emissions, energy, and water metrics as indicated in the table below. In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol released updated Scope 2 guidance for the accounting of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data."
