The Board added five new independent directors in 2021. A hotline steering committee reviews reports of suspected violations. The Board is comprised of independent directors and the CEO. ExxonMobils incumbent directors, on average, attended approximately 97% of Board and committee meetings in 2021. Each of our directors, officers and employees is expected to observe the highest standards of integrity. Our efforts are overseen by our Board of Directors, which provides guidance to company management. Individuals can email our non-employee directors through the corporate governance page of our website. Environmental Aspects Guide (EAG)Access to remedy Consistent with international standards, we help provide effective, accessible and culturally appropriate channels for individuals or communities to raise concerns in a way that seeks to support confidentiality and non-retaliation. Qualifications sought for director nominees are documented in the Boards Guidelines for the Selection of Non-Employee Directors. An independent lead director is selected by and from the independent directors. All communications are recorded by an ExxonMobil assistant secretary or designated staff member and forwarded to the appropriate director or directors or otherwise handled as the Nominating and Governance Committee has directed. The lead director is expected to serve for a minimum of two years. To enhance Board governance, ExxonMobils independent lead directors board authorities were enhanced in 2020 and include leading the annual performance evaluation of the Board and its committees. The Nominating and Governance Committee has established procedures for shareholders and other interested parties to communicate with Board members. The average tenure of our non-employee directors at year-end 2021 was 3.8 years, which was well below the 2021 average of S&P 500 companies of 7.7 years [2]. The Board believes shareholder interests are best served through a leadership model combining the roles of Chairman of the Board and chief executive officer . Individual directors leverage their experience and knowledge in Board and committee deliberations and Board decisions reflect the collective wisdom of the group. Additionally, the lead director works together with the Compensation Committee to oversee the annual evaluation of the CEO, the communication of resulting feedback to the CEO and the review of CEO succession plans. Our directors, officers and employees are required to review these policies annually and apply them in their work."

Because of their efforts, ExxonMobil delivered industry-leading safety, reliability and financial results in an extremely challenging environment. Our primary objective is to help protect our people, communities and the environment by successfully managing and enhancing process safety. For example, in Papua New Guinea, our Community Health, Safety and Security Management Plan includes a summary of the identified risks, as well as mitigation and management measures. This table reflects the latest set of performance data as of December 9, 2022 for Environment and November 10, 2022 for Safety. To become a supplier for ExxonMobil a local vendor must meet our robust safety, technical, environmental and human rights expectations and requirements. Thanks to the work of the many collaborations with governments, businesses and civil society, malarial deaths have been reduced by more than half since 2000 and infection rates have drastically declined.
