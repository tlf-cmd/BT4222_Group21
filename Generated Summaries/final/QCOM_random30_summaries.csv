Qualcomm T echnologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated, operates, along with its subsidiaries, substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions and substantially all of our products and services businesses, including our QCT semiconductor business. Revamping our Wearable T ech curriculum to expand across multiple Io T sectors. Other than for our RF front-end modules and RF filter products, our QCT semiconductor business utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Our back-end manufacturing facilities are located in China and Singapore. Therefore, we primarily rely on third parties to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs.

We continue to inspire new inventions that help enable our customers and partners to create technologies and experiences weve yet to imagine. This year, we added to our Thinkabit Lab curriculum, by: Adding a new sustainability theme to our projects to encourage these future inventors to integrate a sustainability mindset as part of their design and invention process.

Our Qualcomm CDMA T echnologies (QCT) Production Model Other than for certain of our radio frequency front- end (RFFE) modules and radio frequency (RF) filter products, QCT utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. As we continue to expand our technologies into more types of devices and applications, such as Automotive and Io T, the Companys services and support structures have correspondingly grown.

Supply Chain Management,"Qualcomm is aware of concerns that minerals mined in conflict areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) may be making their way into the electronics industry supply chain. Indirect salient human rights risks exist primarily in our supply chains and with local community members.Our efforts to prevent, mitigate and remediate our human rights risks and impacts in our supply chain include annual assessments of suppliers operations in accordance with the RBA SAQ. We operate a supplier cybersecurity assurance program, which is integrated with our procurement processes, to assess and attempt to remediate cybersecurity risks across our supplier community. We expect our suppliers to uphold the same corporate responsibility standards as ours.The Qualcomm ESG Leadership Committee is composed of executives and senior management from across the Company. The SAQ is a risk-assessment tool that enables companies to evaluate specific supply chain risk in areas such as labor, health and safety, environment and ethics.","These assess potential risks across our operations and/or value chain, including risks related to employees, manufacturing facilities, supply chain and communities. Our efforts to prevent, mitigate and remediate our human rights risks and impacts in our supply chain include annual assessments of suppliers operations in accordance with the RBA SAQ, engagement with suppliers to ensure conformance to our expectations, risk-based onsite audits and participation in multi- stakeholder initiatives. T o ensure their continued effectiveness, weve designed corrective action processes, including the potential removal of deficient suppliers from our supply chain. The RBA Code of Conduct, which serves as our Supplier Code of Conduct , and The Qualcomm Way: Our Code of Business Conduct have been cornerstones of our commitment to the RBA and responsible supply chain management for many years. Environmental Management in the Supply Chain Each of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers is required to have an ISO14001-certified environmental management system, and all report meeting this requirement as of 2022. These Company-supported programs have incubated or mentored more than 162 startups since 2016 in emerging markets, particularly those with an intensifying design talent pool and growing supply chain and local manufacturing expertise, such as India, T aiwan and Vietnam. Understanding risks and ensuring supply chain sustainability is a key part of acting responsibly. 7 Given equivalent features.2030 and 2040 Goals2025 Goals Ensure 100% of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers are audited every 2 years for conformance to the Supplier Code of Conduct, from a 2020 base year. Regularly assessing and monitoring suppliers for compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct allows us to minimize potential harm to individuals, communities and the environment, as well as create more resilient supply chains. Making appropriate supplier selections, conducting comprehensive onboarding, assessing for risks and monitoring adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct are integral to how we achieve a sustainable and responsible supply chain. Ensure 100% of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers are audited every 2 years for conformance to the Supplier Code of Conduct by 2025, from a 2020 base year. Ensure 100% of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers are audited every 2 years for conformance to the Supplier Code of Conduct, from a 2020 base year. Our supply chain management team maintains RBA Lead Auditor trained personnel who conduct on-site audits of selected suppliers for their adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct and other corporate responsibility requirements, including product environmental governance and conflict minerals. As of 2022, 88% of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers have received audits for conformance to the Supplier Code of Conduct.

We believe helping our suppliers build greater knowledge of corporate responsibility issues, such as human rights, responsible minerals sourcing and selecting less harmful substances for manufacturing, can create and improve corporate responsibility throughout our supply chains. Maintain adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct in our extended supply chain. As part of our risk-based approach, we require our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers to complete the RBA Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) annually. This Committee includes managers and other subject matter experts from functions across the Company, including Investor Relations, Supply Chain Management, DEI, STEM Education, Operations, Human Rights, Privacy, Cybersecurity, Health and Safety and Legal, among others. Indirect salient human rights risks exist primarily in our supply chains and with local community members. In addition, we encourage our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers to complete an RBA Validated Assessment Process (VAP) audit. We have a 2025 goal of ensuring 100 percent of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers are audited at least every two years. This cross-functional team includes representatives from departments including Legal, Procurement, Corporate Responsibility, Government Affairs, Environment, Health and Safety, Security, DEI, Supply Chain, Risk and Compliance, Privacy and Cybersecurity. The SAQ is a risk-assessment tool that enables companies to evaluate specific supply chain risk in areas such as labor, health and safety, environment and ethics. 9 The primary foundry suppliers and primary semiconductor assembly and test suppliers that are listed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the corresponding year. The SAQ results from our suppliers have indicated that 100 percent of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers have all low-risk manufacturing facilities. All our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers comply with this requirement, and all have low-risk manufacturing facilities according to the SAQ ratings.
