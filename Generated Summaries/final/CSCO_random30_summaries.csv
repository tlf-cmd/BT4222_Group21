Cisco has a comprehensive engagement strategy with suppliers that includes: ySetting policies and standards yAssessing suppliers conformance to those policies yHelping suppliers improve yImplementing targeted initiatives for specific risks and opportunities yEngaging with industry peers and stakeholders to drive global progress Cisco was one of the original founders of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and helped develop the first iteration of its Code of Conduct. We govern human rights within our business and supply chain through our Global Human Rights Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct , which are managed by our Business and Human Rights team and Supply Chain Sustainability team. Supplier Engagement 8. Our second-largest source of emissions is our supply chain. Within our supply chain Making the world a better place with technology begins with how that technology is made. We work to mitigate and prevent human rights risks in our supply chain. In collaboration with key partners and suppliers, weve recently completed the modernization initiatives for an initial group of eight HBCUs. Helping our customers and suppliers meet their own decarbonization goals is a critical way that Cisco will help bring about a digital and low-carbon future. In fiscal 2022, 91 percent of the smelters and refiners reported by in-scope suppliers for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (3TG) were low-risk; 62 percent reported cobalt refiners were also low-risk. Supply chain engagement can also catalyze greater worker opportunity and wellbeing. In fiscal 2022, we began discussing how we could share our highly effective Building Skills for a Conscious Culture training with key suppliers. In fiscal 2022, 53 preferred suppliers shared diversity metrics. S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order mandating more transparency in the software supply chain.

Operational Eco-Efficiency,"Cisco is reporting progress through the near-term targets, below Near-Term Targets By FY25: Reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 90%1 (FY19 base year). These prizes are specifically for solutions that reduce or remove GHGs in the atmosphere or regenerate depleted ecosystems. Cisco operations account for only 1 percent of our total GHG emissions.In fiscal 2022, implemented 34 energy efficiency projects that avoid approximately 14 .5 GWh of energy consumption and 8000 metric tonne CO2e annually. ByFY25: 80% of Cisco component, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers by spend will have a public, absolute GHG emissions reduction target.Fiscal 2022 highlights Reached 17 .5 million students through Cisco Networking Academy since 1997. Maintained >80% employee participation in community impact for third year in a row Provided support to Ukraine, including approximately US$6 million in Cisco equipment.","In fiscal 2022, we completed our energy efficiency goal, achieving 87 percent system power efficiency in our large rack-mounted equipment, as measured from the input power from the facility to the board-mounted ASICs, memory, and other chip devices. We are actively pursuing a strategy to increase our procurement of renewable energy through long-term PPAs in the near term with a view to adding new renewable energy to the grid. In fiscal 2022, 89 percent of our global electricity came from renewable energy sources, including 100 percent in the United States, Canada, and several European countries . This could help with fluctuations in renewable energy generation and move smart buildings closer to net zero. The redesign of our Penn 1 building in New York City uses Power over Ethernet capabilities that removed thousands of pounds of steel conduit and copper from the building and reduced energy needs by tons of megawatts. Vehicles can act as local energy storage alongside renewables, says Peter Shearman, Cisco Head of Innovation, United Kingdom and Ireland. From fiscal 2017 through the end of fiscal 2022, we invested approximately US$60 million to execute hundreds of energy-efficiency projects across our operations and achieved our previous goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 60 percent (compared to fiscal 2007 base year). We reached this goal by focusing on three of our four areas for improvement, including using high-efficiency power supplies, optimizing ASIC power distribution, and optimizing system power distribution. With these insights, we can automatically adjust smart blinds, lighting, and HVAC settingsfurther reducing our expenses and energy use. One example of searching for that innovation within the internal team is a Net Zero Challenge we held where we asked anyone within CHG to brainstorm ideas for energy efficiency and ways to reduce power needs. We are ramping up both our onsite and offsite renewable energy efforts, targeting approximately 5 MW of new onsite solar and securing over 500 MW of new long-term renewable energy contracts by the end of fiscal 2025. Our engineers have made great progress in power efficiency and circular design, and were also seeing customers ask for more capabilities and greater bandwidth that increase power demands. As a large, global company, we want to do our part to decrease the GHG emissions associated with our business and help our customers do the same. Increasing our use of renewable electricity is a fundamental part of our strategy.

However, we remain committed to reducing GHG emissions in our operations by procuring renewable electricity and improving the efficiency of our offices, labs, and data centers. These prizes are specifically for solutions that reduce or remove GHGs in the atmosphere or regenerate depleted ecosystems. Cisco has set a goal that 80 percent of our top component, manufacturing and logistics suppliers will set public GHG emissions reductions targets by 2025, and we regularly share our learnings with them. Net-zero goal By 2040: Reach net zero GHG emissions by reducing absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 90 percent1 (FY19 base year). If it proves successful at scale, V2G could become a critical part of a lower-carbon future, as well as helping energy managers reduce operational costs. These prizes were awarded to teams with solutions to reduce or remove GHG emissions or regenerate depleted ecosystems. These technologies would treat every EV like a battery that can supply power back to a network or building. S. Environmental Protection Agencys Green Power Partnership and, in fiscal 2022, began engaging our suppliers in the Asia-Pacific region on renewable energy as part of their GHG emissions reduction plans. As a result, supply chain-related Scope 3 emissions make up approximately one quarter of our GHG footprint. Achieved 87% efficiency By FY25: 80% of Cisco component, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers by spend will have a public, absolute GHG emissions reduction target. Cisco operations account for only 1 percent of our total GHG emissions. But power grids may not be prepared for demand from millions of electric vehicles (EVs) trying to charge at the same time. Since 2016, weve reduced our data center power consumption by 40 percent, significantly increased internal reuse of equipment, and reduced our facility data center costs by 23 percent. Cisco has been setting and achieving five-year GHG reduction goals since 2008, and recently announced our most ambitious goal yet. FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 45 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting Hub1 and neutralizing any remaining emissions by removing an equal amount from the atmosphere 2 This goal expands on our previous goal to reduce Ciscos absolute supply chain-related Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30 percent by fiscal 2030 and includes the use of sold products. To achieve our fiscal 2025 goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions 90 percent (compared to fiscal 2019 base year), we have committed to investing an additional US$39 million from fiscal years 2023 to 2025 to continue funding efficiency, renewable energy, and electrification projects. In Cisco lab tests, the new Nexus 9800 series switches, built using modular design and both 80 Plus Titanium-rated and Platinum-rated power supplies, were shown to be 1.6 times more efficient than the 400G GX-based Nexus 9500 series. Hybrid work can also have environmental benefits, particularly when combined with smart building technology that uses sensors and low-voltage Power over Ethernet. Solutions must measurably reduce GHG emissions, waste, or energy consumption; accelerate climate innovation; and demonstrate collaboration. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies could help reduce pressure on electricity grids, especially during peak charging times. That means we must think even bigger, exploring ways to accelerate renewable energy adoption and the greening of the grid. Over the last several years, we have focused on shifting transport from air to ocean when possible, working with suppliers to set absolute GHG emissions reduction goals, and asking suppliers to transparently report on GHG emissions reduction progress to CDP annually. How will the energy grid cope when everyone is doing it?"
Product Stewardship,"In fiscal 2022, we had a soft launch of the scoring tool to evaluate 13 percent of new products and packaging, and 33 percent of them successfully met our circular design criteria. For many product lines, we have replaced plastic with more sustainable materials, including recycled paperboard and wax paper. For power cords, we replaced plastic bags with scannable wraps.Cisco's net-zero goal includes two near-term targets: yTo reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 90 percent1 by fiscal 2025 compared to our 2019 fiscal year yTo reduction absolute Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution, and use of sold products 30 percent by fiscal 2030.
