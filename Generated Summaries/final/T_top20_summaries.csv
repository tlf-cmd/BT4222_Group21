In 2022, we launched a training course available to all employees, introducing CCI and explaining how AT&T can help customers address climate change. In 2021, we continued expanding CCATs capabilities to generate a holistic climate change risk score for additional segments of our business. We align to relevant industry-specific Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards, the Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and the CDP Climate Change assessment.

Our newly established Connected Climate Initiative includes a collection of technology companies, universities and non-profits working to identify connectivity solutions that can help minimize negative environmental impacts. Physical climate risk is just one consideration in our approach to environmental issues. Key initiatives include: Regular analysis to help ensure our network infrastructure, such as cell sites, data centers and wireline switching offices, can withstand natural disasters High-capacity battery backup or permanent generators at our cell sites, data centersand wireline switching offices, helping ensure service continuity in the event of temporary power loss Proactive monitoring of potential threats to our network, employees and infrastructure through the AT&T Weather Operations Center Considering physical climate risk To help us plan, build and maintain our network in the face of extreme weather and long-term climate change, in 2019 we developed our Climate Change Analysis Tool (CCAT). See page 31 for additional detail on our climate-related efforts. Weve established a Connected Climate Initiative to advance this effort alongside talented business, research and community leaders.

Climate-related strategy, metrics and targets The global transition to a low carbon economy presents risks and opportunities for AT&T and broader society. Our Chief Sustainability Officer leads internal management of AT&Ts environmental and climate-related strategy, risks and opportunities. Internally, weve formed a tiger team with representatives from our CSR and AT&T Business organizations that meets regularly to build AT&T sales team expertise and customer engagement on climate-related issues, recruit new CCI partners and identify opportunities to increase AT&T revenue. Our Senior Vice President (SVP) Audit Services oversees the integration of ESG issues, including environmental and climate-related impacts, into corporate enterprise risk assessment activities. Climate-related oversight and governance The Governance and Policy Committee of the AT&T Board of Directors oversees the entirety of AT&Ts environmental and climate-related strategy, including emissions reduction objectives, consumption of electricity and water, investments in renewable energy, and waste management. To enhance the operational resilience of our network today and help ensure future availability of our services, we integrate climate change considerations throughout our network planning. By modeling the potential for extreme weather within our geographic information system, our industry-leading CCAT helps network engineers analyze how inland and coastal flooding, drought, wind or wildfires may impact existing infrastructure or future network builds up to 30 years into the future. In 2021, we supported more than 200,000 individuals impacted by natural disasters such as Winter Storm Uri, historic California wildfires and the third-busiest hurricane season on record. In addition to ad hoc meetings, the Council held 3 regularly scheduled meetings in 2021, discussing topics such as ESG reporting, digital divide, social innovation, climate transition, political contributions, DE&I, long-range goal setting and social issue engagement. Leadership accountability for carbon neutrality Annual performance objectives for our Chief Sustainability Officer, AVP Global Environmental Sustainability and other senior leaders across our business include progress toward our carbon neutral goal, science-based targets and other climate- related objectives. S. with 5G C-band spectrum by the end of 2023Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather, worsening the risk of physical damage and operational disruptions to our network. For example, our work with the New York Power Authority (NYPA) is exploring the similarities in climate-related risk to utility and telecommunications infrastructure, to help New York State become more resilient to extreme weather."
