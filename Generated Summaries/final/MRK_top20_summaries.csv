S.-based initiativeAlliance for Equity in Cancer Carein 2022 to address persistent disparities across the cancer care continuum and improve the delivery of high-quality, culturally-responsive care in underserved communities. Systematic evaluation to inform product access strategies Embedded within our research and development process, we systematically evaluate our candidates to identify the potential to address significant public health burden and unmet medical needs in underserved health care settings. When a drug or vaccine candidate with the potential to address significant public health burden in underserved health care settings is identified, the access planning process includes engaging all parts of our enterprise, as well as external stakeholders, to identify the most optimal solution. Through charitable grants and employee volunteerism, we support community efforts to improve the health and quality of life for underserved populations. It continues outside our employee base and into communities all over the world, including communities that have historically been underserved or underfunded. Addressing cancer disparity Through a range of collaborations, we are strengthening cancer prevention, care and support systems to help improve health equity in underserved communities. Sometimes the evaluation of a candidate reveals barriers to access inan underserved setting. S. underserved populations, progress on internal efforts is tracked using a key performance indicator dashboard that is reported into an internal Health Equity Steering Committee comprised of senior leaders. We believe our long-standing support of stronger health systems in underserved areas is even more important given the evidence that certain disease patterns are associated with changing climate conditions. Through impact investing, we are able to deploy financial resources in ways that may generate not only improved access to health care for underserved populations, but also financial returns and commercial opportunitiesall while growing a sustainable global health ecosystem and attracting additional capital and partners. For candidates with significant potential in underserved settings, access planning may start in the pre-clinical phase.
