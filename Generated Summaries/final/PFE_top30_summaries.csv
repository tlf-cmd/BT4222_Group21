S. to help address health disparities among historically underserved populations through its Multicultural Health Equity Collective (The Collective). Pfizer colleagues continue to break barriers in the discovery and delivery of treatments and solutions with a relentless focus on providing for underserved and vulnerable communities around the world. Significant improvements in local health systems are still needed in many lower-income countries to ensure broader and better access to care.1 Consistent with Pfizers responsibility to respect the right to health, we are always looking for new ways to tackle this challengenot only by working to assure consistent supply and access to medicines and vaccines, but also by addressing other system barriers that impede progress. To change patients lives, Pfizer applies a modernized approach to access, focused on affordability and delivery for patients with the greatest coverage gaps and out-of-pocket exposure. Pfizer remains committed to helping support the needs of all patients, everywhere. Weve also created two resources to support patients and caregivers this year. It improves both the patient and healthcare professional experience by accelerating program enrollment; providing seamless access to financial support plans; increasing the scale and reach of programs to patients; and allowing the support program journey to be managed directly from their phones. We work with patients and their caregivers to understand their needs and help ensure that our medicines and vaccines work to address them. In the programs first year more than 900,000 people received healthcare services, information or support, including efforts to empower people with health knowledge, increase access to direct health services, and provide patients and communities with stronger social support. Governments, civil society, the private health sector, and communities play a critical role in facilitating access to health innovations by establishing and strengthening local healthcare infrastructure. Patients and Caregivers Patients are our North Star. S. or the European Union to 1.2 billion people in 45 lower-income countries and will work closely with global health leaders to make improvements in diagnosis, education, infrastructure, storage, and more. By working for and with patients, caregivers, and advocates directly, we are able to better understand and serve the evolving needs of patients everywhere. Active collaboration is underway with the Ministries of Health in Malawi, Ghana, and Senegal as well as a number of other Accord-eligible lower-income countries to better understand the critical healthcare needs and opportunities for health system strengthening. This commitment to equitable access extends beyond COVID-19. 18 - 19 Improving Health Literacy for All Patients; pg. For example, we remain committed to working towards equitable and affordable access to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Pfizers oral therapy for people around the world. Because our vaccines and medicines cannot positively impact patients if those patients do not have access to them. These efforts have helped to treat more than six million patients, provide life-saving screening and education for 12.2 million patients, train more than 80,000 healthcare staff and open over 1,000 new health centers. This year, The Pfizer Foundation expanded our partnership with World Vision in Uganda to reduce childhood mortality under age five, by strengthening community-level prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as deploying social accountability models to demand and improve utilization of quality care. Based on this feedback and to better align with unmet patient needs, Pfizer made the decision to significantly expand the offering from the initial patented medicines and vaccines to the full portfolio of medicines for which Pfizer Tackling the Health Equity Gap Together Breaking down barriers with a new collective and holistic approach 1 https://www.who.int/news/item/13-12-2017-world-bank-and-who-half-the-world-lacks-access-to-essential-health-services-100-million-still-pushed-into-extreme-poverty-because-of-health-expenses#:~:text=At%20least%20half%20of%20 the,out%20of%20their%20own%20pockets Vaccine delivery in RwandaImpact Stories Introduction Environment Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report17 Impact Storieshas global rights.

Pfizer was named one of the Worlds Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere.","Design priorities included integration of systems and technologies to increase energy efficiency and enable effective energy demand management. This forecast is based on design efficiencies in space utilization and energy reduction strategies. We look for opportunities to design environmental sustainability attributes into new facility or renovation projects, replace equipment at end of life with energy-efficient alternates, and invest in no / low carbon technologies at our sites and in programs that enable sourcing of clean energy from renewable sources (for example, our North American solar virtual power purchase agreement is described on page 23 of our ESG report). The design includes maximizing the use of natural lighting, reducing lighting power demand 30% below the LEEDv4 baseline, water use management through incorporation of low flow plumbing fixtures, and enabling effective energy management through installation of advanced energy metering and energy performance modeling. The design was informed through identification of the largest energy consuming systems and processes enabling evaluation of opportunities for reduction of electrical and thermal loads. Once operational, we expect Pfizers North American purchased electricity needs, which comprise approximately 50% of our electricity use globally, will be addressed by the renewable energy certificates generated by this solar energy project. For example, we aim to replace equipment at end-of-life with energy-efficient alternatives. Under this 15-year agreement, Vesper will deliver at least 310 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy to the grid from the Hornet Solar project in west Texas. We invest in no- / low-carbon technologies at our sites and through power purchase agreements (PPAs) that enable sourcing of energy from renewable sources.
