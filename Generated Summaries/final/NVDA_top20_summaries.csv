Operational Eco-Efficiency,"Energy efficiency is critical as AI models and HPC applications increase exponentially in size. Data centers were responsible for 54% of our total energy use in FY22, with offices making up the remainder. By the end of the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, we plan to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100%.","To bring a more structured approach to managing energy efficiency at several of our key data center locations, we have an energy management system certified to the ISO 50001 standard. As we expand, were incorporating renewable energy and energy efficiency into the siting and design of new buildings under our ownership, and we consider energy efficiency, renewable energy availability, and other sustainability attributes when evaluating new leased spaces. Energy efficiency is critical as AI models and HPC applications increase exponentially in size. The MLPerf consortium provides an industry benchmark for AI performance and energy efficiency on scientific applications in HPC. Energy conservation measures include white interiors to enhance reflective lighting and controllable high-efficiency LED lighting. Data centers were responsible for 54% of our total energy use in FY22, with offices making up the remainder. 34-3 5 Energy Management in ManufacturingTC-SC-130a.1 Total energy consumed We are a fabless semiconductor company and do not have our own manufacturing facilities. Yet computers consume energy, and so it is imperative that we do so with the greatest possible energy efficiency. By the end of the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, we plan to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers. NVIDIA accelerated computing requires a refactoring of algorithms but delivers orders-of-magnitude better energy efficiency. SOFTWARE OPTIMIZATIONS Software can significantly improve energy efficiency of AI workloads. We develop hardware, software, and networking technology to improve performance and energy efficiency in the data center. If we switched all the CP u-only servers running AI and HPC worldwide to g Pu- accelerated systems, the world could save nearly 12 trillion watt-hours of energy a year, equivalent to the electricity requirements of nearly 1.7 million u . Twenty-three of the worlds top 30 most energy-efficient supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA. NVIDIA g Pus are typically 20x more energy efficient for AI and HPC workloads than CP us. We provide customers insight into server level power efficiency to enable users to run workloads with an optimal balance of performance and power efficiency. By moving to new-generation g Pus, our customers complete their work with lower energy consumption and get results back more quickly. We aim to make every generation of g Pus faster and more energy efficient than its predecessor. Individual g Pus typically have a higher peak active power consumption than CPus, but also complete workloads dramatically faster, so they return to low power idle states quickly and thus consume far less overall energy. We aim to make every new generation of g Pus faster and more energy efficient than its predecessor.

Dynamic Boost 2.0 uses AI to balance power among the CP u, gPu, and g Pu memory, reducing power consumption by about 20-25%. NVIDIA Ampere architecture is up to 20x faster for AI training and inference and up to 7.5x more energy efficient than its previous generation. TC-SC-410a.2 Processor energy efficiency at a system-level for servers, desktops, and laptops Disclosure shall include a discussion of efforts to design for new and emerging usage patterns with respect to energy efficiency in all product categories (i.e., applications for servers, desktops, laptops, workstations, netbooks, tablets, mobile phones, and storage). 12 TRILLION The world could save nearly 12 trillion watt-hours of energy a year by switching CP u-only servers to gPu-accelerated servers for AI and HPC. We estimate energy savings of 20% on N gC workloads because of users implementing performance suggestions from tools like Pytorch Performance Linter, which optimize models and input- output pipelines. In the commercial sector, AI-driven power grid operations and next-generation smart meters are enabling utilities to accelerate the worlds energy transition. A hyperscale data center with NVIDIA g Pus takes up 1/47th of the rack space of the CP u-based systems that it replaces and runs at 93% lower energy cost for AI models. In addition to similarly advanced levels of energy- and water- efficient design, this building features biophilic elements and a shade-providing external trellis that will house 390 kW of solar panels to harness Santa Clara's sunny weather.
