Climate Strategy,Addressing climate change through an entire ecosystem. The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is how rarely a companies record on climate change seems to get in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder or even to factor at all.,"Individual investors who entrust their money to ESG funds of large investment institutions are perhaps unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of companies that make climate change worse, not better. The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is how rarely a companys record on climate change seems to get in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder or even to factor at all. Source: World Resources Institute9 Making an Impact Mission and the Tesla EcosystemAddressing climate change through an entire ecosystem Climate change is reaching alarming levels globally due in large part to emissions from burning fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation. Texas Winter Storm In February 2021, Texas experienced a weather event that caused the widespread loss of power for several days affecting thousands of residents. Kentucky Storms After the Kentucky winter storms, we deployed two systems at a research and education center in Princeton, Kentucky in partnership with the Footprint Project.

Operational Eco-Efficiency,"Tesla considers the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Developments (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiatives A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, and GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Charging a Model 3/Y using solar panels and a Powerwall adds emissions to the manufacturing phase.Using only real- world data, not official NEDC, WLPT or EPA1consumption data. It is possible to fully decarbonize the manufacturing and use of EVs this is economically unfeasible for ICE vehicles. Temporary fleet additions for operational use were categorized as other.","Utilizing renewable energy as much as possible throughout all our operationsWe plan to shift energy consumption toward renewables as quickly as possible throughout our operations, whether it is at our factories, sales, service or delivery locations or through our Supercharger network. Energy Storage Enables 100% Renewables Penetration 120 100 80 60 40 20 0GW Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday 92Pairing energy storage with renewables enables cost -effective decarbonization of the grid The best way to avoid blackouts is to reduce your reliance on the grid. Various efficiency testing cycles such as NEDC, WLTP or EPA do not truly represent real -world fuel or energy consumption. EV customers can increase their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof and an energy storage solution, such as Powerwall, in their homes. Therefore, we used: EV energy consumption: Real world energy consumption based on 25 billion miles traveled Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, including energy losses during the charging process. Ultimately, using renewable energy (such as solar or wind) with battery storage will become the cheapest energy option available, regardless of location. In Massachusetts, for example, we estimate that an average solar and storage system pays for itself with energy cost savings within approximately 10 years. Tesla Cumulative Net Energy Impact: 2012 2021 (TWh) TeslaFigures based on actual electricity consumption from utility bills for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. In order to switch global energy usage to renewable sources, we estimate that global annual battery storage production will need to increase to ~10,000 GWh. Tesla Robotaxis will be even more energy efficient The energy efficiency of T esla vehicles will continue to improve as we improve our technology and powertrain efficiency. Additionally, we want to displace fossil- based energy generation with renewable energy generation. For such comparison, we look at actual energy usage for the HVAC system for the two modes under the same conditions (operations in the factory, time of year, external temperature, etc.). In the early days of Model S production, we were able to achieve energy efficiency of 3.1 EPA miles / kWh. Using only real- world data, not official NEDC, WLPT or EPA1consumption data The most important variable in a lifecycle analysis of an automobile is real- world fuel consumption or electricity consumption, as applicable, which impacts the use -phase of the lifecycle. Energy Efficiency EPA range in miles/kWh OEM data Figures based on estimated EPA range and usable battery capacity disclosures by OEMs for each model. It is our goal to eventually have all our manufacturing energy needs satisfied through renewable sources where possible. On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs has become greener over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid. We conservatively assume no additional renewable energy capacity on the grid during the life of the vehicle given the shape of the renewable energy adoption curve is still very much up for debate. Figures for 2012 -2017 for electricity, and 2012 -2019 for on -site fuel use, are estimated based on actuals scaled for vehicle and battery production for each respective year and facility. In isolation, high energy efficiency is already difficult to achieve, but getting both performance and efficiency is the tricky part. 3 Please see page 137 of the appendix for detailed explanation of energy consumption figures. Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically and almost never reflect real -world data. In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year (compared to 4 GWh in 2021). The new dry -electrode process allows for the direct transition from a cathode or anode powder to an electrode film, reducing energy consumption in the overall cell manufacturing phase by more than 70% based on our latest analysis. Additionally, we are hoping to see more Tesla vehicle customers installing solar panels or Solar Roof along with a Powerwall to meet their own energy needs in a sustainable way. Our focus on energy efficiency achieving superior range from the same size battery has allowed to us continue to increase range while keeping the battery size relatively stable. For reference, that is more energy generated by our installations than the total energy Tesla has used to run all our factories since we began producing Model S in 2012 and electricity used to power all of our vehicles in that same period combined. Transitioning to in -house manufactured 4680 T esla cells, whose production process can reduce energy consumption by more than 70% At Teslas 2020 Battery Day, we presented a novel way that cells can be manufactured using a dry electrode process. In March 2022, Tesla employees in Europe volunteered to design, prototype and deploy the first 50 kits containing Powerwalls, Gateways and solar inverters to support continued energy access in Ukraine. We are striving to always remain a net contributor to renewable energy generation. For each component that requires less movement around the factory, and as we use fewer robots in the vehicle production process, energy consumption declines. S. domestic electricity needs, as well as vehicle transportation needs, could be met by sunlight alone. AI control is expected to achieve significant energy savings for Tesla as it is scaled up to control a majority share of HVAC equipment at Gigafactory Nevada as well as HVAC equipment at other Gigafactories. We have an extensive database of Model 3 residual values and cost of repairs, maintenance, energy use, etc. 2020 and 2021 figures also include measured consumption for on- site fuel use including propane, diesel and gasoline. ICE fuel consumption: Data provided by Consumer Reports, which reports model year 2020 mid -size premium sedans achieve 24.3 MPG on average. In order to reduce the cost of our vehicles and batteries, we also need to use less energy to produce them.

Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly. That said, because combination trucks have high fuel consumption due to their weight and heavy utilization, they account for approximately 18% of all U."
Low Carbon Strategy,"Running costs such as fuel (electricity or gasoline), maintenance, tires and repairs for Model 3 should cost just over half of a mass- market ICE vehicle such as a T oyota Camry. The hotspot analysis found that main drivers of GHG emissions depend on the different battery compositions, processing routes and countries of origin.We plan to shift energy consumption toward renewables as quickly as possible throughout our operations. Creating a battery that could last for 1,000,000 miles (4,000 charging cycles) would dramatically reduce the emissions per mile driven for high -mileage vehicles such as taxis, delivery vans or trucks.","Utilizing renewable energy as much as possible throughout all our operationsWe plan to shift energy consumption toward renewables as quickly as possible throughout our operations, whether it is at our factories, sales, service or delivery locations or through our Supercharger network.

Supply Chain Management,"Tesla is committed to ensuring that companies in our supply chain respect human rights and protect the environment. The Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Responsible Materials Policy outline Teslas expectations for suppliers. Tesla also has an audit program that goes beyond the battery supply chain please see pages 112 - 115.Tesla has a dedicated responsible sourcing program for three priority minerals in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium. The program has achieved several important milestones this last year, including the development and initial implementation of a system to identify environmental and social risks.","111Battery Supply Chain OutlookOutlook for battery supply chain responsible sourcing: Formalization and expansion Teslas battery responsible sourcing program is still relatively new. Re|Source : Tesla participates in the supply chain -wide Re|Source consortium to pilot blockchain -supported traceability in the cobalt supply chain. Furthermore, we continue to leverage our membership with the RBA to identify upcoming supply chain risks as well as understand industry best practices to address them. Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Expansion114 How we identify and prioritize risks in our supply chain Our Supplier Audit program is an important part of our efforts to identify and address environmental and social risks within our supply chain. Battery Supply Chain #1 The Tesla Approach 100The unique T esla approach: Going directly to the source The implementation of an OECD -aligned approach for cobalt, nickel and lithium is underpinned by the following two pillars: 1.Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple processing steps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain are present at mine sites. Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base. This criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the potential to further mitigate risk. We have already started to identify which materials and processes in our supply chain are key emitters so we can prioritize engagement and projects to address these emissions see the Supply Chain section for more detail. Tesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct when identifying risks within our supply chain. Additionally, Tesla utilizes other avenues to evaluate potential risks in our supply chain such as those detailed below. This monitoring allows our Global Supply Managers to be notified as soon as information about suppliers becomes public and act by engaging directly with the supplier to understand their plans for correcting the identified risk. Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Program113Continuing to expand our audit program In 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit program. In addition, we have utilized many of the RBA tools, such as country risk analysis to understand inherent risks in our supply chain and RBA -Online to collect information on corporate and factory -specific supplier performance. 99 -111 Responsible Sourcing & Tesla Supplier Audit ProgramIn 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance evaluation to key environmental, social, and governance metrics relevant to Teslas business. To ensure we are appropriately managing risk, we continue to map our supply chain, conduct in third -party audits and on -the-ground engagements, and collaborate with industry initiatives to ensure our suppliers are living up to our strict standards. Our goal is that where Teslas supply chain touches, local conditions for stakeholders continuously improve as a result of our purchases. As T eslas battery supply chain continues to scale, Tesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to increase . The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk assessment approach, looking at Teslas exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers location. We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing practices within our supply chain that are contradictory to our policies. Based on an initial review, 15 refiners and mine sites in Teslas supply chain disclosed that they conducted an LCA Cross -cutting Across all risk areas identified, TeslaReviewed suppliers audit frameworks to ensure upcoming audits will cover all areas identified above 55 corrective actions agreed to with suppliers related to suppliers environmental and social management processes Expanded environmental and social requirements in supplier contracts, for example related to responsible mining standards, LCAs, GHG emissions footprint disclosure, and transparent and proactive risk disclosure Developed a formal technical collaboration on sustainability with a supplier15 Refiners, smelters and mine sites in Teslas battery supply chain disclosed they conducted an LCA 55 Corrective actions agreed to with suppliers related to their sustainability management processes109Battery Supply Chain #3 Risk Mitigation and Positive ImpactTeslas engagement in the DRC and the Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA) The DRC is an important source of cobalt for Tesla batteries. We engaged with several third -party service providers allowing us to continually monitor our supply chain for emerging issues that may affect our suppliers. First, because the automotive supply chain doesnt have a strong presence on the West Coast of the U. From all the activities listed in this section, Tesla identified six risk areas as well as cross- cutting topics in cobalt, lithium and nickel supply chains for prioritized engagement, described in Step 3, on the next page. Supply chain emissions Prioritizing our supply chain is crucial and we have a lot of work to do to incentivize suppliers to provide energy and emissions data for us to report on. Yet, the program has achieved several important milestones this last year, including the development and initial implementation of a system to identify environmental and social risks in the battery supply chain and concrete progress towards mitigation and improving the situation of stakeholders impacted by Teslas battery supply chain. For another supplier, Tesla participated in the establishment of a committee of independent environmental experts to assess and work with the supplier on environmental risk management. Tesla also reviews suppliers ISO14001 (environmental management) and OHSAS 18001 (occupational health and safety) certification statuses.100% Refiners and mine sites in Teslas cobalt, nickel and lithium supply chains that we directly sourced from underwent or have committed to undergo independent third -party sustainability audits 83% Of all refiners and mine sites in Teslas cobalt, nickel and lithium supply chains underwent, or have committed to undergo, independent third -party sustainability audits103Battery Supply Chain #2 Risk Identification2.2 Continued supply chain mapping Tesla used a newly developed Know -Your -Supplier (KYS) Questionnaire to map our battery supply chain and collect information related to suppliers environmental and social management systems. Tesla also has an audit program that goes beyond the battery supply chain please see pages 112 - 115. As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our Suppler Audit at least once, representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. In addition, Tesla conducted six audits in the battery supply chain tailored to Teslas specific environmental and social requirements, including the OECD guidance and environmental management systems. This means Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into on-the-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report.98 Battery Supply ChainWe have prioritized responsible sourcing activities for cobalt, lithium and nickel given their unique significance to EVs and energy storage. We do this by proactively identifying and addressing potential risks in our supply chains. For all materials used in Tesla products, Tesla requires its suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict -Affected and High -Risk Areas or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Responsible Sourcing of MineralsSuppliers shall adopt a policy and exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the cobalt, tantalum, tin, tungs ten, and gold in the products they manufacture to reasonably assure that they are sourced in a way consistent with the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development ( OECD) Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and High -Risk Areas or an equivalent and recognized due diligence framework.131The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page :Appendix Supply Chain Policies Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct (continued) Management SystemsSuppliers shall adopt or establish a management system with a scope that is related to the content of the Code of Conduct. Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the supplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable time frame. Our initial focus on high -risk suppliers allowed us to cover more than 70% of this group in the first three years of the audit program and gave us an understanding of suppliers to prioritize in an expanded program. It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and social data. We established a responsible sourcing program based on international best practices Our responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral Supply Chains. In cases where such instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be developed immediately, together with the supplier.

Corporate Governance,"The annualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases, our named executive officers incentives are closely aligned with the long -term interests of our stockholders. In 2021, as part of our Impact program, we reviewed the issues and topics most material to Tesla (identified on page 126) and key areas of focus for the Company and mapped them to the most relevant Sustainable Development Goals.Tesla withdrew less water at facilities dedicated to vehicle manufacturing per vehicle produced than the majority of established carmakers. While each automaker may draw their boundaries slightly differently (depending on how vertically integrated they are), according to the latest publicly available figures.","Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive officers incentives are closely aligned with the long -term interests of our stockholders. In order to meet increasingly strict regulatory requirements across the world, OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive EVs. EV vs. Evaluations for promotions also take place annually. Benchmark cross -over SUV premium ICE vehicles include BMW X3, Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Jaguar F -Pace, AR Stelvio , Volvo XC60, Cadillac XT5, Lexus NX and Porsche Macan. Historically, the aim of manufacturers has been to design their vehicles to perform well for a suite of regulatory and consumer tests. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity -based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. In 2021, as part of our Impact program, we reviewed the issues and topics most material to Tesla (identified on page 126) and key areas of focus for the Company and mapped them to the most relevant Sustainable Development Goals:Appendix Teslas Alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 134Appendix Metric / Disclosure / Topic Source(s) Methodology / Definition Vehicle use- phase emissions, which represent 80 -90% of total automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all. Some examples include our decisions to: Manufacture all -electric vehicles (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV components Establish an international network of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so Build Gigafactory 1, the largest lithium -ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their own utility Deploy FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop complete Full Self -Driving capability in the future Compensate our CEO only if other shareholders realize tremendous value These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately, decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies and are a significant reason why the annualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%. While each automaker may draw their boundaries slightly differently (depending on how vertically integrated they are), according to the latest publicly available figures, Tesla withdrew less water at facilities dedicated to vehicle manufacturing per vehicle produced than the majority of established carmakers."
