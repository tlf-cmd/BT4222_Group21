Operational Eco-Efficiency,"LinkedIns updated design and build guidelines call for all-electric kitchens powered by renewable energy, designed to cook over 5,000 meals a day on clean power. Microsoft advocated for increased US R&D in key technologies such as energy storage and direct air capture.Microsoft's strategy to reach carbon negative by 2030 is relatively simple. We will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by improving efficiency, adopting new solutions, and purchasing zero carbon energy. Microsoft is working with WRI to provide partners with access to the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) global climate projections.In the 12 months following SEACEFs investment, Xurya produced 6,765 MWh resulting in 5,800 mtCO 2 avoided .8 Carbon savings. Smart thermostats across SmartRents portfolio in 2020 were 55,000 MWh of energy, 5 .5 million gallons of gasoline equivalent.","Put simply, pursuing unbundled RECs de-linked energy production and consumption in both geography and time, reducing the overall impact. 13 Reported values represent Microsoft's total renewable energy consumption expressed in MWh from on-site, renewable energy credits, and power purchase agreements (PPAs). At our Silicon Valley campus, a solar panel system will offset energy consumption up to 15 percent. A journey towards 100 percent Our initial commitment, set in 2012, was to cover 100 percent of our energy consumption with renewable energy certificates (RECs). For example, by using machine learning to forecast electricity load, we can enable grid-interactive datacenter components, such as batteries for backup power, to participate in ancillary energy markets and stabilize an electric grid with a higher penetration of renewable energy sources. Microsoft procures enough renewable energy to match 100% of its electricity consumption. We pledged to procure enough renewable energy to offset 50 percent of our energy consumption by 2018 and 60 percent in the next decade, and further specified that wed aim to secure new renewable energy in the geography where our offices and datacenters are, bringing a stronger geographic connection between our contracted renewables and our electricity consumption. We achieved our goal that same year by purchasing enough RECs to cover our annual energy consumption. Organizatio ns can optimize energy management and reduce carbon emissions by using predictive monitoring to help manage equipment performance and energy consumption and to explore grid-interactive efficient buildings a nd infrastructure. In the market-based method, we also capture the impact from direct renewable energy and the purchase of unbundled energy attribute certificates (EACs). The system has an estimated annual output of approximately 750,000 kWh/year of electricity, equivalent to about 15 percent of all site energy usage, and is being integrated with on-site battery storage to help reduce peak demand and address any intermittent excess solar generation produced by the array. Currently, energy storage is not deployed at scale, and the grid infrastructure of today is old and inadequate to meet the balancing needs of new renewable energy resources and the integration of net zero carbon resources, nor to the increasing consumption demands of a rapidly electrifying society. We are focused on offering low-emissions usage options such as Energy-saving mode on Xbox, which can reduce power usage during standby mode from 15 W down to 0.52 W, as well as Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will be powered by Azure datacenters running on 100% renewable energy by 2025. Harnessing thermal energy to halve energy consumption on campus In 2021, we unveiled our plans for a new, hyper-efficient thermal energy center for our Puget Sound campus, which utilizes geothermal wells to heat and cool our buildingsresulting in a 50 percent reduction in energy usage compared to the typical utility plant. We are also developing solutions to help organizations reduce and manage emissions and energy consumption, such as through Azure IoT solutions for energy and sustainability. Telework energy consumption is assumed to include workstation/plug-load energy usage, additional lighting and household cooling/heating consumption. Transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy By 2025, we expect to power our datacenters and facilities with 100 percent additional, new renewable energy generation that matches our electricity consumption on an annual basis. Another, AVOB, provides more accurate energy consumption data to office workstations as well as automated mechanisms to optimize energy consumption, enabling up to a 50 percent reduction in energy usage while increasing performance and computer lifespan. 8 Distributed energy resources AutoGrid delivers a suite of distributed energy applications th at allow utilities and energy service providers to deliver clean, flexible power. Like our earlier commitments, this was on an annual basis, requiring us to sign renewable energy offtake agreements to cover our energy needs; simply put, we will match every electron we consume on an annual basis with renewable energy. In a new effort, we are building tools for AI developers to predict the energy consumption of a neural network before deployment, so that more compute - and energy-efficient networks can be designed upf ront. Replace with 100/100/0 carbon free energy By 2030, 100 percent of our electricity consumption will be matched by zero carbon energy purchases 100 percent of the time. Replacing with 100/100/0 carbon free energy By 2030, 100 percent of our electricity consumption will be matched by zero carbon energy purchases 100 percent of the time. The percentage renewable electricity is calculated as total renewable energy consumption in megawatt hours div ided by total electricity consumption (as disclosed in Disclosure 302-1(c)(i) Electricity consumption from the GRI Standard: 302 Energy 2016). We are changing the w ay we build and operate facilities, using all-elect ric efficient system designs like the use of geothermal ene rgy and thermal energy recovery, and improving th e efficiency of our cloud.

Information Security Cybersecurity & System Availability,Data providers are eager to make their data more accessible for environmental sustainability use cases. Data that exists in the cloud has a huge advantage over data that must be first downloaded on a users system. Getting data to the cloud is the only way to scale the work of a broad range of users. Planetary Computer private preview released as planned in April 2021. More than 500 users signed up and using the APIs and scalable compute. Microsoft plans to implement the mailback program in 40 countries by the end of FY22.,"Their operating system is built on Microsoft Azure, ensuring data and model security, as well as scale. Working with Atturra and Microsoft, DAWE created a digital platform using Dynamics 365 to streamline the application process for both exporters and department personnel while keeping data secure and private. This year, our platform has facilitated 200 projects from more than 1,000 employee hackers, with projects ranging from digital foresting, to smart bird feeders, to building software that will help retrofit the worlds coal power plant fleet with modular nuclear reactors. For a selection of the specified information included in Appendix D, we performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations, compared the specified information to underlying records, or observed the data collection process. Users need to search the vast amount of data available to find the data they need and have easy access to data in the areas and times they care about. Data that exists in the cloud has a huge advantage over data that must be first downloaded on a users system. It is designed to streamline the process for organizations to collect data, analyze data, and turn data into insigh ts. All the information is publicly disclosed at a control panel. We have built Circular Centers inside our large datacenter campuses to intercept and process all decommissioned assets. 1 Make publishing and using spatial data in the cloud simple We are developing features in the Planetary Computer that will make it easy to push data to the cloud and open access to some or all users.
