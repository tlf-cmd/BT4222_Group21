Enterprise Risk Committee The ERC oversees the Corporations Risk Framework, risk appetite and senior managements responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks facing the Corporation. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. GRM is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed. These risks may impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrowers current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. These loans are actively managed and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may be mitigated through the use of derivatives. Given that models are used across the Corporation, model risk impacts all risk types including credit, market and operational risks. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institutions unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. In periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $9.0 billion and $2.6 billion.

The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Mortgage Risk Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of Bank of America.

Our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. In addition to the above judgments and estimates, the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in our commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a primary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all of which have some degree of uncertainty. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Commercial Loans Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporations loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. As of December 31, 2022, the Corporation had 40,399 loans with a book value of $11.8 billion in 100-year flood zones according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) definition. We account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate managements best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk Liquidity Stress Analysis on page 103. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. 154 Bank of America 2022 Other Risk Management Derivatives Other risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures by economically hedging various assets and liabilities. Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporations non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. Transition risks may amplify credit risk through the financial impacts of changes in policy, technology or the market on the Corporation or its counterparties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by any of these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including global socio-demographic and economic trends, energy prices, technological innovations and advances, climate-related conditions and weather events, legislative and regulatory changes, public policies, engagement with clients, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders and other unforeseen events or conditions, as well as the uncertainties and risks discussed in Bank of America Corporations 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings."

Corporate Governance,"The Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain situations (e .g ., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in market making and similar activities.The Corporation determines the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement. At December31, 2022 and 2021, excludes $1.9 billion and $1 .7 billion of certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent)The balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities.","For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable market-based pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. If these market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. A significant increase in price would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value for long positions, and short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporations internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Under applicable accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. The Corporation determines the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement. Win in the market, no excuses. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. (3) The retained senior securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs, such as volatility or implied yield, may be determined using quantitative-based extrapolations, pricing models or other internal methodologies which incorporate management estimates and available market information. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus qualifying observable price changes. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 21 Fair Value Option . Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets. Nonrecurring Fair Value The Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring. Trading account assets also includes certain commodities inventory of $40 million that is accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the current selling price less any costs to sell. the fair value option. The Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy. (2) Includes certain out-of-the-money purchased options that have a liability amount primarily due to the deferral of the option premiums to the end of the contract. Trading account assets also includes certain commodities inventory of $752 million that is accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the current selling price less any costs to sell. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. This provides us a competitive edge to attract the best new teammates to serve our clients and retain them once theyve joined the team. The Corporation accounts for certain resale and repurchase agreements under the fair value option. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other income.
