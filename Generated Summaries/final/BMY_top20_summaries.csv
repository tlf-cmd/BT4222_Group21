Our EHS management system and our occupational health manual outline the regulatory and company requirements that underpin our operations globally. At BMS, we strive to ensure that operations at our facilities are both environmentally responsible and protective of personal and public health and safety, starting by designing clean and efficient manufacturing processes, and routinely assessing existing facility operations. Integrating universal design In alignment with our commitment to employee health, safety and wellness, BMS has committed to the adoption of universal design to help ensure our buildings are accessible. Regulations and standards Our sector is one of the most highly regulated industries because human health and lives are at stake. We are on a journey to create a best-in-class environment, health, safety, sustainability and wellbeing program that is scientifically sound and forward leaning. Allies are not trained therapists and do not diagnose mental health illness. As a company driven by science, we understand that human health is inextricably linked to the health of the planet, therefore we consider environmental responsibility to be imperative for doing business and expanding health equity around theworld. Accordingly, our governance model links core business considerations with our ESG framework and ensures engagement and alignment from BMS most senior leaders, with core support from key functional areas such as Corporate Affairs and Legal, including Environment, Occupational Health, Safety and Sustainability (EOHSS) and is integrated into our enterprise risk management (ERM) program as described below. As part of the Mental Health First Aid program from Mental Health First Aid International , allies are trained to identify, understand and respond to signs of mental distress, illness and addiction issues. We introduced BMS Mental Health Ally, a volunteer-led program that seeks to destigmatize and normalize conversations around mental health and promote the successful management of mental wellbeing. We also collaborate with the public, along with government, industry and educational organizations, to support regulations, research and programs that address environmental, health and safety concerns throughout our industry.

Around the globe, we promote health equity and seek to improve health outcomes for populations disproportionately affected by serious diseases. BMSapproach to wellbeing transcends the traditional wellness profilefocusing on the confluence of emotional, financial and physical wellbeing. These results indicate that we are creating an environment of trust and psychological safety where employees feel they can disclose the full spectrum of their identity at BMS. We establish safe discharge concentrations for our internal/external manufacturing processes that assess potential environmental impacts, and identify ways to minimize any potential environmental or human health impacts from discharge.

Despite the impacts of COVID-19, in 2021, we continued to find ways to drive efficiency through internally run virtual treasure hunt eventsefforts that led us to implement 24 energy and water reduction measures across the portfolio. In 2021, our facilities took action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increase energy efficiency and reduce waste and water usein line with our 2030 and 2040 environmental goals.

In 2022, we expect to continue our commitment to sustainability with further reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, such as with the transition from RKN active shipping containers to thermal blankets, potentially saving up to 25kg of CO 2e per insulated pallet, as well as landfill waste reductions.2021 Highlights Reduced CO 2 emissions by 33% with the implementation of new shipping containers in two key shipping lanes 100% reduction in Sulphur Oxide, 91% reduction in Nitrogen Oxide, and 29% reduction in Carbon Dioxide through the conversion of barges to ocean vessels powered by Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) between the U. 2021 ESG REPORT | 47Embracing clean and renewable energy BMS currently manages an on-site EV charging network consisting of 155 EV charging points and more than 500 subscribers across 10 U. These goals include achieving a 10% reduction in our energy use and GHG emissions intensity, a 25% reduction in waste to landfill and a 5% reduction in water intensity. Most notably, 12 HVAC projects have been implemented across the network for which we are anticipating a reduction of over 1,154.4 mtons CO 2e annually. We procure green electricity via electric supply contracts in local markets in Ireland, Germany and California in the U. Our aim is to follow the science and creatively apply technology and our know-how to solve tough business problems of diminishing resources, carbon emissions, energy consumption and waste generation. Doing so presents opportunities to expand our overall positive impact, as our Scope 3 emissions can be a partnering companys Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions.
