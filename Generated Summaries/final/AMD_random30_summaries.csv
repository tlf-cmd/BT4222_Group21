Supply Chain Management,"The scope of the AMD Supply Chain Responsibility program encompasses the manufacturing of our products by suppliers, located in Asia, Europe and the United States. The majority of audits took place in the region where we have the highest number of suppliers, Greater China. Through our annual analysis, we gain deeper insights into inherent geographical risks in our supply chain.Each year, AMD works with our suppliers to identify the relevant smelters and refiners within our supply chain. Between 2020 and 2021, 64 percent of these supplier factories had an RBA audit. 80% ofAMDmanufacturing suppliers by spend to participate in a capacity - building activity by 2025.","We have expanded our program beyond 3TG and cobalt, and we continue to identify opportunities to work proactively to map our supply chain and prioritize risk mitigation actions. We encourage our supply chain to utilize RMI tools and best practices to ensure industry alignment across the value chain. Of all NCs in our supply chain in 2021, six Priority NCs were identified (up from two in 2020), representing 6 percent of all NCs during this time frame. We utilize third -party risk analytics to conduct an overall supply chain risk analysis. 37 Data reflects initial and closure audits in the AMD supply chain that took place in the 2021 calendar year up to December 31, 2021. Read our RBA commitment letter How We Engage With Industry Groups Risk Assessment At AMD, we take a risk -based approach to managing our supply chain. We also collaborate on industry efforts to advance sub -tier supplier mapping in order to identify and address risks further down the supply chain. Supply chain due diligence is an ongoing process. Additionally, 81 percent of AMD supplier manufacturing factories were eligible for the VAP Recognition Program , which means the RBA recognized them for their 60 [Public] commitment to soci al and environmental responsibility.42 At the end of 2021, the top 70 percent of all suppliers in our supply chain, by spend, have the highest level of VAP recognition status. AMD shares best practices in corporate responsibility to help inform upstream and downstream enterprises in the industrial supply chain. Through RMI, we connect with industry members, governments, non-profits and other stakeholders to contribute to mitigate the salient social and environmental impacts of the extraction and processing of minerals used in supply chains. As we learn more about potential social and environmental impacts, we continue to assess our supply chain and have priorit ized minerals for additional due diligence. The RBA Code is reviewed and updated every three years by RBA members and stakeholders to ensure its applicability to international norms and relevant supply chain issues. Our Approach Our approach is based on the five steps of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict -Affected and High -Risk Areas (OECD Guidance). As AMD outsourced manufacturing operations, we expanded the scope of our environmental initiatives and goals beyond our global operations to include supply chain manufactur ing. As a result, new suppliers are being incorporated into the AMD Supply Chain R esponsibility Program, and we continue to take steps to further operationalize our Human Rights Policy. This concentration of supplier spend allows us to take a long -term approach with key suppliers, which is paramount to our success. In addition, we collaborate with other industry groups, peers, suppliers and other stakeholders to make supply chains across the industry ethical and sustainable. We encourage our suppliers to utilize RMI tools and best practices to ensure industry alignment across the value chain. In 2021, 32 initial VAP audits were conducted at manufacturing supplier and sub -tier supplier factories in the AMD supply chain. In 2021, 66 percent o f all NCs in our supply chain were classified as Major NCs.

Although we adhere to the highest standards, we know the social and environmental risks in the supply chain are persistent and real. The score is an additional input used to assign a risk level to the supplier. Its accomplishments and our work together help to advance AMD supply chain goals. Our view and insight into the minerals supply chain have developed beyond 3TG to include cobalt. Accountability We use supplier scorecards to hold suppliers accountable for their perform ance against AMD supply chain responsibility expectations. When priority nonconformances are found, AMD contacts the supplier and requests details on the actions the site is implementing to immediately address the nonconformance (NC) prior to creating the longer -term CAP. We believe this industry -wide standard is an efficient and effective way to integrate social, environmental and ethical responsibilities into our supply chain. For this reason, multi -stakehol der partnerships are an important aspect of managing our supply chain responsibility. 8) 80% ofAMDmanufacturing suppliers by spend to participate in a capacity - building activity by 2025.6 7) ON TRACK: Between 2020 and 2021, 64 percent of these supplier factories had an RBA audit.
