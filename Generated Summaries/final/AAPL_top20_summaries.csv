Labor and human rights risks in the supply chain: Discrimination risks in workforce management and in product and services development.Our goal is to one day make products using only responsibly sourced recycled and renewable materials. Delivering exceptional products that enrich the lives of our customers is core to Apples business. Using safer chemistry in our products also enables recycling and material recovery.,"These and other innovations helped us increase our use of recycled or renewable content to 18 percent of all the material shipped in products in fiscal year 2021.7Product longevity We want to make the most of the materials we use through designing long-lasting products. Within resources, we focus on three main areas of impact: Materials: Transitioning to only recycled or renewable materials in our products and packaging, and maximizing material efficiency, product longevity, and recovery. Were on an ambitious journey to one day make our products using only recycled or renewable materials. And by building our products to serve more than one owner and encouraging customers to exchange devices for an upgrade, we extend the life of our products. Thats why were focusing on three different levers to reduce our footprint and achieve circularity: sourcing and efficiency; product longevity; and product end-of-life. The results drive product design improvements and manufacturing process controls. Innovation: Drive the development and use of innovative materials that enable the creation of groundbreaking products and also support industrywide change.

Every aspect of our products is thoroughly assessed by engineers in our Reliability Testing Lab who measure the performance of materials, components, and fully assembled products. Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 20Assessment and management The data we collect on chemicals and materials forms the foundation for key decisions that have an impact on our product designs, manufacturing processes, and approach to recycling and reuse. And were also seeking to redefine the overall resource footprint of our products. Using safer chemistry in our products also enables recycling and material recovery, so that our products can be the raw materials for the next generation. Our goal is to one day make products using only responsibly sourced recycled and renewable materials. Our approach Delivering exceptional products that enrich the lives of our customers is core to Apples business. We believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apples success as making the best products in the world. Through our work in this area, were reducing the need to mine new materials and the amount of energy needed to manufacture new products, ultimately driving down emissions and conserving resources. We work to provide positive customer experiences as well as products that are durable and can be used for years to come. Then we look at how our products are manufactured. For example, Apple published articles to make sure customers with potential skin sensitivities understand what materials are used in our wearable products. Low-carbon design To reduce the carbon footprint of our products, were increasing efficiency and transitioning to materials from recycled sources and those made using low-carbon energy. Upholding our values from the start We work across our business to implement our standards from the earliest stages of product design and development from the suppliers we choose to work with, to the materials in our products, to the processes and equipment we use to make them. As we make progress toward our goal to use only recycled and renewable minerals and materials in our products and packaging, we continue to source primary materials including tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG), and other minerals, such as cobalt responsibly, while working to improve conditions in and around mining communities. And today, nearly 20 percent of the materials in our products were made from recycled content a number were working toincrease. Extending the life of products and parts through refurbishment and reuse We can lower the impact each device has on the environment including carbon intensity per year of life by finding ways to refurbish and reuse these products. * Low-carbon materials represents emissions savings from transitioning to recycled materials in our products, or use of low-carbon aluminum, as described on page 18. We continue to design our products with features that enhance repairability and durability. And when we design our products, were focused on making them safe for anyone who assembles, uses, or recycles them. Materials We aim to make the best use of the materials we rely on to make our products. Apple is committed to helping customers understand how to safely use Apple products. We take a comprehensive approach to identifying and mitigating risks early Design & engineering LogisticsPrimary materials Final assembly Retail storesSmelter & refiner ComponentsServicesServicesRecyclingA global network of people and businesses working together to build the best products in the world.

Our Trade In program extends to 25 countries, providing customers with options for product end-of-life to access the value of their current device if they want to upgrade to a newer model, or to recycle their devices for free. Our retail teams inspire our customers to discover, learn about, and choose Apple products, services, and accessories by delivering a personalized experience like no other. In fiscal year 2021, Apple avoided 180,000 metric tons of CO 2e by shifting the mode of transport and reducing product weight through the removal of the power adapter from the box of iPhone devices. In 99 percent of the countries where we sell products, we continue to provide and participate in product take-back and recycling collection programs. For example, we recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our products are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid emission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. Product longevity We believe long-lasting products are best for the environment. We design our products with this goal in mind."

Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated cumulatively since 2012. Energy efficiency: We will increase energy efficiency at our facilities and in our supply chain by finding opportunities, such as retrofitting, to reduce energy use. Energy savings from supplier energy efficiency improvements are reported as annualized annual numbers. We also recognize that energy use at our employees homes likely increased during this period. These savings are not included in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives. We launched our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program in 2015 with the goal of helping suppliers optimize their facilities and operations to use as little energy as possible. All efficiency measures are retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the California Energy Commission. Product energy use accounts for 22 percent of our gross carbon footprint and has an impact on the individual energy use of each of our customers. Apex also provides limited assurance of scope 3 renewable energy production and avoided carbon emissions related to our Supplier Clean Energy Program as well as energy savings associated with our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program.

The projects online today will support greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to removing 3 million cars from the road for one year. Weve focused our efforts to source renewables around several key pillars: creating new renewable energy projects, undertaking projects that deliver clear benefits to local communities, and supporting renewable energy innovations. For example, in January 2022, Apple, along with other leading companies, filed an amicus brief in support of the EPAs authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions because that authority is critical to combatting climate change. In April 2021, we made a public statement calling for mandatory disclosures of global greenhouse gases across all emissions scopes. About 1.5 gigawatts of Apple-created renewable electricity projects account for over 90 percent of the renewable electricity our facilities use. Prior to 2020, supplier energy savings are calculated on a calendar year basis. As we worked with our partners to identify new renewable energy projects for our Power for Impact program, we saw exciting potential in this community. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate facilities energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate controls due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. For example, last October we announced that we will be working with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, formed by six Sioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources, on a project to create a wind power development in the Midwest. Many people had been using battery-powered lanterns because upfront costs and other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach. prioritized the use of aluminum smelted using low-carbon sources of electricity rather than fossil fuels for a lower carbon impact. In May 2021, Apple also became one of the first companies to voice support for the enactment of the Clean Energy Standard (CES) that would decarbonize the power grid by 2035. Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions related to our products, calculated using life cycle assessment, are checked for quality and accuracy by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany in accordance with the internationally recognized ISO 14000 environmental management standards: ISO 14040 and 14044. Ultimately, DC GO developed a pay-as-you-go model that brought solar energy to 3500 homes that previously lacked access. Supply chain renewable electricity capacity (operational) and renewable electricity use for FY2021 do not include REC purchases Apple made, equivalent to 0.3 GW and 500,000 MWh, respectively, to address a small increase to its carbon footprint.
