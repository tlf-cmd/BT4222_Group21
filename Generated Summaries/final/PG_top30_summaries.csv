Product Stewardship,"P&G is working to design all our consumer packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2030. We nearly doubled our use of recycled plastic over the past two years. In 2021/2022, we diverted nearly 675,000 metric tons of manufacturing waste from the landfill.Tide to Go Pens and Wipes have also completed testing aboard the ISS to understand the cleaning power of the brands ingredients in microgravity. P&G aims to incorporate more recycled plastic in our packaging to reduce our reliance on virgin plastic.","P&Gs Climate Transition Action Plan covers the entire lifecycle emissions of our products and packaging, across supply chain, operations, consumer use of our products, and product end of life. At P&G, we are working to design all our consumer packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2030. In the sourcing of our paper products, for every tree used, at least two are regrown. It delights consumers with its ease of opening, appearance at shelf and full recyclability. 1 This designation is the result of enrolling the full plastics recycling value chain to work together and increase the rate of recycling on this resin which is widely used in packaging and finished goods. Im so proud how we immediately helped, while simultaneously working to safely resume our operations and continue serving people across the region who depend on our products every day. However, the quality of post-recycled resin does not always meet our high material standards for quality and product protection. In the past year, P&G has responded to more than 30 disasters across the globe with financial support, products and services to meet these unexpected needs. To track progress toward our goals, P&G considers packaging to be recyclable if there is at-scale collection, sorting, processing, and end markets for the material and format in at least one geography. GOALS PROGRESS through June 30, 2022 100% of our consumer packaging will be designed to be recyclable or reusable by 2030~79% of our consumer packaging is designed to be recyclable or reusable Reduce our use of virgin petroleum plastic in our consumer packaging by 50% by 2030 vs. 2017 baseline~8% reduction of virgin petroleum plastic in packaging Zero manufacturing waste to landfill Achieved and maintained since 2020 Progre ss to 100% Recyclable or Reusable Packaging FY20/21 FY19/20FY21/22 73% 55%79%Types of Resin Used in Packaging PE (48.3%) PET (23.2%)PP (22.4%) Other (6.2%) We nearly doubled our use of recycled plastic over the past two years In 2021/2022, we diverted nearly 675,000 metric tons of manufacturing waste from the landfill which is heavier than 66 EIFFEL TOWERS Data and Metrics: Plastics Packaging Tons of plastic packaging 776,220 metric tons Tons of recycled plastic resin 96,469 metric tons Percent of total resin used that was recycled12.4% recycled resin 27ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY INTRODUCTION COMMUNITY IMPACT EQUALITY & INCLUSION ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ETHICS & CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY RECOGNITIONS & AWARDS Reducing Plastic Packaging Gillette and Venus undertook a sustainable packaging upgrade to transition premium refillable razor packs to a plastic-free, recyclable cardboard box made with at least 50% recycled materials and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper. This industry collaboration recently led to the upgrading of polypropylene rigid containers as Widely Recyclable by the How2Recycle program (effective July 2022). We are continuing to create products that encourage responsible consumption, reduce our manufacturing footprint, and strive for more circular approaches in our supply chain. In business, we can help change the world just by being thoughtful about the innovations we prioritize, the materials we use, and the partners we work with every day. Tide to Go Pens and Wipes have also completed testing aboard the ISS to understand the cleaning power of the brands ingredients in microgravity. People increasingly rely on us to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable. One of the critical goals of Responsible Beauty is ensuring the responsible sourcing of priority ingredients of natural origin, including 100% RSPO certified palm oil/kernel oil and derivatives, by 2022. Our efforts to advance the state of recycling through innovation paired with external collaborations via licensing and supporting industry-wide efforts are truly advancing the circularity and reuse of plastic resins. Together, with our trusted brands we bring groundbreaking innovations to benefit consumers around the world and grow our business. By taking a closer look at our Scope 3 emissions, we now know that ~10% of our ingredients (which equates to ~500 individual ingredients) account for ~90% of our supply chain emissions, which allows us to focus where we can drive the most change and advance better solutions. This more sustainable box is now available in every P&G region globally. 1 50% more cleaning ingredients vs. Through these actions, we are making progress on our journey to make our brands, products and content accessible to all. This ranges from the design of our organizational structure and leadership culture to our daily commitment to operational discipline, which impacts every action and decision that our employees takefrom sourcing quality, safe and ethically produced ingredients to distributing products that prioritize safety, transparency and well-being. P&Gs Ambition 2030 supports our brands ability to provide irresistible superiority that is sustainable to improve lives now and for generations to come. P&G Beauty realized these consumers werent fully enjoying the products and content that we offered and decided to act on it. We estimate this exterior packaging change saves the plastic equivalent of more than 85 million water bottles per year (based on 2020 sales volumes for North America and select Europe markets). Breakthrough Innovation and Partnership Toward Circular Plastic P&G aims to incorporate more recycled plastic in our packaging to reduce our reliance on virgin plastic and ensure that existing materials are better utilized. P&G is also a proud supporter of The Recycling Partnerships Polypropylene Recycling Coalition. Ezgi Company Communications I enjoy collaborating with impassioned individuals to create sustainable innovation that drives growth and will influence the entire CPG industry. Our corporate R&D teams developed a process to drastically improve the quality of recycled polypropylene (PP) plastic. This P&G process, VersoVita, takes nearly all the imperfections out of the resin and returns it to near-virgin quality. Out of these efforts Family Care also achieved 75% FSC certified wood pulp, our preferred certification Paper Packaging 2Progress 100% of our paper packaging to be either recycled or third-party certified virgin content>99% recycled or third-party certified 50% of our virgin paper packaging is FSC certified by 2025 Achieved68% FSC certified 1 Palm Oil, Palm Oil Derivatives, Palm Kernel Oil, Palm Kernel Oil Derivatives. This plastic resin accounts for roughly 20% of the plastic used in our packaging and has the potential to significantly increase our use of recycled content. The first prototype, Tide Infinity, was sent to the International Space Station (ISS) for testing in December 2021 in collaboration with NASA and the ISS National Laboratory. Supplies of FSC wood fiber are limited, yet our paper businesses set a bold goal to achieve over 75% FSC certification by 2025, with a 2030 ambition of 100% FSC. 37ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY INTRODUCTION COMMUNITY IMPACT EQUALITY & INCLUSION ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ETHICS & CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY RECOGNITIONS & AWARDS P&G and Solvay Join Forces in Industry-leading Effort to Double the Global Supply of Sustainable Guar Farmed in India Guar is a natural ingredient with many uses in personal care products like shampoos and lotions."
