By having suppliers build their capabilities across human resources and health and safety, we see more long-term, positive impacts on workers. 8 Healthy and safe workplaces: Supplier must reach Level 3 safety and health maturity on Culture of Safety Maturity Assessment (CoSMA). We launched a centralized global chemical management system to provide our employees with electronic access to Safety Data Sheets, and to recognize, evaluate and address occupational health and safety risks associated with chemicals and materials. From this relationship, NIKE developed a workplace safety facilitator program to develop soft skills so workers, managers and leaders can deliver peer-to-peer safety conversations on fire safety as well as other safety topics. We have since stabilized our workforce and are seeing a downward injury trend that we expect to continue. 77 Air MI injury rate was influenced by COVID-19 with interruptions in work, adjustments to manufacturing process and the addition of hundreds of temporary workers to augment the workforce. Over five years, we have defined a roadmap for achieving world-class safety performance, tested and piloted programs to create advanced health and safety management systems, and developed new tools to measure individual competencies and leadership capabilities that enable a mature health and safety culture in the workplace. Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Health & SafetyTransformational Leadership With the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), we have successfully piloted an enterprise-level program with our largest supplier groups to help their company leaders evaluate and improve the effectiveness of existing safety governance structure and safety leadership. 71 The reported injury rates reflect a combination of NIKE full-time and certain external temporary workers. Focus Area HEALTH & SAFETY % suppliers with Level 3 health & safety maturity30 Target 100% FY2127% 22% FY20 30 Healthy and safe workplaces: Supplier must reach level 3 safety and health maturity on Culture of Safety Maturity Assessment (COSMA). In FY21, we began discussion with the International Labour Organization (ILO)s Vision Zero Fund (VZF), seeking a deeper understanding of its vision, mission and strategy, which focuses on eliminating severe or fatal work-related accidents, injuries and diseases in global supply chains. Fostering a Culture of Health & Safety We believe effective leaders set the ethical tone for the company, hold themselves accountable for safety performance, drive safe behaviors at work and motivate their colleagues to do the same. The SSC workstreams, including transformational leadership in health and safety, come to life through the factory group leaders. The program is aimed at enterprise-level leaders and governing bodies that are accountable for the strategic direction and oversight of health and safety of their organization. Healthy and safety in the supply chain Worker health and safety practices throughout the supply chain. Despite the global pandemic, NIKE maintained its focus on new facility construction and existing renovation efforts across the globe while maintaining world-class low injury rates. Each industry classification (such as DC, Air Manufacturing Innovation (Air MI), Offices, Footwear Manufacturing, Apparel Manufacturing) reports a separate average for recordable injuries and lost time rates (which are captured). In addition, we also supported Better Work in its delivery of several trainings to the workers of suppliers, in order to enhance a higher degree of psychological well-being, mental health and improved workplace communication. When I first started running, the so-called experts believed that if a woman ran more than a mile, shed do bodily harm. The data is validated by worker voice, through a safety perception survey, though COVID-19 headwinds and travel restrictions have limited our ability to validate progress onsite. We have found that a safe and healthy workplace and working hours are the leading causes of supplier gaps against our Code and CLS in manufacturing and initial assessments in distribution centers are beginning to surface environmental, labor, health and safety issues. We do this by adopting, refining and standardizing industry-leading safety management systems and rules and by developing education, training and certification programs, and safety leadership capabilities. Continued socialization and launch of our global office safety program, as well as our global building and construction safety program, will continue across our key cities. Machine Safety Certifications As we modernize our mode of manufacturing, improving suppliers capabilities to operate and maintain modern and automated machinery continues to be a top health and safety priority. NIKE Owned or Operated Manufacturing Facilities (Air MI) We continued to invest in comprehensive safety program upgrades and management systems, formalizing a safety steering committee and governance, investing in upgraded machine-specific lock-out and tag-out procedures, and formally separating pedestrians from mobile equipment in our facilities. Lyra Health We launched a new engagement with Lyra Health to provide mental health support for our employees in the U."

We take the same innovative approach to reducing impact across our entire value chain from the way we manufacture and distribute products to the way we operate our offices, stores and distribution centers. Additionally, the use of higher carbon-intensive materials in footwear (such as leather) combined with increasing material use per product has also spurred much of the emissions growth. Progress was driven by our focus on foundational polyester- based materials that cut across our product portfolio, such as laces, linings and reinforcements. We are teaming with other industry leaders to research options to replace apparel polybags with a more sustainable, non-plastic alternative. NIKE product creation is focused on meeting these goals. The course focused on advanced learning and development education, networking and hands- on experience in global design and product creation and was supported by a team of 20 Converse designers, managers and peers. Progress will be gradual until these programs are in place for future products. Due to system upgrades, some key product efficiency data was unavailable in FY21. Because chemistry is essential in all materials and products, it is also essential that we take a responsible, proactive role in managing our chemical footprint. The majority of cotton and polyester volume data is sourced using direct measurements, though product creation data is used to estimate material volumes for certain parts of the business. Focus suppliers represent key suppliers involved in the dyeing and/or finishing of materials, which directly support footwear and apparel finished product assembly.

We are teaming with other industry leaders to research options to replace apparel polybags with a more sustainable, non-plastic alternative. NIKE product creation is focused on meeting these goals. The course focused on advanced learning and development education, networking and hands- on experience in global design and product creation and was supported by a team of 20 Converse designers, managers and peers. Progress will be gradual until these programs are in place for future products. Due to system upgrades, some key product efficiency data was unavailable in FY21. Because chemistry is essential in all materials and products, it is also essential that we take a responsible, proactive role in managing our chemical footprint. The majority of cotton and polyester volume data is sourced using direct measurements, though product creation data is used to estimate material volumes for certain parts of the business. Focus suppliers represent key suppliers involved in the dyeing and/or finishing of materials, which directly support footwear and apparel finished product assembly.

From raw-material processing to product creation to new methods of make, chemistry lets us innovate and influence design, performance and sustainability throughout the value chain. Removing PFC-based finishes, especially in high-performance materials, requires product- by-product optimization and involves teams across the product creation process. Product design and circularity Designing products, packaging and processes for durability, reuse, recycling and circularity. By tapping into the insights and experience of at least the past five years, we are focusing on improving the environmental impact of materials within our products. Innovation will be increasingly important, focusing on new recycling methods and material types that meet our product and consumer requirements. Were focused on using recycled materials, creating more durable materials, using better chemistry and making products that are easier to refurbish or recycle. Demand creation: Business development activities to create market demand for Nike Grind materials including rubber, foam, leather and textile blends from manufacturing scrap and end-of-life shoes across NIKE product creation teams and with external global companies. Now more than ever, engaging and valuing the people who make our products is critical. We aim to move to high-recycled percentage formulations that maintain material benefits while lowering environmental impact. NIKE is also reducing the weight of the shipping cartons utilized to ship product globally from footwear suppliers by 24%. The impact of each individual product differs considerably, based on its profile, materials used, size and weight, method of manufacture, and location of production, use and disposal. This was the next evolution in digital packaging improvement after a 50% reduction in our total outbound digital packaging versus the original design we offered two years ago. NPEO-free recycling processes: While critical to advancing circularity, the use and reuse of materials from outside our typical supply chain presents challenges for ensuring chemical constituents in the product. This included: Participating in the GRI Business Leadership Forum on the new GRI 306 Waste Standard Reviewing waste-related terms and definitions across a wide range of external standards and legislation governing corporate impact reporting and product marketing claims in our industry and across other industries Reviewing the boundaries of our waste accounting system to begin preparing for the multi-year process of developing 2030 targets Updating our internal Scrap Material Guide Our objective is to continuously improve our foundation for measuring and communicating what matters in a way that accurately characterizes reality, is credible and trustworthy, enables NIKE to understand and take appropriate responsibility for the impacts associated with making our products, and is meaningful to stakeholders.

""Many, if not all, of these issues are interconnected, with management of our top issues being dependent on how we manage other issues,"" it adds.","In March 2021, NIKE participated in the VZF inaugural high-level forum, and we look to expand our relationship and collaboration with VZF , which we feel will help accelerate our compliance strategy and mitigate systemic high-risk issues with suppliers. Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Foundational ExpectationsExperience has taught us that without a systemic approach to remediation of issues, improvements are often temporary, and these issues resurface in future years. Since FY19, we have been working to make systemic changes across NIKE to achieve our SBTs, the impact of which we will be realized in the coming years. Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Health & SafetyWorkplace Safety Facilitators NIKE requires Tier 1 and strategic Tier 2 suppliers to adopt fire prevention and emergency action plans for the protection of workers during normal working operations and emergency situations. The CRS&G Committee oversees both the risks and the opportunities associated with purpose. GRM identifies and evaluates risks to NIKE, Inc., including those related to purpose, as part of its risk assessment process. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in our reports filed with the U. Crisis Text Line NIKE supports Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit that provides free 24/7 crisis counseling via text messaging. The process evaluates the risks of starting a relationship within a requested country and requires additional approval for locations in countries identified as high risk. The committee oversees both the opportunities and risks associated with NIKEs three purpose pillars people, planet and play. This process then informs GRMs audit and risk plan and how GRM deploys risk management services across NIKE, Inc. This includes strengthening our standards and expectations, identifying risks, working with global and local cross-industry, multi-stakeholder organizations and proactively advocating for our work at global, regional and local levels. In higher-risk situations, multi-stakeholder working groups develop and monitor an exit plan to manage the risks identified. We worked with Datamaran, an organization that identifies and monitors ESG risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis by scanning regulatory, media and corporate disclosure environments. Looking Ahead With a focus and emphasis on Life Safety programs and management systems, NIKE will establish cross-functional and global processes to elevate our standards and playbooks associated with emergency action, fire safety, medical response and first aid and occupational health management. Those statements, estimates and projections are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Risk Management NIKE Global Risk Management (GRM) is an independent and objective audit and risk organization that is guided by a philosophy of enhancing and protecting NIKE, Inc.s value and brand through world-class risk management capabilities. Our approach is industry-leading because we: Connect executive compensation to progress against our 2025 targets Leverage annual milestones to improve performance management Extend accountability of targets deeper into our value chain, specifically in the areas of waste, labor and supplier diversity Align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other global external frameworks We know that progress will not be linear, but accountability in this space means sharing our successes and learning from our setbacks. We know that many, if not all, of these issues are interconnected, with management of our top issues being dependent on how we manage other issues identified on the matrix. As a result, we saw a downward shift in our ratings from 94% compliance to 85%, which was anticipated as part of the scope expansion. 100% Play Active Kids Metric FY20 FY21FY21 Change vs. These Q4 adjustments generally reflect an FY20 Q3 trailing 12-month view of performance and provided a more conservative view of where we landed on FY20 targets than would be rendered using actual performance figures during the global shutdown. One of the main challenges we faced was the cancellation of a second year of work in India due to the COVID-19 pandemic and reprioritization of funds, requiring us to instead look for alternative options for project opportunities."

For the 9 Planet targets and the 3 Supply Chain targets, the target year (in which the target value is expected to be achieved) is considered the full FY25. To date, 100% of suppliers have shared their data with NIKE, which has enabled us to analyze it in depth to understand key areas of strength and opportunity across our supply chain and identify areas where further support is needed. Not only will we look to build the right tools and processes to support an inclusive culture and engagement in our supply chain, but we will continue to tap into survey insights to help prioritize and develop a more data-driven approach. Supplier Lifecycle We then integrate compliance with our Code and CLS throughout the supplier lifecycle and supplier management led by our sourcing teams. We use this survey to hold our business teams accountable in strengthening and improving responsible business practices in our supply chain. The Nike Grind program was named as a top three finalist out of 86 applicants for Gartners 2021 Power of the Professions Award for Social Impact in recognition of our cutting-edge circular supply chain. Second, the SBTs scope reaches deeper into our supply chain than ever before and extends further than our direct influence. All strategic suppliers completed the assessment, resulting in an average score of 56%, with each strategic supplier acting to improve their policies and practices. We call this chemical visibility, and we are scaling industry tools to capture supplier inventory conformance to the ZDHC MRSL. We plan to scale this program to all the supplier groups in the Supplier Sustainability Council (SSC) in FY23 and to the remaining in-scope supplier groups by 2025. The EWB Survey was conducted in 71 strategic supplier locations in FY21, exceeding our annual goal of 59 suppliers. Activated the BD&I Portal by SupplierGATEWAY , a diverse supplier registration portal, in FY21 to establish a direct connection between suppliers and buyers (8.5% of total suppliers are currently diverse) and identified four areas with the most diverse supplier growth potential (Real Estate, Technology, Brand Marketing, Professional Services). Activity data used to calculate Scope 3 inbound and outbound emissions are sourced from third-party invoices (e.g., supplier expenditure including weight, transportation type, distance, and weight/ volume) and is collected across the business via a variety of internal processes and systems. Divest: If the relationship with an existing supplier is terminated, resulting from poor performance against our foundational expectations or other reasons, our responsible exit process is triggered. Based on the new data, we have a target to remove zinc pyrthione from our supply chain by 2025. Our strategy to expand and grow the diverse supplier base resulted in a movement of $197 million of NIKEs supplier spend in FY21 to diverse suppliers. This research helps inform our understanding of wage competitiveness in our supply chain, in general, and how and where to focus our support for suppliers in developing their compensation systems. Weve seen interest across the industry as seven other retail brands have piloted the SDT in their supply chains. This program was piloted with 10 suppliers in FY21 and will scale to in-scope Tier 2 suppliers in FY22. The two phases of our target include measuring engagement, and then building the systems and capabilities to improve engagement.% suppliers measuring and improving engagement33 LISTEN TO THE WORKER through annual deployment of the EWB Survey at a factory levelBUILD SUPPLIER CAPABILITIES by holding factory management accountable in sharing survey results and developing an action planIMPROVE EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE by implementing an action plan and building strength of overall human resource management (HRM) systems Measure ImproveTarget 100% FY210% FY20 33 Criteria for measuring and improving engagement must be met for the factory to count toward the target KPI of measuring and improving. As our global business evolves, NIKEs goal is hygienic and healthy workplaces across our supply chain, which includes those operated by suppliers. While COVID-19-related supplier shutdowns slowed the initial expansion of this initiative, production has ramped up and closed-loop EVA recycling is growing. While none of the strategic suppliers reached a mature level of gender equity in FY21, the first year of our five-year target, more than 95% of suppliers met our FY21 milestone to deploy and validate this assessment, develop an action plan and implement actions. At its heart, this program is supporting the deepest parts of our supply chain to take climate action and create ripple effects within the industry and beyond. This program brings organizational capabilities, data analytics and energy management activities to suppliers. To better support suppliers in their efforts to improve working conditions, we work with third-party service providers to design programs that provide the tools needed to enable suppliers to meet and importantly, to sustain, compliance with our foundational expectations. Meaningful climate action requires long-term commitments and engagement with all parts of our supply chain. While wrapping up the aforementioned projects, NIKE also laid the groundwork for future projects to begin in FY22 that will bolster existing efforts in Australia and expand our project portfolio to additional priority communities in our extended cotton supply chain. SCAP not only provides technical assistance to suppliers to help set more ambitious climate goals but also turns the process of achieving our supply chain emission reductions into an aligned strategic effort. In doing so, we help suppliers assess the different capabilities needed to enable mature compensation approaches as part of their overall strategic HRM systems. This requires an integrated, holistic approach where internal teams and external suppliers work together to continuously optimize the whole system. NIKE enables a standardized approach through our guidelines on best practices in implementing worker voice tools, a process weve developed for survey vendors, and an action planning guide, driving supplier ownership and accountability. NIKE is exploring different ways to support PPAs across our major markets and encouraging suppliers to take advantage of those opportunities where they exist. We will begin reporting on progress next year as suppliers begin to enter this next phase. $ spent on diverse suppliers Target $1B FY21$197M FY20 54 FY21 NIKE, Inc.

Labor Practice Indicators,"NIKE has increased expectations on identifying and addressing forced labor, child labor and freedom of association. We have found these suppliers have an average gross pay of 1 .9 times the minimum wage (excluding overtime) across 13 countries. We believe the adoption of the Employer Pays Principle is critical in helping eliminate forced labor risks in our supply chain, the industry and beyond.By the end of FY20, 13 of suppliers facilities in six different countries (China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Honduras and El Salvador) had completed the FLAs wage data collection tool. Hiring and employing foreign migrant workers carries heightened risks of forced labor.","Strengthened expectations on identifying and addressing forced labor, child labor and freedom of association. Labor rights in the supply chain Protection and monitoring of the labor rights of workers throughout all of NIKEs supply chain (operations and manufacturing), including the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, child labor and other labor rights. We have found these suppliers have an average gross pay of 1.9 times the minimum wage (excluding overtime) across 13 countries. We believe the adoption of the Employer Pays Principle, which prohibits workers from paying fees for their employment, is critical in helping eliminate forced labor risks in our supply chain, the industry and beyond. Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Pay & BenefitsWe define pay equity as equal compensation for employees who undertake the same work at the same career level, location, experience and performance. Strategic and fair compensation is a key priority that we will continue to articulate to suppliers as part of our broader work on HRM, and in doing so, we emphasize two important elements supporting workers livelihoods and remaining competitive employers of choice in local labor markets. We will also continue to strengthen our relationships with civil society organizations in key regions, and particularly as it relates to the important connection between freedom of association and wages. Forced labor Operations and suppliers identified as having significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labor. On average, these suppliers pay 1.7 times the applicable national poverty line (where available).34 In addition we found that 53% pay above applicable living wage benchmark(s) where available.35 To supplement the current benchmarks, we also work with external organizations to secure data on local manufacturing wages in the apparel and footwear industry, along with other industries in key countries. 75 The industry average comes from the United States Department of Labor; Bureau of Labor Statistics. Pay is average net pay, excluding overtime. Visibility Is Key Enhancing our visibility into worker take-home pay and supplier compensation structures through our relationship with the FLA has strengthened this work even further. In FY19, NIKE launched Verites CUMULUS Forced Labor Screen in Malaysia, a due diligence tool to help identify risks related to the recruitment of foreign migrant workers by suppliers. At the beginning of 2019, a number of employees elected to work overtime in order to meet production demands. This process helps us identify risks and opportunities to further support suppliers and their recruiting agents in implementing best practices and serves as an ongoing tool to monitor the effectiveness of programs in addressing and minimizing risks related to forced labor. By the end of FY20, 13 of suppliers facilities in six different countries (China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Honduras and El Salvador) had completed the FLAs wage data collection tool, which allows suppliers to evaluate their wage data relative to external local living wage benchmarks where available, such as legal minimum wage, national poverty lines and estimates of living wages. Hiring and employing foreign migrant workers carries heightened risks of forced labor due to the complex network of actors throughout the recruitment and employment process. During FY21, we hosted a series of compensation sessions with internal groups, including WON, to provide greater awareness of our pay philosophy and to educate employees on how pay is evaluated during key moments throughout their careers.

Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Inclusive Culture & EngagementWe have now scaled our wage data collection to 103 strategic suppliers that manufacture 80% of NIKEs product by volume and employ over 700,000 workers. NIKE believes addressing critical human rights risks, such as forced labor, often requires collective action. For each of these suppliers, we have compared their wage data to external benchmarks in order to assess progress toward fair wage as defined in our CLS. Our FY21 pay equity data shows that for every $1 earned by men, women globally earned $1, and for every $1 earned by white employees in the U. 35 Represents 51 out of 97 suppliers where living wage benchmarks are available. NIKE is working with suppliers around the world as they seek to develop strategic compensation capabilities (such as competitive wage and benefits systems that progressively meet their employees basic needs, including some discretionary income), because every employee has the right to a standard of living that adequately supports them and their families. Best practices include having integrated IT systems, benchmarking with the local labor market, aligning incentives and incorporating worker voice. Since May 2017, the EWB Survey has been deployed at 85 unique factories, representing more than 490,000 workers. We then added over 500 temporary workers to staff the production demands, many of whom had never worked in a manufacturing environment before. It focused on helping suppliers assess the effective implementation of policies by engaging deeply with workers and getting a sense of how well workers Phil Knight displays his apparel-making skills in this set of photographs taken in December 1982. In 2016, we signed the White House Equal Pay Pledge and have developed an ongoing discipline of reviewing our pay practices annually to achieve and maintain pay equity for our approximately 75,000 teammates across all geographies, functions and business units. Spotlight Employment of Foreign Migrant Workers At NIKE, we have a responsibility to conduct our business ethically. This research helps inform our understanding of wages in our supply chain, in general, and how and where to focus our support for suppliers in developing their compensation systems. More than 1,600 employees from six countries participated in the compensation sessions, and 95% said they would recommend the session to others. We used the following benchmarks where available, and a composite where multiple benchmarks are available: Global Living Wage Coalition, Asia Floor Wage; Wage Indicator Foundation, Cost of Living Estimate (Turkey), Living Wage Estimate EIL-SV (El Salvador). During FY21, we raised our minimum hourly rate to $15 for retail store teammates in North America and increased our hourly rates for store employees across EMEA.29PAY & BENEFITSFocus Area 1:1 men/women 1:1 white/U. Building on the regional trainings offered to suppliers since FY19, in FY21, NIKE worked with the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI) to deliver the Responsible Recruitment Due Diligence Toolkit training to all strategic materials suppliers in Taiwan. Through our engagement with these and other organizations, we work to address a wide range of human rights risks, including those related to forced labor. In partnership with NIKEs Responsible Sourcing and Manufacturing teams, we also piloted the industry-leading Social Labor Convergence Programs (SLCP) EHS self-assessment module and verification at select global logistics operations. All NIKE Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers operating in Thailand that employ foreign migrant workers will have access to the program enabling onsite support, expert consultation and ongoing engagement with workers and supplier management."
