The evolution and execution of our global supply chain strategy is overseen by the Supply Chain Council (SCC)","Throughout 2021, we performed robust supply chain risk management processes for our BinaxNOW tests. We maintain a robust, multi-layered governance structure that provides oversight of all supply chain-related activities, helping minimize risks and maximize opportunities to address shared impacts. Abbott utilizes a third-party risk monitoring tool to perform real-time analysis of critical supplier sourcing locations, tracking potential geopolitical, security, sustainability, environmental and infrastructure risks. The survey helps us understand supplier sustainability maturity and opportunities to improve supply chain sustainability and resilience, covering: Management systems Compliance and reporting Ethics Human rights and labor practices Health and safety Environmental performance Supply chain management Suppliers are determined to be high sustainability risk when responses are not aligned with the expectations outlined in our Supplier Guidelines. As such, a cross- functional team including corporate and divisional EHS, Procurement and Supply Chain functions has partnered to identify our most carbon-intensive suppliers and sourcing categories with the greatest opportunities for emission reductions. In addition to survey respondents, 51 high sustainability risk suppliers were audited with overall findings indicating Abbott is limited to minimal sustainability risk based on the suppliers assessed.22 Safeguarding Business Continuity and Supply Chain Risk Mitigation Risk profiling, global event monitoring and an alert system support identification of potential supply disruptions and inform proactive responses. It centers around five objectives: Ensure our supply network aligns with, protects and elevates our brand Create relationships that deliver shared value by conducting business with transparency and trust Enhance margins and elevate financial performance by optimizing total cost, balancing risk with return and certainty Expedite growth and drive innovation through proprietary and exclusive opportunities Design a flexible, dynamic supply network, driving service with value and quality while mitigating supply riskSupply Chain Governance We are constantly evolving how we manage supplier relationships to minimize our shared sustainability impacts. While limited physical risks exist at site and regional operation levels and throughout our supply chain, our diverse geographical distribution significantly mitigates the potential for substantive business impact. In 2021, our risk profiling exercise more than doubled the number of supply chain areas monitored. Our Approach to Supply Chain Management A Approximately 76,000 suppliersAcross 154 countries In 2021, we spent approximately $20.3billion with these suppliersOur Supply Chain Is Multi-Faceted More information on how we are working with suppliers to improve our environmental impacts can be found from page 40 . Organizations we partner with include: Strategic Supply Chain Initiatives Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI): promotes collaboration to improve sustainability programming and provide suppliers with capability training through online and in-person learning opportunities National Association for EHS&S Management (NAEM): encourages advanced environmental stewardship, safe and healthy workplaces, and global sustainability We also engage suppliers on sustainability risks and opportunities affiliated with products and services they supply to Abbott. The Guidelines align with the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management. We also use the tool to monitor supply chain disruptions and to identify suppliers and locations that pose potential business continuity risk. To further safeguard our business and supply chain against unforeseen events, we created a Supply Chain Resilience program to develop people, processes and tools to evaluate and engage with suppliers on identified topics. They consider supplier size, maturity, industry, sourcing regions, ESG performance and Abbott spend. The evolution and execution of our global supply chain strategy is overseen by the Supply Chain Council (SCC), which meets quarterly and reports regularly to the GOC.

Today, over 130 OH professionals support employee health and well-being, treat illnesses and injuries, and maintain employee medical records. We maintain global policies and standards for managing employee health and safety. Fostering a Health and Safety Culture To build a robust health and safety culture, we must engage everyone at Abbott something we achieve and maintain through our EHS policy and several technical and management standards, including: Risk Assessment and Self-Assessment Management Standard: requirements for assessing and mitigating health and safety risks Training and Awareness Management Standard: requirements for employees to be aware of health and safety risks and have knowledge of job-specific hazards Area-specific technical standards: e.g., Fleet Safety, Control of Hazardous Energy, Confined Spaces, Ergonomics, Electrical Safety, Biological Safety and Working at Heights Emergency Preparedness Standard: requirements for emergency preparedness planning and minimum requirements to ensure health and safety on-site and in surrounding communities. Occupational Health Services Our global Occupational Health Services (OHS) team part of the EHS organization develops and maintains occupational health (OH) policies, procedures and guidelines, trains relevant employees and consults on regulatory compliance. We refreshed our internal ergonomic technical standard to more thoroughly address the leading causes of illness and injuries. They conduct regular screenings and health education programs to identify and minimize occupational risks.

At the end of 2021, 22 Abbott sites were certified to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 45001.The health and safety of our employees and contract workers is paramount for Abbott. Further information on how we ensure the health and safety of our employees and contract workers is on page 38 . Through an integrated Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) management system and a dedicated EHS Leadership Council, we are embedding a culture of safety across every area of our business. Created the first rapid handheld traumatic brain injury blood test, which can reduce the need for expensive CT scans. In India, our commercial EHS team is developing a vehicle safety initiative focused on two-wheelers to reduce crash-related injuries. Regional security experts and our Travel Safety program protect employees traveling for work. Each site must comply with robust contractor EHS management programs, including: Training for Abbott employees responsible for contractor activities An EHS approval process for contractorcompanies Orientations for contractor employees EHS plans for projects over $2 million A full-time safety representative on large construction projects Inspections of contractor activity Contractor completion of Job Hazard Analyses or Risk Assessment and MethodStatements Evaluation of contractor companys EHSperformance We regularly evaluate commercial operations, manufacturing and research and development (R&D) sites through internal compliance assurance audits that cover: Health and safety Strategic planning and prioritization Risk assessment/self-assessment Business integration Training and awareness Communication and information Performance measures Senior leadership uses EHS scorecards to monitor performance. While social distancing, wearing a mask, frequent hand washing, and asking that employees stay home (with pay) if they feel ill or show symptoms are all critical steps to maintaining a healthy work environment, our program of regular testing gave our employees additional peace of mind as they returned to the office. At each Abbott site, designated safety representatives and safety teams help ensure the successful implementation of our internal programs. Continuing to Keep People Healthy During COVID-19 Throughout 2021, we have maintained robust on-site cleaning procedures and continued to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to those who require it. And we will similarly invest in upgrading our safety and quality processes and equipment. To retain them, we must show we care by nurturing career development and safeguarding their health, safety and well-being. This team is also responsible for implementing our global employee health and productivity strategy, tracking progress against key performance indicators (KPIs) and identifying improvement opportunities. Additionally, increased focus was placed on creating a global task force on lockout/tagout control of hazardous energy, a step that will help ensure enhanced safety procedures are followed when servicing machinery. These include ongoing driver safety initiatives and multiple ergonomic projects. We offer programs that support worklife harmony and promote good health, with many available to employees families as well. These facilities provide safe, clean and confidential spaces to discuss a variety of gender-specific health concerns including family planning. To support this, we have developed our Occupational Health Services Standard, requiring facilities to provide adequate resources and designated healthcare professionals with site-specific knowledge. Health and well-being are at the center of everything we do each day to tackle the worlds most pressing health problems. In 2021, we expanded our EAP to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, South Africa and Vietnam, reaching more employees with mental health support. Thats why Abbott is an active participant in global dialogs on the role of business in ensuring better health. Thousands of employees participated in wellness sessions, including a webinar on reducing stress, overcoming burnout, enhancing relationships and creating work life balance, and a live meditation session. In addition to distributing personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintaining rigorous cleaning processes, we established programs that help keep everyone healthy."

Several sites use energy data and innovative methods to identify and quantify energy inefficiencies in manufacturing processes, often employing external experts. Processed Foods Standard Energy Management FB-PF-130a.1: (1) Total energy consumed, (2)percentage grid electricity and (3)percentagerenewableThe total energy consumption (Scope 1 and 2) in 2021 was 14,126,000 gigajoules. Increasingly Green Transport We have established a range of initiatives to manage fuel consumption in our commercial fleet as well as the fuel consumption during employee commuting. These include establishing increasingly robust requirements for vehicle fuel efficiency, providing on-site electric vehicle charging stations, promoting car-sharing and, where possible, public transportation use. Renewable Energy We are committed to purchasing a greater proportion of electricity from renewable sources and are developing a Renewable Energy Procurement initiative to drive continuous improvement in this area. Renewable Energy Procurement We are always on the lookout for renewable energy sourcing options, increasingly purchasing electricity from utility providers that include above average renewable generation in their energy mix. In 2021, we purchased 190 million kWh of low-carbon and renewable energy, resulting in savings of 80,000 metric tons of CO 2e. In 2021, we purchased 190 million kWh of low-carbon and renewable energy, resulting in savings of 80,000 metric tons of CO2e. This increased boiler efficiency by 3%, by controlling excess oxygen and fuel ratio to increase percentage of complete combustion. For example, in Indonesia, many of our motors have been upgraded with variable speed drives, reducing energy requirements while retaining performance.

The environmental metrics we track and report against are available from page 93.Powering Our Facilities Renewably We are committed to purchasing a greater proportion of electricity from renewable sources and are developing a Renewable Energy Procurement initiative to drive continuous improvement in this area. They will include all GHG emissions covered by the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) methodology for GHG reporting. This switch also resulted in a financial saving, plus an environmental benefit of an annual GHG emission reduction of about 20metric tons. (m) Per the GHGP, Scope 1 Refrigerant CO 2e emissions include only those covered in the Kyoto Protocol. b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the related risks. We refer to external standards, such as the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). The total electricity purchased was 4,538,000 gigajoules. (k) Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the GHGP market-based methodology. Taken together, this switch will result in annual financial savings of over $16,500 and energy savings of over 187 ,100kWh. We calculate them annually using the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, referring to the 10 Scope 3 categories* that apply to Abbott (see Our Carbon Footprint infographic). (j) Progress toward 2030 carbon goal is reported using the GHGP Scope 2 market-based methodology. Were working to reduce the negative impacts of our emissions by investing in renewable energy, reducing fleet fuel consumption, increasing manufacturing efficiency and partnering with suppliers. Unless specified otherwise, emissions are calculated according to the GHGP Scope 2 location-based method. (n) Reported Scope 2 sources consist of energy directly purchased by Abbott, such as electricity, steam, and hot and chilled water, as well as emissions from leased locations. Our most significant climate-related risks are transition risks that relate to emerging expectations and regulations around GHG emission management. Along with these documents, our Global EHS Governance team provides guidance on: Energy efficiency in manufacturing operations Low-carbon energy investments Transportation fleet efficiency Supply chain carbon footprint Public reporting of our performance We align with international frameworks including CDP and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol to measure, track, reduce and report emissions. In addition, we also generated 1.8 million kWh from solar installations at eight of our sites. (l) Reported Purchased Fuels Scope 1 sources consist of fuel consumed by manufacturing, R&D and warehouse facilities under Abbotts control; sales fleet; and Abbott-owned aviation. Per the GHGP, where market-based information is not available, location-based results have been used as proxy."
