Over the last decade, Omar and his team examined where they could leverage opportunities to make the facility more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. Energize is a unique, sector-wide initiative aiming to increase access to renewable energy within the pharmaceutical supply chain. If successful, CAR T could become more cost-efficient and widely used. We completed energy assessments at our largest manufacturing facilities that represent 40% of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 footprint.

Increased procurement of renewable electricity was the primary driver of these reductions. Figures presented in upstream transportation and distribution represent both upstream and downstream emissions. We established a near-term reduction target for our indirect Scope 3 emissions. In 2021, we achieved a 12% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions compared to our 2018 baseline and a 1% reduction compared to the prior year. In 2021, we took on a robust body of work to calculate the baseline for our Scope 3 emissions. Our approach is centered around the concept of additionalityor directly supporting the development of new renewable generation sources. Renewable electricity procurement is critical to our near-term strategy. For Thermo Fisher, this achievement demonstrates that operating without fossil fuels is possible in a manufacturing setting. Best explained by site leader Omar Castillo, [Operating without fossil fuels] is a result of many steps we took over a period of several years. Environment 42 25 We continue to participate in the US EPA Energy Star program and use the ENERGY STAR symbol to make it easy for our customers to identify and purchase energy-efficient products that help them save on energy costs and reduce emissions caused by inefficient energy use.
