Fuel Consumption Linde s total non -renewable fuel consumption in 2021 was 75.6 million GJ, or 21 million MWh. Even though it is light and small, hydrogen is a powerful energy carrier and can, for example, be used to store excess renewable energy. In periods of peak energy demand, Linde can interrupt its grid power use and effectively reduce grid electric load (by the equivalent of 40,000 homes from a single location). Our business and production processes are therefore energy-intensive, making the cost and availability of energy important for Linde. Key projects include advanced thermal barrier coatings and advanced sealing technologies; improving global plant efficiency, energy optimization, logistics and operations optimization; and flexible operations to support demand- side management and allow for higher utilization of renewably produced electrical power. 2 Row e includes only active renewable energy consumed.

Targets to improve energy efficiency in ASUs and to increase low-carbon power sourcing address this issue. Achieve 7 percent improvement in ASU energy intensity The scope is Linde ASU facilities worldwide where Linde pays for the power and has operational control, including 50 percent majority-held joint ventures. In 2021, the company sourced 17 million MWh low-carbon energy, or 40 percent of all its purchased electricity. In addition, Linde actively contributes to grid decarbonization in multiple ways: Lindes business proposition is that it is more reliable and more energy efficient for our customers to outsource the production of industrial gases than to insource. Linde will actively contribute to this target by doubling the purchase of low-carbon energy by 2028. Electricity Consumed Total non -renewable electricity consumed in 2021 was approximately 40 million MWh, or 144 million GJ. Lindes Government Relations department participates in discussions with international, national and sub-national governmental bodies regarding legislation that impacts our business, drives energy efficiency, delivers positive outcomes in electricity regulation and supports our unique technologies to produce clean energy. Non -renewable electricity consumed1 39,042,000 39,448,000 39,129,000 39,999,000 c. Lindes design investment can provide ancillary service for grid operators to maintain reliable electric power service as wind and solar energy become a greater part of our resource mix. The largest electricity user is ASUs, which account for approximately 90 percent of all electricity used. We can envision a future where hydrogen fuel cells will be widely adopted; green electricity will be available commercially; and energy and fuel markets will be linked. It is a versatile, clean and safe energy carrier that can be used as fuel for power or in the industry as feedstock. By 2035, we expect that hydrogen derivatives will become the new energy vector and an essential means to transport low-cost renewable power around the world. Passively procured electricity from the grid was calculated using the latest location -based renewable energy grid factors from the IEA and, where available, plant -specific RE factors according to the supplier contract/utility bill."

Lindes LWCR is defined as the number of Recordable Injury Cases (RICs) plus the number of Recordable Sickness Cases (RSCs) that result in one or more day(s) away from work as a result of a work-related incident or exposure per 200,000 hours worked (for employees and contractors). For example, Linde values the safety of its employees and contractors and invested approximately 5 million hours of safety training in 2021. A recordable case is defined as any recordable injury or sickness of an employee, temporary worker or contractor that results from a work- related incident or exposure per 200,000 hours worked. 403-9 Work-related Injuries Note: This section also responds to 403-6. The benefit of these continuous efforts is that Linde's employee and contractor safety performance continues to be better than general industry benchmarks and among the best within the industrial gases and chemical industry. Safety Training Worldwide contractor safety training: One hundred percent of contract drivers, and most contract construction workers, are hired from local firms. As an example, the learning and conclusions identified from the 2020 analysis resulted in additional 2021 safety initiatives in the areas of addressing driver fatigue and driver distraction in addition to a continued focus in transport contractor management and driver development programs. SHEQ also leads consultations and communications with employees on health and safety program s and initiatives. In 2021 , Linde invested approximately 5 million hours in safety training for its employees and contractors. Training Environmental and safety training is conducted for all employees and all contractors, as defined in the SHEQ Management System and Standard Operating Procedures (see 404 -1). Safety Training 403-5 Linde is committed to providing its employees with a safe operating environment by investing in state- of-the-art technology and driving a culture in which safety is the top priority. Annually achieve operational safety better than industry levels for Lost Workday Case Rate (LWCR) and Total Recordable Case Rate (TRCR). One outcome of this effort is that Lindes safety record is several times better than industry benchmarks, which gives us confidence that our employees and contractors return home safely at the end of their day. Safety training is conducted for all employees and all contractors, as defined in the SHEQ Management System and Standard Operating Procedures . In addition, the company's pipeline business has frequent events to educate the community about the busi ness and the importance of safety. In addition to the jobs provided to locally based construction workers and drivers, in 2021, Linde invested more than 2 million hours in safety training to contractors in several categories . 403-6 Promotion of worker health See Sustainable Development Report, pages 76 , 77, 79 and 80. On average Linde employees at facilities and offices received approximately 48 hours of formal safety training in 2021 . (See 20 4-1 for information on safety training for contractors. ) On a regular basis, Linde works with its carriers on safety training, initiatives and sharing best practices to continuously improve upon operational efficienc y, reduce environmental hazards and promote security and human rights. Safety t raining is conducted for all employees, in all functions. Linde 's program on Safety Leadership: Training, Resources, and Personal Commitment provides additional details. Contractors working at Linde plants are required to receive safety induction training. Training in H uman Rights Relevant to Linde s Value Chain One hundred percent of construction contractors and 100 percent of contract truck drivers are trained in Linde s operational safety requirements."
