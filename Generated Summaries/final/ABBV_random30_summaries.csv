We pursue the highest standardsoften exceeding legal and regulatory requirementsin quality, safety, compliance and performance. Our pride in product quality and commitment to patient safety are a powerful combination that motivates employees to stay vigilant, speak up and be part of the solution. S.

AbbVie has been an active participant with the TBDA, providing crucial compounds from our library, expertise in medicinal and computational chemistry, pharmacokinetics, assay development and screening, drug safety and toxicology studies to the challenges of anti-TB drug discovery and development. Should our suppliers need support to achieve compliance or have an interest in establishing higher standards, our Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) team offers pro bono services, including EHS audits and sustainability training."
Operational Eco-Efficiency,"In 2021, AbbVie surpassed its 2025 emissions reduction target of 25%, four years ahead of schedule. The company saved almost 15,000 kilowatt hours of energy globally in 2021.

Furthermore, AbbVie has implemented energy efficiency measures, which decreased both our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We increased the amount of renewable electricity that we purchase to over 30% globally in 2021 and are on track to meet our 2025 target of increasing renewable energy sourcing to 50%. The new boilers have increased efficiency to over 90% and are significantly more efficient than the previous units, which were at least 30 years old. Our determined efforts to reduce carbon emissions are being achieved largely through investment in technology, infrastructure and processes that increase energy efficiency and use cleaner energy sources. One example comes from a packaging format change for MAVYRET (for 84 count monthly tablet packs), where weve seen a greenhouse gas equivalent reduction of 98% and a recycling potential increase of 64% compared to the previously used packaging. These goals are quantitative (e.g., reducing carbon emissions using a specific target) and qualitative (e.g., maintaining status as a top employer) in nature. In 2021, we replaced all steam boilers at our manufacturing site in Campo Verde, Italy. The SPARK Innovation Accelerator is an incubator for employee-driven ideas that accelerate our efforts to reduce energy consumption, water use and waste. We accomplished this by increasing our investment in renewable sources, decreasing our Scope 2 emissions. We committed to join the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and are working on setting ambitious science-based emissions reduction targets.

For example, of the new vehicles that were introduced in our UK fleet, 95% were electric or hybrid, and over 30% of all the new vehicles introduced in our Western Europe fleet were electric or hybrid. We continue to expand the use of electric and hybrid vehicles in our fleets, as well as explore other opportunities to reduce emissions. In 2021, AbbVie surpassed its 2025 emissions reduction target of 25%, four years ahead of schedule."
