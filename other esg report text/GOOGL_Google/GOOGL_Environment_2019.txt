Google Environmental Report 2019Environmental sustainability  
at Google
At Google, we believe that technology can be used to help address the 
biggest issues facing humanity. Climate change is a pressing global issue 
that poses an imminent threat to our planet. In 2018 alone, we experienced 
unprecedented heat waves, wildfires, and flooding in California, along 
with many other extreme weather events around the world. It’s clear that 
immediate action must be taken on a global scale if the impacts of climate 
change are to be mitigated and, ideally, reversed.
Google has a longstanding commitment to climate action and 
environmental stewardship. Sustainability has been a core value since 
Google’s founding, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. 
In 2018, we achieved twelve consecutive years of carbon neutrality and, for 
the second year in a row, matched 100% of the electricity consumption of 
our global operations with renewable energy. We also announced our long-
term goal to power our operations with carbon-free energy, 24x7, 365 days  
a year.
We’re exploring the role of artificial intelligence in helping us achieve even 
greater energy efficiency gains in our data centers, and we’re prioritizing the 
use of healthy materials with safe chemistry across Google’s built spaces. 
Beyond Google’s operations, we’re expanding access to the benefits of 
technology through energy-saving initiatives like the Nest Power Project. 
We’re also working closely with partners to develop tools for policymakers, 
planners, and researchers that will enable better-informed decisions and 
actions, like the Environmental Insights Explorer, which provides city-level 
carbon emissions data.
In the years to come, we’ll focus on how Google can accelerate the 
transition toward carbon-free energy and a circular economy, empower 
everyone with technology that enables sustainable action, and benefit the 
communities where we operate. 
Google remains steadfast in its commitment to sustainability, and we will 
continue to look for collaborative partnerships and innovative opportunities 
to help create a clean and healthy planet for everyone.

Our approach
5 Google Environmental Report 20196
Google Environmental Report 2019 Our approachMission and values
Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally 
accessible and useful. Fulfilling this mission, and bringing the benefits of 
information not just to the more than 3 billion people who are already online 
but to the next 4 billion, requires us to use resources ever more efficiently.3 
The path to a cleaner, healthier future begins with the small decisions we 
make each day. That’s why we strive to build sustainability into everything we 
do. We’re raising the bar in making smart use of Earth’s resources, expecting 
the highest ethical standards throughout our supply chain, and creating 
products with people and the planet in mind. We’re also constantly looking for 
ways to have a positive environmental impact and be even more responsible 
in our use of energy, water, and other natural resources—and we want to help 
others to do the same. 
This ambition is reflected across our value chain. Our data centers lead the 
industry in energy efficiency—they’re twice as efficient as the industry average 
for enterprise data centers. We’ve been carbon neutral since 2007, and now for 
the second year in a row, we’ve matched 100% of the electricity our operations 
use with renewables. This same ethos carries over to our workplaces, with over 
1.2 million square meters (13 million square feet) of Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) certified offices, and to our products. Whether 
The Googleplex in Mountain View, California7
Google Environmental Report 2019 Our approachsomeone is using Google at home or as part of an organization running Google 
Cloud  or G Suite , all of the products in our Cloud are carbon neutral. As we 
continue to grow, we’re on a journey to make our Made by Google consumer 
electronics products work for people and the planet. 
Our tools are built to help everyone reduce their environmental impact, 
understand the planet, and take sustainable action. By mapping the world’s 
forests and fisheries, our technology is making it easier for policymakers, 
researchers, and nonprofits to monitor the pulse of the planet. We’re also 
making it easier for everyone to take sustainable action by providing more 
than 1 billion kilometers (km) (621 million miles) of alternative transit options 
through Google Maps  every day and by helping people reduce their home 
energy consumption with Nest thermostats, which have helped customers 
cumulatively save more than 29 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy.
Addressing a global challenge
Humanity is consuming natural resources at an astonishing rate. During 
the 20th century, global raw material use rose at about twice the rate of 
population growth.4 Every year humanity consumes far more than what  
the planet can naturally replenish. In 2018, global demand for resources  
was 1.7 times what the Earth's ecosystems can regenerate in a year.5
These statistics highlight the need to rethink the “take-make-waste” 
economic model that human societies have followed since the Industrial 
Revolution, in which we take a natural resource, make a product from it or 
burn it for fuel, and eventually send what remains to the landfill as waste. 
The consequences of this model have created some of the most significant 
challenges of our time, including climate change, extreme weather events, 
and plastic pollution, among others. 
Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our 
time, and continued greenhouse gas emissions pose an existential threat to 
humanity. The science behind this is clear, and recent reports have stressed 
the urgency of the issue. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change released a special report  addressing the need for rapid transition and 
widespread action in the next 12 years if we are to limit global warming to the 
1.5 degree Celsius warming scenario.6 Given this pressing time horizon, it’s 
now more important than ever for governments, businesses, and individuals 
around the world to take immediate and ambitious action on climate at a 
global scale. We believe that Google’s scale, resources, and technological 
expertise can help the world meet its energy and resource needs in a 
responsible way that drives innovation and growth. By the end of 2018,  
Nest thermostats had  
helped customers 
cumulatively save  
more than  
29  billion  
kWh of energy.Google’s data center in

Google Environmental Report 2019 Our approachTaking action
With millions more people coming online every month, the demand for 
computing power continues to skyrocket and data center capacity continues 
to expand to meet this need. But despite this growth, the total amount 
of electricity used by U.S. data centers has remained constant. Annual 
consumption increased by 90% from 2000 to 2005, but only by 4% from 
2010 to 2014, largely due to data centers’ ability to improve their efficiency 
as they scale.7 As the use of mobile devices increases and more IT users 
transition to public clouds, we believe our industry can and must do better 
than just holding the line on energy use. We can actually lower it, serving 
more users while using fewer resources.
Google’s energy consumption drives our biggest impact on the 
environment. Internally, we’re focused on tackling it through a threefold 
strategy for carbon neutrality. Beyond Google, we’ve long been a vocal 
advocate for greening electrical grids worldwide. We support strong clean-
energy and climate-change policies committed to adding clean power to 
the grid, and we’re partnering with governments and nongovernmental 
organizations to use Google technology to model the effects of climate 
change on both a global and a local level.9
Google Environmental Report 2019 Our approachOur sustainability goals, like committing to match the electricity use  
for our operations with 100% renewable energy, not only are good for  
the environment but also make good business sense. By purchasing 
electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar, we can set a long-term 
fixed price for power. This allows us to gain access to an increasingly cost-
competitive source of electricity, and it helps us save money in the long run. 
By the end of 2018, we had contracts to purchase more than 3.75 gigawatts 
(GW) of output from renewable energy projects. These contracts have led to 
nearly $5 billion in new capital investment in projects around the world.8 
We’re also working to incorporate a climate-resilience strategy into our 
operations that will enable our business and the communities we’re part of to 
thrive despite the effects of climate change. The key principles that serve as 
the foundation for our strategy are focused on a people-centric framework 
that’s robust, integrated, diverse, and designed with unique locations, 
scalability, and longevity in mind.9 This framework was used to conduct a 
climate exposure and vulnerability analysis that enabled us to assess the 
future resilience of our current locations and evaluate the climate resilience 
of new developments. Beyond our operations, Google’s AI for Social Good  
program  and Crisis Response  platforms are using our technology to enhance 
flood forecasting models that provide predictions to inform individuals in 
affected areas so that they can better prepare and stay safe.
Charleston Retention Basin on

in Mountain View, California10
Google Environmental Report 2019 Our approachWater is another top priority. The United Nations predicts that by 2025, 
two-thirds of the world’s population could live in water-stressed conditions, 
and with the existing climate change scenario, almost half the world’s 
population will be living in areas of high water stress by 2030.10 As a global 
company headquartered in drought-prone California, we’ve established a set 
of water principles to guide our approach to water use and ensure business 
continuity, especially in the places where we have the greatest potential risk. 
Under these principles, we’re working to utilize water efficiently, exploring 
ways to incorporate circularity, and engaging in partnerships that use Google 
technology to raise awareness of water-related risks and opportunities and 
to create platforms that help everyone study and understand global water 
challenges. Examples of sustainable water management practices can be 
seen in our data centers, where we keep working to find innovative  
cooling options where possible, like the use of seawater in Finland,  
industrial canal water in Belgium, and air cooling in Ireland. Through  
Google.org, we’ve awarded millions of dollars in grants to promising  
water-conservation solutions.11 
We see the circular economy as a complex yet inspiring information 
challenge that, once unlocked, will lead to a world of abundance where 
human, environmental, and economic systems can thrive. That’s why 
we’re leveraging our scale, resources, technological expertise, and close 
partnerships with organizations like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, as well 
as with other leading companies, to accelerate the transition to a circular 
economy and help the world meet its resource needs.
Ultimately, our goal is to maximize the reuse of finite resources across 
our operations, products, and supply chains and enable others to do the 
same. We’re applying our circular economy principles  to design out waste, 
keep products and materials in use, and promote healthy materials and safe 
chemistry. We strive to embed these principles across our infrastructure, 
operations, and products, from how we manage servers in our data centers 
to how we design our consumer electronics to the materials we select to 
build and furnish our offices. As we work toward this goal, we’ll continue 
exploring the role of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in accelerating 
our transition to becoming a circular Google that contributes to a  
sustainable world.Our goal is to maximize  
the reuse of finite 
resources across our 
operations, products,  
and supply chains and 
enable others to do  
the same. Figure 1 
GOOGLE VALUE CHAIN
11
Google Environmental Report 2019 Our approachSetting our priorities
Google uses energy, natural resources, and products and services from our 
suppliers to build our workplaces, data centers, networking infrastructure, 
and consumer electronics. The software products and services that our 
customers and users rely on are powered by our data centers and networking 
infrastructure (see Figure 1). We’re driving positive environmental impact 
throughout our value chain in five key ways: by designing efficient data 
centers, advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, 
building better devices and services, and empowering users with technology.
In 2018, we undertook an assessment to identify and prioritize content for 
our environmental report that considered Google’s impact on sustainability, 
the importance of environmental sustainability issues to our business 
strategy, and the perspectives of a diverse range of stakeholders outside of 
Google. The issue areas that were found to be of greatest relevance include 
our data centers, workplaces, users, water stewardship, circular economy 
strategy, and supply chain. Cutting across these priorities is the importance 
of engaging in public policy—at local, state, federal, and international levels—
to support the success of sustainable business models. 
As per recommendations from the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we have reported our exposure 
to climate-related risks over multiple time horizons in Alphabet’s 2019 CDP 
Climate Change Report .

Google Environmental Report 2019 Our approachLooking toward future opportunities 
We believe global businesses like Google should lead the way in improving 
people’s lives, while reducing or even eliminating our dependence on raw 
materials and fossil fuels. And we believe this can be done in a way that makes 
business sense, providing economic returns alongside societal benefits and 
positive environmental impacts.
Planning for the future, we’ve established a five-year strategy that will 
enable us to continue building sustainability into everything we do  
(see Figure 2). Our strategy focuses on three key pillars: to accelerate the 
transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, to empower users 
with technology, and to benefit the people and places where we operate. 
We’re continuing to work to decouple our business growth from the growth 
of material use and carbon intensity. This includes enhancing our net positive 
impact through initiatives that help our users reduce carbon emissions, save 
energy, and use resources more sustainably. We also want to ensure that 
Google products, tools, and platforms inform or enable sustainability, and that 
we’re implementing practices to add value to our communities within and 
outside of Google.
Creating Google tools that help people measure the planet’s health and 
take action is a key part of our long-term strategy. Applications of machine 
learning (ML) and AI are increasingly enabling not only Google but also 
scientists and practitioners to create sustainable solutions and to turn data 
into insights and knowledge needed to guide better decision-making. We’re 
excited to continue exploring how these technologies and applications can be 
used to create a more sustainable future for generations to come—and we’re 
committed to using these technologies in a responsible way.12

Google Environmental Report 2019 Designing efficient data centersOverview
Google’s data centers are the heart of our company, powering products like 
Search , Gmail , and YouTube  for billions of people around the world, 24x7. We 
own and operate 15 data centers13 on four continents and continue to add 
new sites to better serve our customers. Each data center is a large campus 
where the vast majority of our facilities, servers, networking equipment, and 
cooling systems are designed from the ground up for maximum efficiency 
and minimal environmental impact.
For more than a decade, we’ve worked to make Google data centers some 
of the most efficient in the world, improving their environmental performance 
even as demand for our products has dramatically risen. We’ve done this 
by designing, building, and operating each one to maximize efficient use of 
energy, water, and materials. 
To reduce energy use, we strive to build the world’s most energy-efficient 
computing network by squeezing more out of every watt of power we 
consume. First, we outfit each data center with high-performance servers 
that we’ve custom designed to use as little energy as possible. We improve 
facility energy use by installing smart temperature and lighting controls and 
redesigning how power is distributed to reduce energy loss. We employ 
advanced cooling techniques, relying primarily on energy-efficient evaporative 
cooling, and use nonpotable water at some sites. Finally, we’re applying 
machine learning to drive energy efficiency even further.
Our efforts have paid off: On average, a Google data center is twice as 
energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center.15 Compared with five years 
ago, we now deliver around seven times as much computing power with 
the same amount of electrical power. Much of this improvement has come 
from new innovations with accelerators, such as our Tensor Processing Units 
(TPUs)—highly efficient computer chips we designed specifically for machine 
learning applications. PERCENT— 15

Google Environmental Report 2019 Designing efficient data centersIn 2018, the average annual power usage effectiveness (PUE)16 for our global 
fleet of data centers was 1.11, compared with the industry average of 1.6717—
meaning that Google data centers use about six times less overhead energy 
(11%) for every unit of IT equipment energy (see Figure 3). We aim to maintain 
or improve our quarterly PUE at each Google data center, year over year. Our 
fleet-wide PUE has stayed at or below 1.12 since 2013 (see Figure 4). 
Generating electricity requires water, so the less energy we use to power 
our data centers, the less water we use as well. The source of energy matters 
too: Wind and solar energy require considerably less water to produce than 
do coal and nuclear energy. In 2018, matching our data center electricity 
consumption with renewable energy reduced embedded water use by  
88% on average compared with buying grid power.21
Google Environmental Report 2019 Designing efficient data centersIn 2013, we became the first company in North America—and the only 
major internet company—to achieve a multi-site energy management system 
certification to ISO 50001, a voluntary third-party standard. Our energy 
management system intends to cover all of our owned data centers globally 
once they meet certain operational milestones. In 2018, we maintained 
ISO 50001 certification for 12 of our 15 Google-owned and -operated data 
centers, which together represented 91% of our IT energy use.18
We’re also working to design out waste, embedding circular economy 
principles into our server management by reusing materials multiple times.  
In 2018, 19% of components used for machine upgrades were refurbished 
inventory. When we can’t find a new use for our equipment, we completely 
erase any components that stored data and then resell them. In 2018, we 
resold nearly 3.5 million units into the secondary market for reuse by  
other organizations.
We’re committed to achieving Zero Waste to Landfill19 for our global data 
center operations by reducing the amount of waste we generate and finding 
better disposal options. In 2018, we diverted 87% of waste from our global 
data center operations away from landfills.
In addition to driving efficiency in our data center operations, we also 
consider supply chain impacts. Through the efforts of our Responsible Supply 
Chain program, we collaborate with stakeholders across our supply chain 
to uphold our high standards for protecting workers and the environment. 
Google’s data center in Saint-Ghislain, Belgium22
Google Environmental Report 2019 Designing efficient data centersOur Supplier Code  of Conduct  builds upon Google’s core values and beliefs and 
incorporates key elements from the Google Code of Conduct  and international 
human rights, safety, and environmental standards.
Google has saved more than $1 billion through our energy-efficiency initiatives 
and hundreds of millions more through resource efficiency. By sharing our best 
practices and supporting research and collaboration, we hope to help other 
companies realize their own savings and promote ever-greater data center 
sustainability worldwide.
Google’s investment in digital infrastructure, such as data centers, also supports 
sustainable growth and creates economic opportunity. In 2016, Google’s U.S. data 
centers generated $1.3 billion in economic activity, $750 million in labor income, 
and 11,000 jobs.20 From 2007 to 2017, Google’s data center investments in Europe 
supported economic activity with €490 million per year in gross domestic product 
(GDP) and 6,600 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs per year, on average.21
Carbon-neutral cloud services 
Google Cloud Platform  and G Suite  products like Gmail , Docs , and Drive  are 
enabling millions of businesses to shift computing needs from self-managed 
data centers or colocation facilities to Google Cloud’s highly efficient, renewable 
energy–based computing infrastructure. Businesses that switch to cloud-based 
products like G Suite have reported reductions in IT energy use and carbon 
emissions up to 87%,22 and a business using Gmail can reduce the GHG emissions 
impact of its email service by up to 98%, compared with running email via on-
premises servers.23 Individual users also benefit, since providing an active user one 
month of Google services creates fewer GHG emissions than driving a car one 
mile.24  Whether someone is using Google at home or as part of an organization 
running Google Cloud or G Suite, all of the products in our Cloud are  
carbon neutral.

Automated AI takes Google 
data center efficiency to  
next level
In 2016, we jointly developed an AI-powered recommendation system to 
improve the energy efficiency of Google’s already highly-optimized data 
centers. Now we’re taking this system to the next level: instead of human-
implemented recommendations, our AI system is directly controlling data 
center cooling, while remaining under the expert supervision of our  
data center operators. This first-of-its-kind cloud-based control system  
is now safely delivering energy savings in multiple Google data centers.
Whereas our original recommendation system had operators vetting 
and implementing actions, our new AI control system directly implements 
the actions. We’ve purposefully constrained the system’s optimization 
boundaries to a narrower operating regime to prioritize safety and 
reliability, meaning there is a risk/reward trade off in terms of  
energy reductions.
Despite being in place for only a matter of months, the system is already 
delivering consistent energy savings of around 30 percent on average, 
with further expected improvements. That’s because these systems get 
better over time with more data. Our direct AI control system is finding 
yet more novel ways to manage cooling that have surprised even the data 
center operators. Dan Fuenffinger, one of Google’s data center operators 
who has worked extensively alongside the system, remarked: “It was 
amazing to see the AI learn to take advantage of winter conditions and 
produce colder than normal water, which reduces the energy required for 
cooling within the data center. Rules don’t get better over time,  
but AI does.”
We’re excited that our direct AI control system is operating safely and 
dependably, while consistently delivering energy savings. However, data 
centers are just the beginning. In the long term, we think there's potential 
to apply this technology in other industrial settings, and help tackle 
climate change on an even grander scale.

Google Environmental Report 2019Advancing 
carbon-free 
energyOverview
Running our business requires us to use a lot of electricity to power our data 
centers, offices, and other infrastructure. And combating climate change 
requires the world to transition to a clean energy economy. So we’ve made 
it a top priority to become more energy efficient and to match every unit 
of energy we consume at our facilities around the world with an equivalent 
unit of energy from renewable sources, such as wind and solar. Our support 
for clean energy goes hand in hand with reducing our carbon footprint. By 
improving the efficiency of our operations and buying both renewable power 
and high-quality carbon offsets, we’ve been carbon neutral since 2007.
Google is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy.25 
Since 2010, we’ve signed 34 agreements to purchase a total of more than 
3.75 GW of renewable energy that is new to the grid (see Figure 5).26 On July 
27, 2015, as part of the American Business Act on Climate Pledge , Google 
committed to tripling our purchases of renewable energy from 1.1 GW to  
3.4 GW by 2025. We surpassed this in 2018, exceeding our target seven  
years early.
In 2012, we set a long-term goal to purchase enough renewable energy to 
match all the electricity we consume globally on an annual basis. In 2017, we 
achieved it for the first time: Google’s total purchase of energy from sources 
like wind and solar matched the amount of electricity used by our operations 
around the world, including our offices and data centers. And in 2018, we 
again matched 100% of our annual electricity consumption with purchases 
of renewable energy (see Figure 6). This amounted to more than 10 million 
megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy—more electricity than is used annually 
by the state of Hawaii.27 To date, we’ve purchased a total of nearly 26 million 
MWh of renewable energy.
We’re the first company of our size to achieve 100% renewable energy  
two years running.28 While we’re still drawing power from the grid, some 
of which is from fossil fuel resources, we’re purchasing enough renewable 
energy to match every MWh of electricity our data center and office 
operations consume.
Our long-term goal is to source carbon-free energy to match our 
electricity consumption in all places, at all times . This means realizing a future 
where each Google facility is always matched—around the clock—with local 
carbon-free power. Our ultimate vision is to create a world where everyone 
has access to clean energy; this includes not only Google, but our suppliers 
and their communities. CARBON-FREE ENERGY:

Google Environmental Report 2019 Advancing carbon-free energyReaching 100%  
renewable energy
We achieved our 100% renewable energy target much faster and at much 
greater scale than we thought possible when we set this goal seven years 
ago. We met it primarily by buying renewable electricity directly from new 
wind and solar farms via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) 
on the grids where we have operations, as well as by buying renewable 
power through utilities via renewable energy purchasing models that we 
helped create. In addition, a portion of our utility energy purchases include 
renewable sources as part of the utility’s grid mix.29 With our PPAs, we’re 
purchasing physical renewable energy, which includes the electrons bundled 
with renewable energy certificates (RECs).
By pioneering new energy purchasing models that others can follow, we’ve 
helped drive wide-scale adoption of clean energy. For example, we joined 
forces with Walmart, Target, and Johnson & Johnson  in Georgia to help build 
a state-approved program that allows companies to buy renewable energy 
directly through the state’s largest utility. The program is the first of its kind in 
Georgia and has paved the way for construction of two solar energy projects 
with a total capacity of 177 megawatts (MW).

Google Environmental Report 2019 Advancing carbon-free energyAlso in the Southeast region of the United States, we worked with the 
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)  to sign a utility-based agreement where 
Google will purchase the output of several new solar farms, totaling 413 MW 
of power from 1.6 million solar panels— equivalent to the combined size of 
65,000 home rooftop solar systems. Thanks to the abundant solar power 
generated by these new farms, electricity consumed by our new data centers 
under construction in Tennessee and Alabama will be matched with 100% 
renewable energy from day one.
Our efforts to expand carbon-free energy in 2018 also took us to Europe, 
where we announced agreements in Finland  to purchase additional 
renewable electricity from three new wind farms totaling 190 MW—our first 
such deals in the country.
Our renewable energy initiatives earned Google two 2018 Green Power 
Leadership Awards: one in International Market Development from the Center 
for Resource Solutions and one in Excellence in Green Power Use from the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
DeepMind and Google recently started using machine learning (ML) to 
make wind power more predictable  and valuable. We used ML to optimize 
700 MW of wind power capacity in the Central United States that is part of 
our global fleet of renewable energy projects. By predicting wind power 
output 36 hours ahead of actual generation, our model recommends how

valuable to the grid. To date, ML has boosted the value of our wind energy 
by roughly 20%, compared to the baseline scenario of no time-based 
commitments to the grid.
We’re also helping to green the power grid through our advocacy of 
clean energy policies and our support for renewable energy procurement 
programs. For example, we worked with business and government 
stakeholders in Taiwan to share our experience with the benefits of corporate 
renewable energy purchasing and to support the creation of new purchasing 
channels for companies. We were pleased to see that Taiwan passed a law 
in January 2017 to allow end-users to directly purchase renewable energy 
for their operations. In 2018, we signed our inaugural renewable energy deal 
in Asia , the first such corporate power purchase agreement in Taiwan. We 
will purchase the output of a 10 MW solar array (which is part of a larger 
solar farm) in Tainan City, Taiwan. It will deploy 40,000 solar panels across 
commercial fishing ponds, maximizing land-use efficiency and benefiting 
local aquaculture workers. This will boost the carbon-free profile of our local 
data center.

Google Environmental Report 2019 Advancing carbon-free energy
Minco II wind farm in Oklahoma 
(101 MW for Google)Along with being the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable 
energy, Google is also one of the world’s largest corporate investors in 
renewable energy. Since 2010, we’ve committed to invest nearly $2.5 billion 
in large-scale renewable energy projects and residential solar rooftop funds 
with a total combined capacity of 3.7 GW.30 These targeted investments 
go beyond our own operational footprint, enabling renewable energy 
deployment at a larger scale while generating attractive risk-adjusted returns.
The cost of renewable power has dropped precipitously, while its scale 
has grown dramatically. Since 2009, levelized costs for utility-scale wind 
and solar energy have decreased by 69% and 88%, respectively.31 In 2015, 
wind and solar energy became the world’s largest source of newly installed 
power capacity,32 and in 2018, 65% of net new power capacity globally came 
from renewable energy.33 Renewables have become a mainstream source of 
affordable electricity for millions of people.
Increasing the share of renewables on the grid will produce many positive 
impacts. For example, doubling renewables by 2030 is expected to increase 
global GDP by as much as 1.1%, improve global welfare by 3.7%, and employ 
more than 24 million people in the renewable energy sector.34 To date, 
Google’s renewable energy purchasing contracts have led to nearly $5 billion 
in new capital investment in renewable energy projects around the world.35 
At Google, we’ll continue doing our best to help accelerate the transition to 
clean energy and a more prosperous future.

Google Environmental Report 2019 Advancing carbon-free energyOur carbon footprint
We began calculating our annual carbon footprint in 2006. Every year since 
2009, we’ve publicly reported the results to CDP, a global organization that 
asks companies to disclose information on their GHG emissions performance 
and management. Our report received an A score from CDP for the past five 
years, and for the past four years, we earned a spot on CDP’s Climate A List, 
which recognizes top reporting companies.
In 2018, our gross Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions were 4.4 million metric 
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), but because of our renewable 
energy purchases, our net GHG emissions were reduced by 3.7 million tons to 
750 thousand tCO2e (see Figures 7 and 8). Due to growth in our business, our 
operational emissions increased 30% over the past year.36 After accounting 
for our carbon offset purchases, our net operational carbon emissions  
were zero.
Since 2011, our renewable energy purchasing has resulted in emissions 
savings of nearly 11 million tCO2e—a cumulative 52% reduction in our Scope 
1 and 2 emissions over this period (see Figure 9). This is equivalent to taking 
nearly 2.3 million cars off the road for a year, or the carbon sequestered by 
more than 12.5 million acres of U.S. forests in a year.37 In 2018, our operational 
GHG emissions were 83% lower due to our renewable energy procurement  
(see Figure 9).

Google Environmental Report 2019 Advancing carbon-free energyTo align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, in 2018, we 
extended our boundaries to include manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 
1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, 
end-of-life treatment of sold products, and emissions associated with food 
from our corporate offices. We continue to improve the level of certainty we 
have in calculating our Scope 3 emissions and to work to reduce them. For 
example, our vision is for all our suppliers’ sites to source 100% renewable 
energy in every region where our products are made.
Because of our emissions-reduction efforts, our carbon intensity has 
steadily decreased even as our company has grown and our energy use 
has correspondingly increased. Since 2011, our carbon intensity39 per unit 
of revenue decreased by 86% (see Figure 10), our carbon intensity per 
FTE employee decreased by 84% (see Figure 11), and our carbon intensity 
for electricity used at our data centers dropped by 91%. This means we’re 
delivering our products and services with reduced carbon impacts, even 
before using carbon offsets to reach neutrality.

Delfzijl wind farm in the 
Netherlands (63 MW for Google)Twelve years of carbon neutrality
In 2007, Google committed to being carbon neutral, and we’ve met this goal 
every year since then. We reach carbon neutrality via three steps. First, we 
work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energy-
efficiency initiatives. Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption 
of our operations with purchases of renewable energy. Third, we buy carbon 
offsets for any remaining emissions we haven’t yet eliminated.40
When we committed to carbon neutrality, we saw carbon offsets as an 
interim solution. As we work to reduce our emissions, our need for carbon 
offsets will continue to decrease. We reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
improving energy efficiency and procuring renewable energy. We reduce our 
operational Scope 3 emissions by minimizing the need for business travel 
through encouraging use of video conferencing tools like Google Hangouts  
for meetings, and facilitating employees to use sustainable commuting 
options for employees, such as public transit, shuttles, carpooling, or  
electric vehicles.
When we do purchase carbon offsets, we follow stringent principles. 
We invest in high-quality, third-party-verified offsets, including landfill 
gas projects and animal waste management systems. All our offsets are 
additional, meaning that the projects reduce GHG emissions that wouldn’t

invest in are permanent sources of carbon reduction or sequestration, rather 
than temporary solutions. Finally, whenever possible, we invest for the long 
term, which offers owners and developers the financial stability they need to 
continue operating.
Google has been carbon neutral for twelve years, and in that time, we’ve 
partnered with more than 40 carbon offset projects to offset more than 19 
million tCO2e.41 One of Google’s long-standing project partners is Oneida-
Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, a landfill gas project in upstate 
New York, United States. By enabling us to reduce our carbon footprint while 
reducing local air pollution, improving waste management, and increasing 
local revenue streams, each of these collaborations is a win for both Google 
and our communities. 
Our commitment to reduce GHG emissions goes beyond our operational 
boundaries; some of our products enable users to reduce their own GHG 
emissions. For example, Google Maps and Waze Carpoo l help commuters 
reduce emissions by making transit and carpooling information more 
accessible. Nest thermostats help people reduce home energy consumption 
by controlling heating and cooling. And Project Sunroof  helps users estimate 
potential solar energy production if they were to install rooftop solar. We 
will continue to work toward net zero carbon in the decade to come and to 
increase the net positive impact of our products.

The Internet is 24x7—carbon-
free energy should be too
Electricity is the fuel that allows our data centers to deliver billions  
of Google searches, YouTube views, and much more—every single day, 
around the clock. For the past two years, we matched 100% of our electricity 
consumption with purchases of renewable energy.
As exciting as this milestone was, it was only the first step toward a much 
more ambitious, long-term challenge: to source carbon-free energy to match 
our electricity consumption in all places, at all times . This means realizing a 
future where each Google facility is always matched—around the clock—  
with local carbon-free power.
In October 2018, we published an inside look at the sources of Google's 
electricity around the globe, to gauge how we're tracking toward our long-
term aspiration of sourcing 24x7 carbon-free energy. We shared location-
specific “Carbon Heat Maps” to visualize how well a data center is matched 
with carbon-free energy on an hour-by-hour basis. 
Some of our data centers—like the one in Hamina, Finland—are already 
performing remarkably well: 97% of the facility’s electricity use last year  
was matched with carbon-free sources. Others still have room to improve.
Creating a carbon-free future will not be easy. It will require innovations 
across policy, technology, and business models. But the urgency of climate 
change demands bold solutions. “We’re keeping our eyes on the prize,”  
says Michael Terrell, director of operations at Google. “And that’s making  
carbon-free power the status quo.”

Google Environmental Report 2019Creating 
sustainable 
workplacesOverview
Americans spend roughly 90% of their time indoors, and much of that time 
is spent at work.42 At Google, just as we focus on people when it comes to 
designing our products, we also focus on people when creating healthy and 
sustainable workplaces—from our Bay Area headquarters to our offices in 
more than 150 cities spanning over 50 countries around the world. To do 
so, we look for innovative ideas that deliver measurable results and can be 
implemented at scale. 
We start by applying industry-leading green building standards wherever 
possible. Our ongoing goal is to pursue third-party green or healthy-building 
certifications for our office projects, such as LEED, WELL Building Standard, 
and Living Building Challenge. By the end of 2018, over 1.2 million square 
meters (13 million square feet) of Google office facilities had achieved LEED 
certification, with 28% of our LEED-certified square footage achieving a 
Platinum rating and 57% a Gold rating (see Figure 12).
As part of our carbon neutral strategy, we continually pursue energy 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our energy consumption. In 2011, our Google 
office in New York City committed to the NYC Carbon Challenge—a voluntary, 
public-private partnership with the mayor’s office in which organizations 
strive for a 30% reduction in GHG emissions per FTE by 2030. After meeting 
the 30% reduction goal early, we committed to a 50% reduction goal by 
2025.43 By the end of 2018, we had already met our target seven years ahead 
of schedule—reducing GHG emissions by 54% per FTE at our New York City 
office—primarily due to various energy efficiency and emissions  
reductions projects.
We also have a strong focus on the impacts associated with material 
selection, production, transportation, use, serviceability, and recycling of the 
products used for our spaces. We work to ensure that these products are 
safe for humans and the environment throughout their life cycles. We believe 
an industry-wide transition to safe chemistry and healthy materials is on the 
horizon. But making safe chemistry and healthy materials the new norm will 
require collective action across sectors, increased access to high-quality data 
that assesses chemical hazards, demand signals (from buyers like Google) 
to material and product manufacturers, and advancements in recycling 
technology and infrastructure.SUSTAINABLE WORKPLACES:

Google Environmental Report 2019 Creating sustainable workplacesConsidering local environments
We take a science- and community-driven approach to managing our 
campuses, with the aim of having a positive impact in the places where we 
operate and of designing and building our offices with local environments, 
ecology, and animal habitats in mind. One example is the thriving egret 
rookery in the middle of our Mountain View, California, campus. Since 2013, 
the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society (SCVAS) and Google have worked 
together to provide conservation guidance and educational programming for 
the nesting area. Conservation efforts include limiting vehicular traffic during 
the breeding season, establishing a protocol for collecting and caring for 
injured and orphaned egrets, and installing signage. Additionally, the SCVAS 
organizes “Egret Office Hours,” attracting hundreds of Googlers, community 
members, North Bayshore company employees, nature enthusiasts, school 
groups, and others to learn about the rookery.
Another example is our science-based Design Guidelines for Bay Area 
landscaping projects. By the end of 2018, we had implemented our Habitat 
Design Guidelines on over 100 acres across our Bay Area headquarters. Areas 
once defined by lawn and hedges now host vibrant colonies of California 
wildflowers teeming with native bees and butterflies. These areas are studied 
and monitored to help inform future design decisions.

Google Environmental Report 2019 Creating sustainable workplacesSustainability in our offices
We reduce our water footprint by installing water-saving technologies and 
using reclaimed water wherever possible. In 2018, we set a target to reduce 
potable water intensity at our Bay Area headquarters by 5% by 2019. We’re 
on track to meet this target: By the end of 2018, we achieved a 3% reduction 
in potable water intensity—equivalent to avoiding the use of over 42 million 
liters (11 million gallons) of potable water. Our current approach to global goal 
setting focuses on the highest-impact opportunities. We’re now targeting our 
work at Google offices in highly water-stressed locations and in offices that 
are supported by recycling and composting infrastructure.
We implement strategies to minimize contamination in our office waste 
streams and identify diversion pathways that keep the waste we do generate 
out of landfills. In 2018, we reached 76% landfill diversion for our offices 
globally, and we surpassed our target to reduce landfill waste per Googler by 
10% at our Bay Area headquarters—achieving a 15% reduction in landfill waste 
per Googler by the end of 2018. We also tracked waste generation for global 
offices that represent 53% of Google’s total headcount. 
Our cafés and Food Spots offer nutritious, responsibly sourced meals, 
snacks, and beverages.44  We make thoughtful choices in the products we 
buy and the suppliers we buy them from. Our sustainability priorities include 
food waste prevention, sustainable hydration initiatives that encourage the 
use of reusable vessels for drinking water, and the promotion of balanced,

and support human health and well-being. We constantly come up with 
inventive solutions to repurpose food and look to compost and donate 
leftovers wherever we’re legally able to do so, but we’ve learned that the best 
way to reduce food waste is to prevent it in the first place by tracking data 
and making adjustments. In 2018, this sort of data-driven optimization helped 
Google prevent more than 1 million kilograms (2.25 million pounds) of  
pre-consumer food waste in our cafés around the world, totaling over 3 
million kilograms (6.6 million pounds) of food waste prevented since 2014. 
Also, by the end of 2018, 12 of our top 25 office sites were on track to  
reduce single-use beverages per seated headcount by 20% relative  
to a 2017 baseline. 
Our Transportation team plans, implements, and operates mobility 
solutions to support Google’s global growth. We set ambitious goals for 
helping Googlers transition to shuttles, carpooling, public transit, biking, 
and walking. There are also a growing number of electric vehicles in our 
Google-owned and -operated commuter program fleet, with the majority 
of the nonelectric vehicles using renewable diesel. In 2018, our Bay Area 
headquarters remained on track to meet our long-term goal of reducing 
single-occupancy vehicle commuting to 45%. We also have a target to 
provide electric vehicle charging stations for 10% of total parking spaces at 
our Bay Area headquarters. To date, we’re on track to incorporate this design 
standard for new construction and tenant improvement projects and we’ve 
installed more than 2,700 electric vehicle charging ports at our offices in the 
United States. In 2018, our Google shuttle buses in the Bay Area produced

more than 165 million vehicle kilometers (102 million vehicle miles) per year or 
taking 8,760 cars off the road every work day.
Because sustainability is part of our culture, we give our employees 
opportunities to engage on environmental issues and put their passions into 
practice at work. Our Bay Area headquarters and many of our global offices 
host annual events to celebrate Earth Day and World Environment Day, where 
we share how Googlers can be sustainable on campus, at home, and in their 
communities. We also host an annual employee recognition program to 
recognize Googlers around the world who are driving sustainability across 
the company. The award winners are selected by members of our executive 
leadership team and are invited to attend an internal awards ceremony. 
Throughout the year we also invite thought leaders and experts to speak  
on the latest trends, achievements, and challenges related to sustainability, 
some of which are posted on the Talks at Google YouTube channel.
Our employees constantly reinvigorate our determination to build a better 
future. As we continue to explore sustainability strategies, we’re committed 
to sharing what we learn with other companies to help foster the growth of 
more productive, environmentally friendly businesses.

The journey toward  
healthier materials
If you want to construct a building that’s healthier for people and the planet, 
the solution seems simple: Choose healthy materials made from safe 
chemistry. But, if you don’t have information to understand what’s healthier, 
where do you start?
That’s the challenge we took on several years ago with the launch of our 
Healthy Materials Program. A natural extension of Google’s belief in using 
data to shed light and inform decision-making, the program is intended  
to fill the information gap between common building materials and the  
safety of the chemicals used to make them. 
More broadly, we hope to lead the market toward safer chemistry and 
healthier materials. We’ll do this through increased transparency and by 
continuing to use our purchasing power to underscore that material health  
is as important as budget and availability in the decision-making process. 
We’re currently focusing our approach to build on our successes and the 
lessons we’ve learned. Our next step is to empower everyone to join the 
healthy materials movement by sharing what we know.
“For healthy materials to be on every shelf in every hardware store in every 
corner of the world, we need thousands of companies doing this with us,” 
says Robin Bass, who leads the Sustainability Programs Team for Google’s 
Real Estate and Workplace Services. “The more people that demand healthier 
materials, the more we move the needle.”

Google Environmental Report 2019 Building better devices and servicesOverview 
At Google, we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. And, now 
that our business includes building consumer hardware, our commitment 
remains the same. Our ambition is that every product we build will leave 
people, the planet, and our communities better than we found them. We’re at 
the start of a journey of reimagining how even better devices and consumer 
hardware experiences are created. 
Although we’ve been making some consumer devices for a while, Google’s 
consumer hardware product area was formed just over three years ago. 
We’re working to integrate sustainability into our products, operations, 
and communities—making it not just an aspect of how we do business but 
the centerpiece of it. This is an ongoing endeavor that involves designing 
in sustainability from the start and embedding it into the entire product 
development process and across our operations, all while creating the 
products our customers want.
To help us get a step closer to reaching our goals, in 2019 we shared a set of 
sustainability commitments for hardware devices and services. By 2020, 100% 
of all shipments going to or from customers will be carbon neutral. By 2022, 
100% of Made by Google products will include recycled materials, with a drive 
to maximize recycled content whenever possible. And we’re committed to 
making technology that puts people first and expands access to the benefits 
of technology.
Looking ahead, we know there’s more work to be done. We’ll continue 
working to design energy-efficient products. We’ll continue working to extend 
the useful life of our products by making them more serviceable. And we’ll 
continue ensuring that our products are accessible for as many people as 
possible. We’re excited about the direction we’re headed.DEVICES AND SERVICES:

Google Environmental Report 2019 Building better devices and servicesConsumer devices
Over the past few years, we’ve been steadily growing our family of great 
consumer hardware products . We see tremendous potential for devices to 
be helpful, make your life easier, and get better over time by combining the 
best of Google’s AI, software, and hardware. This is reflected in our latest 
generation of hardware products like Pixel 3  phones and the Google Nest Hub 
smart display. Creating beautiful products that people rely on every day is a 
journey that we’re investing in for the long run, and one we want to do in a 
sustainable way.
In 2018, we launched a suite of new products, including the Pixel 3 and 
Pixel 3 XL phones , Google  Pixel Slate , Google Nest Hub , Google Clips , Google  
Nest Hello Doorbell , Google  Nest Temperature Sensor , Nest x Yale Lock , Titan 
Security Key , and Chromecast . Other products we offer include Google  
Home , Google Home Max , Google Home Mini , and Google Pixelbook . We 
hold ourselves to the highest environmental standards and strive to ensure 
that Google products are designed, manufactured, and disposed of in a 
sustainable way. This applies to how we think about materials, manufacturing 
processes, energy efficiency, and packaging.
We’re laying the foundation for what we believe will be a way of doing 
business that commits to building better products and services. Google has 
a company-level goal to increase the sustainability and circularity of our 
consumer electronic products, operations, and communities. We’ve made 
good progress so far, and we have great momentum.

Google Environmental Report 2019 Building better devices and servicesFor most devices, in 2018 we began publishing product environmental  
reports , which help people understand the sustainability attributes of our 
products. Each product environmental report provides an overview of that 
device’s environmental impact in areas such as material composition, life 
cycle GHG emissions, and energy efficiency. Starting in 2020, we’ll publish 
product environmental reports for all of the flagship products we launch.
We consider sustainability throughout the entire life cycle of a device, 
including its production, transportation, use, and end of life. Our product life 
cycle assessments give us insight into our largest opportunities for reducing 
the environmental impact of a given product. For example, GHG emissions 
from shipping are an important contributor to the environmental impact of 
our products. From 2017 to 2018, we reduced carbon emissions for product 
shipments by 40% per unit, on average, by shifting many devices from air to 
ocean shipping.
We want to ensure that the materials and substances used for our products 
are safe for people and the environment, can be reused to create future 
products, and retain economic value. One of the keys to unlocking the 
circular economy is safer chemistry from the start, so in 2017, we published 
our Restricted Substances Specification  to ensure the use of safer materials 
across our products.
We support greener electronics standards and certifications, including  
UL 110, IEEE 1680.1, and the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool 
(EPEAT).45 We strive for the highest rating available for applicable products 
within available product categories. We’ve achieved EPEAT Gold registration 
for all current models of the Pixel 3 phone.46
We also strive to make our products as energy-efficient as possible. For 
example, the 2018 Google Pixelbook  incorporates power-management 
software to reduce energy consumption during use. This allowed it to attain 
ENERGY STAR ® certification, which means it has energy performance 
among the top 25% of similar products of its type. And in 2018 alone, Nest 
thermostats helped customers save nearly 12 billion kWh of energy—more 
energy than Google used in 2018.
To accelerate the transition to a circular economy, it’s critical to create 
demand for recycled materials. To date, we’ve shipped millions of devices 
made with post-consumer recycled plastic. Products like the Nest  
Thermostat E , Google Home , and Chromecast  all contain parts with 20%–
75% post-consumer recycled plastic content.The Nest Learning Thermostat in a home
47
Google Environmental Report 2019 Building better devices and servicesNew plastic made from fossil fuels is the industry standard for consumer 
electronics, and incorporating recycled plastic involves surmounting a 
number of challenges. It requires building new processes and approaches 
while ensuring that materials meet our rigorous quality and technical 
specifications, costs are viable, and products are delivered on time. To meet 
these requirements, we spent years building partnerships with top-tier 
raw materials suppliers willing to invest in producing high-quality materials 
and innovation. Going forward, we’re committed to expanding the use of 
sustainable materials across our portfolio of products.
We’re also making it easier for people to give their old devices a second 
life. Customers can responsibly recycle devices for free—whether made by 
Google or not—via our take-back program  for all products, available in 16 
countries, and via our U.S. Pixel trade-in program , through which customers 
can earn credit toward a new Pixel purchase. 
Our commitments go beyond the consumer electronic products we 
make. We’re committed to minimizing our environmental impact as well 
as improving the lives of people who make our products. We require the 
highest ethical standards throughout our supply chain and are working to 
drive positive impacts in the communities in which we operate. Our Supplier 
Code of Conduct  articulates our expectations for suppliers and is based on 
the Google Code of Conduct and on international human rights, safety, and 
environmental standards.
Building on the progress we’ve already made, in 2019, we shared our 
inaugural public commitments for consumer hardware. First, we aim to design 
products and services for circularity and to reuse materials at their highest 48
Google Environmental Report 2019 Building better devices and servicesenvironmental and social value. Many of our Nest products already include 
significant levels of post-consumer recycled plastic. Starting in 2022, 100% of 
Made by Google products will include recycled materials, and we’ll strive to 
maximize recycled content wherever possible. By decreasing our use of new 
materials, we’ll reduce our waste per device while signaling our demand for a 
more circular economy.
Second, we aim to be the neighbor everyone wants in the communities in 
which we operate. By 2020, 100% of all shipping of device orders going to 
or from customers will be carbon neutral. To achieve carbon neutrality for 
shipping, we have a two-step approach: The first step is carbon reduction. 
Our goal is to work with shipping partners to reduce shipping emissions; 
we’ve already successfully driven a shift from air to ocean in many cases, and 
we’ll continue to look for solutions like this. For the emissions that remain, our 
second step will be to purchase high-quality carbon offsets. Shipping devices 
to consumers falls outside the scope of Google’s operations, and thus goes 
above and beyond our long-standing commitment to carbon neutrality.
Finally, we’re committed to make technology that puts people first and to 
expand access to the benefits of technology. One way we do this is through 
energy partnerships.
A family using the Google Pixel Slate49
Google Environmental Report 2019 Building better devices and servicesEnergy partnerships
Our products enable customers to be more thoughtful about their individual 
environmental impact. Connected homes can help streamline consumers’ 
daily decisions about resource consumption, making sustainable choices 
easier for busy households. For example, smart thermostats can play a critical 
role in addressing climate change by automatically saving energy and helping 
consumers be more aware of their energy usage. These savings benefit 
customers, as well as the utilities generating and delivering the energy, while 
reducing energy use and GHG emissions.
The Nest thermostat  controls residential heating and cooling systems—
which make up around half of a home’s energy consumption—and uses AI 
and ML to reduce energy consumption and achieve collective savings as 
it learns how and when to keep users comfortable while at the same time 
optimizing for energy efficiency. On average, Nest thermostats have proven 
energy savings of 10%–12% for heating and 15% for cooling,47 which means 
they pay for themselves in under two years as a result of those savings.48 In 
February 2017, the Nest Learning Thermostat became the first thermostat 
to achieve ENERGY STAR® certification by the EPA.49 And by the end of 2018, 
Nest thermostats had helped customers cumulatively save more than 29 
billion kWh of energy (see Figure 13), based on average savings studies—
enough energy to power all of San Francisco's electricity consumption for five 
years and nearly three times as much energy as Google used in 2018. That’s

We help consumers save energy and money by forming partnerships with 
a variety of energy companies and service providers across North America. 
We’ve partnered with nearly 100 companies to offer Nest thermostat and 
demand response programs .
Nest’s Rush Hour Rewards program works in partnership with utilities to 
reduce energy use during times of peak demand through harnessing the 
power of consumer engagement—acting as a leader in demand response 
programs for energy customers. For example, during the 2017 solar eclipse, 
Nest launched a special Rush Hour program with an opt-in feature that 
allowed Nest thermostats to automatically pre-cool customers’ homes, 
reducing demand on the grid at a time when solar energy production 
dropped by thousands of megawatts. More than 750,000 Nest thermostats 
worked together across the United States to reduce demand by 700 MW.51 
In 2018, Nest and partners also pioneered residential gas demand response 
programs. In a world of gas shortages and increasing weather variability, 
these programs are proving their capability to manage demand spikes and 
increase system flexibility.
We also work with energy, government, nonprofit, and manufacturer 
partners to expand access to the benefits of technology through income-
qualified programs. Today, nearly one in four U.S. families struggle with a 
high energy burden, with up to 20%–50% of income going to energy bills.52 
In 2018, we launched the Nest Power Project, which aims to install 1 million 
energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats in homes that need them 
most over the next five years. We’re proud to help our partners meet their 
efficiency and customer participation goals and are excited about our 
collective impact on consumers as well as the environment.

Nest uses energy-saving 
technology to relieve the  
low-income energy burden
In the United States, low-income households spend three times as much of 
their income on energy as higher-income households.53 What’s more, many 
of these families live in older homes with inefficient heating, ventilation, and 
air conditioning systems, often forcing families in some parts of the United 
States to devote up to 50% of their monthly income toward utilities.54
On Earth Day 2018, Nest and Google began tackling this energy gap 
with the Nest Power Project , an initiative designed to bring energy-saving 
technologies and assistance to those who need them most. To date, the 
project has donated more than $800,000 to nonprofits, such as United Way 
and Habitat for Humanity, that are helping connect low-income families with 
energy-assistance programs.
The Power Project has also teamed up with nonprofits, utility companies, 
and mortgage financiers to install the Nest Thermostat E—a smart thermostat 
with proven energy-saving features—in qualified low-income households. 
This includes every home built by Habitat for Humanity in the United States 
in 2018 and low- and moderate-income households served by organizations 
such as Southern California Gas and Fannie Mae. Together, we aim to install 
1 million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats in low-income U.S. 
homes in the next five years.
While Google and Nest ultimately envision a more energy-efficient future 
to help combat climate change, the Power Project is working to provide 
energy savings for families today. “If our thermostats and technology can 
help even one family stay warm this winter, we’ll consider it a job well done,” 
says Jeff Hamel, director of energy and enterprise partnerships at Google.

Google Environmental Report 201952Empowering 
users with 
technologyOverview
A global challenge requires a global response. We want to leverage our scale, 
resources, and technological expertise to meet the vast challenge posed by 
climate change and work to empower everyone—businesses, governments, 
nonprofit organizations, communities, and individuals—to use Google 
technology to help create a more sustainable and resource-efficient world. 
Google Earth  is used globally by millions to explore and understand 
our ever-changing planet. While Google Earth is for exploration and 
raising awareness, Google Earth Engine  is focused on planetary-scale 
geospatial analysis, giving researchers access to Google’s massive cloud 
and computational capabilities. It includes 20 petabytes of freely available 
geospatial data, which are used by tens of thousands of active users around 
the world to create new knowledge that’s fundamentally changing what we 
know about Earth’s natural resources and how to manage them.
Google Maps provides more than 1 billion kilometers’ (621 million miles’) 
worth of transit results per day, helping limit carbon emissions by giving 
people access to mass transit options, bike routes, and traffic information. 
In 2018, Google Maps added new features that enable users to search 
for information about electric vehicle charging stations around the world 
and to see nearby Lime scooters, pedal bikes, and e-bikes as alternative 
transportation options right from the app. 
Waze Carpool is also tackling the issue of too many cars on the road by 
encouraging Waze users to commute together, saving time and money, while 
reducing the strain on transportation infrastructure and the environment. 
By the end of 2018, Waze Carpool was available nationally throughout Israel, 
Brazil, and the United States.
Using technology for good
In 2018, Google AI  announced its AI for Social Good  program, which applies 
core Google research and engineering efforts to projects that help address 
social, humanitarian, and environmental challenges. Additionally, the program 
provides tools and resources through initiatives like the Google AI Impact  
Challenge , which was an open call for nonprofits, academics, and social 
enterprises from around the world to submit proposals on how they could use 
AI to help address some of the world’s greatest problems. 
In 2018, as part of Google’s AI for Social Good program and Crisis Response 
efforts, Google announced a flood-forecasting initiative pilot in Patna, 
India. To help keep people safe during floods, Google is using AI to create 
better forecasting models that predict when and where floods will occur. 
The predictions are made using a combination of ML, satellite imagery, and TECHNOLOGY:

Google Environmental Report 2019 Empowering users with technologyphysics-based simulations. The predictions are then shared with affected 
individuals via Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Public Alerts .
AI can also aid in wildlife conservation. In 2018, as part of Google’s AI for 
Social Good program, we announced the work of Google AI researchers who 
teamed up with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to 
identify if humpback whales are present in more than 170,000 hours’ worth of 
underwater audio recordings. This is part of a larger effort to help scientists 
better understand and protect whales—and hopefully in the future, other animal 
species as well.
Using TensorFlow , Google’s open source ML platform, we’re enabling 
thousands of companies, nonprofits, researchers, developers, and students to 
apply ML to better predict extreme weather events, help farmers glean insights 
into their herd’s health and efficiency improvements for their farms, and prevent 
illegal deforestation in the Amazon. 
In 2018, Google teamed up with the California Academy of Sciences to 
launch Your Plan, Your Planet , an interactive tool to help people understand 
their environmental impact as it relates to food, energy, and water, while 
demonstrating simple, science-based ways to improve it. 
Attendees explore the interactive Your Plan, Your Planet 
tool at Google’s booth at the 2018 Greentech Festival 
in Berlin, Germany.

Google Environmental Report 2019 Empowering users with technologyTools for everyone
We also put Google technology to work helping others study and respond to 
environmental challenges. Our Geo team works with numerous research and 
nonprofit organizations to map the world’s forests, fisheries, watersheds, and 
air quality—and even to create a global database of power plants. We then 
work on getting that information into the hands of decision-makers. 
In 2018, we launched the Environmental Insights Explorer  (EIE), an online 
tool created in collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate 
& Energy and in partnership with five pilot cities: Buenos Aires, Argentina; 
Melbourne, Australia; Victoria, Canada; Mountain View, California, USA; and 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. By analyzing Google’s comprehensive global 
mapping data together with standard GHG emission factors, EIE estimates 
city-scale building and transportation carbon emissions data, as well as 
renewable energy potential, leading to more globally consistent baselines 
from which cities can measure, plan, act upon, and track progress toward  
emissions reductions.
Project Sunroof is an online tool that helps users explore whether they 
should go solar by analyzing high-resolution aerial mapping and 3D modeling 
of residential roofs to sun positions, historical weather patterns, shadows 
cast by nearby objects, and typical electricity consumption. In 2018, Project 
Sunroof expanded coverage into new markets around the world, including 
Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, and 
Rooftop solar provides renewable energy to a
community in Manchester, England. Project Sunroof 
expanded coverage to the United Kingdom in 2018.
55
Google Environmental Report 2019 Empowering users with technologythe United Kingdom. Collectively, Project Sunroof has mapped more than  
107 million rooftops across 21,500 cities since 2015. Policymakers are also 
using Sunroof data to make bold renewable energy commitments. For 
example, the City of San José, California used the data for a city-wide solar 
assessment to set a 1 GW solar energy target as part of its Smart City Action 
Plan. In addition to city climate plans, Sunroof data is being used by some of 
the world’s largest utilities, such as Engie and E.ON, to provide customers 
with the option to power their homes with solar energy.
Project Air View  measures air quality data using Google Street View cars 
equipped with air quality sensors. In 2018, Project Air View increased its 
air quality mapping efforts, expanding beyond the United States to map 
air quality in Copenhagen, Denmark, and London, United Kingdom. We 
announced plans to further expand coverage to more cities around the world 
by equipping 50 Street View vehicles with Aclima’s mobile air sensors. By the 
end of 2018, Project Air View had captured more than 475 million cumulative 
air quality measurements in 62 cities worldwide.
Through Google Earth Timelapse , a global, zoomable video that lets us 
see how the world has changed over recent decades, we can watch as cities 
grow, forests disappear, glaciers recede, and lakes dry up. We can also help 
monitor and promote sustainable resource management with tools like Global 
Fishing Watch  (GFW), which monitors the planet’s fisheries by tracking the 
locations and behaviors of commercial fishing fleets, powered by Google 
Cloud Platforms’ machine learning algorithms. In 2018, GFW published 13 
papers in top-tier journals and successfully drove new commitments and 
programs with governments from Canada, Indonesia, Japan, and Peru. 
Ultimately, our vision is to continue leveraging our mapping, cloud, and ML 
technologies to create a living, breathing dashboard of our planet that can 
help inform everyday decisions for individuals, organizations, and nations.

The more you know:  
Turning environmental  
insights into action
To date, more than 10,000 cities worldwide have committed to reducing their 
carbon footprints by 80% within the next 30 years. But, unlike large cities 
like New York and Berlin, which have access to huge carbon data sets, many 
small and midsize cities lack the resources to gather comprehensive data on 
building and transportation emissions. This makes it hard to set firm carbon 
commitments of their own. 
The Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), an online tool created by Google 
in collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, is 
designed to provide carbon emissions insights to cities of all sizes—  
and ultimately accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future. 
Developed by the Google Earth Outreach team, EIE analyzes data from 
Google Maps and Google’s other climate-related projects, like Project 
Sunroof , to surface insights across four categories: building emissions, 
transportation emissions, solar energy potential, and climate projections. 
EIE pairs this information with third-party data and standard GHG emissions 
factors, deriving carbon estimates and reduction potential for cities around 
the world. 
Although EIE is starting with a handful of cities initially, Google eventually 
plans to make these insights available to thousands of towns, cities, and 
regions across the globe. “Imagine what we could accomplish if every city in 
the world were engaged in the fight against climate change,” says Rebecca 
Moore, leader of the Earth Outreach team. “What would the world look like?”

Designing efficient data centers
13. At the end of 2018, we had 15 operational campuses across 19 data center locations . Some of our locations have more than one data center campus and others were not yet operational 
during 2018.
14. According to Google’s own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages.
15. See note 14 above.
16. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of noncomputing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to power 
IT equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means nearly all the 
energy is used for computing.
17. According to the Uptime Institute's 2019 Data Center Industry Survey , the global average PUE of respondents’ largest data centers was around 1.67.
18. This slight decline from 2017 is partly due to new sites not yet included in our energy management system and partly due to a change in how we calculate this number.
19. At Google, Zero Waste to Landfill means that when waste leaves our operating data centers, none of it goes to a landfill—100% is diverted to more sustainable pathways, with no more 
than 10% going to a waste-to-energy facility, unless waste to energy can be proved more valuable than alternative diversion paths. Our approach is based on UL’s Environmental Claim

39. Carbon intensity figures are based on our combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions, with the exception of electricity consumption intensity, which is calculated using 
only market-based Scope 2 at the data centers.
40. A carbon offset is an investment in an activity that reduces carbon emissions. The reduction in carbon emissions is represented by a carbon credit. The credit, usually verified by a 
third party, signifies that GHG emissions are lower than they would have been had no one invested in the offset. One credit equals 1 metric ton (1,000 kilograms or 2,204 pounds) of 
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) prevented from being released into the atmosphere.
41. CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability of a gas to 
trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP. Carbon dioxide is 
the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.

Appendix
55. Alphabet’s fiscal year runs from January 1 to December 31. Unless otherwise specified, reported data is global.
56. GHG emissions are calculated according to WRI’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol. For more information on our methodology, see Alphabet’s 2019 CDP Climate Change Report .
57. Since 2010, we’ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall carbon footprint. Up until 2015, there was no guidance 
from WRI on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity procured against 
electricity consumed (in MWh) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, WRI released new guidance for market-based Scope 2 accounting, which we 
adopted, starting with 2015 data. Our pre-2015 methodology differs from WRI’s in the use of residual mixes, which avoid double-counting of claimed renewable energy attributes.
58. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food from our corporate offices, 
hardware manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google’s 
hardware includes data center servers, networking equipment and consumer hardware products. These extended categories will be reported annually going forward.
59. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. Our 2016 operational emissions include Scope 1, Scope 2 
(market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting). For more information, see our 2017 white paper 10 Years of Carbon Neutrality .
60. See note 58 above.
61. See note 59 above.
62. See note 39 above.
63. Total energy consumption represents total Scope 2 electricity consumption plus total Scope 1 fuel use.
64. Power usage effectiveness (PUE) is an industry-recognized ratio to measure data center efficiency. For more information on our PUE and how we calculate it, see  
“Efficiency: How We Do It ” on our website.
65. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in MWh) purchased for our operations (i.e., renewable energy 
procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and residual renewable electricity delivered directly through the grid) with the total volume of electricity 
consumed by our operations.
63
Google Environmental Report 2019 Appendix66. To align with the method outlined in note 65 above, starting in 2016, we adapted our methodology for calculating total electricity obtained from renewable sources. Prior to 2016,  
we were not accounting for the residual renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity.
67. Waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery.
68. Decommissioning activity decreased in 2017 and 2018 because most of the decommissioning returns in this period were from an older generation of technology, which did not qualify 
for redeployment. 
69. Includes all water (both recycled and potable) consumed at offices and data centers.
70. Number of ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States only, which represent the majority of our electric vehicle charging ports in the United States. Emissions avoided are 
estimated using data from these ports only.
71. In addition to our renewable energy contracts, Google also invests in renewable energy projects around the world that have an attractive risk-adjusted financial return. These projects 
are not used to offset our carbon footprint.
