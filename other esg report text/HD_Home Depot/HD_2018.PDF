Corporate Responsibility6 2018 Responsibility Report Overview Our Operations Our People Our Products Our Business
The Home Depot was founded on eight core values and a leadership 
construct that we call the inverted pyramid, which puts customers and front-line associates /f_irst. These symbols guide our actions every day, from how we treat our associates, customers and communities to how we run our operations. They are the cornerstones of our unique culture.
Throughout this 
Responsibility Report , you’ll see examples of how 
we’re living our values by offering innovative and environmentally 
friendly products to our customers. You’ll read about how we’re reducing our energy usage and driving ef/f_iciencies throughout our supply chain. And you’ll learn how we’re continuing our focus on diversity and inclusion to create a great place to work and shop.
A few highlights:  
Diversity & Inclusion: More than 50% of our new hires were 
ethnically diverse, and at the time of this report’s publication, we announced an updated parental leave policy that gives six weeks  
of 100% paid leave to all parents, plus an additional six weeks of 100% paid maternity leave to all birth mothers.
Workforce Development: In 2017, we launched a pilot trades training 
program for separating military members in partnership with the Home Builders Institute (HBI) to help create the next generation of skilled tradespeople. In March of this year, The Home Depot Foundation announced a $50 million commitment to train 20,000 tradespeople over the next 10 years.  LIVING OUR VALUES
Community Support: We helped communities and associates during an unprecedented year for natural disasters. As part of the $63 million we granted overall to support our communities in 2017, The Home Depot Foundation gave over $4 million and volunteered thousands of hours to help communities affected by catastrophic hurricanes and wild/f_ires. In addition, our employee-relief nonpro/f_it, The Homer Fund, assisted more than 6,000 associates who experienced evacuations, as well as damage or loss of their homes.
Environmental: In 2017, our stores used 23.5% less electricity than 
in 2010. This means we surpassed our goal to reduce store energy use 20% by 2020 — and did it three years ahead of schedule.
As part of our values, we encourage our associates to be 
entrepreneurial, innovative and creative, and the successes you’ll see in this report are a testament to their talent and dedication. We are proud of their work, even as we look ahead with the understanding that there’s much more to do.
Thank you for your interest in our progress and our plans for 
improvement. I hope you will /f_ind this report informative, and,  
as always, we welcome your feedback.

The Home Depot was founded on 
eight core values that guide our 
everyday actions.8 2018 Responsibility Report Overview Our Operations Our People Our Products Our Business
As a retailer, we have relationships with a variety of stakeholders 
interested in how we’re running our business. Customers ask us questions when they walk into our stores or shop with us online. Citizens contact us with concerns. We meet with shareholders and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We take part in industry efforts to raise awareness about the social and environmental responsibilities we all share.
These formal and informal interactions help shape our priorities. So 
does our regular materiality assessment, which gauges the impact of our business. Together, they create a framework that our Sustainability Council uses to measure our progress and design ways to improve. The Council, composed of representatives from different areas of the business, focuses on seven key areas (see right).
The Council meets twice a year and its chairman presents our sustainability strategy and activities to the Board of Directors annually. Our priorities and plans are communicated through our company structure from leaders to associates. 
The process of evaluating the impact of our business is never complete. 
Technology, scienti/f_i  c developments, societal shifts and business innovations drive constant change. When we hear from concerned stakeholders, we take steps to educate them and monitor the issue or alter our path. We track and report on progress and set goals for improvement. 
We will continue to rely on our relationships with stakeholders to 
identify and meet the challenges and opportunities before us.Climate Change

regular materiality assessment gauges the impact of our business.10 2018 Responsibility Report Overview Our Operations Our People Our Products Our Business
At The Home Depot, we continually seek ways to align 
our operational strategies with technology and product improvements. It’s a smart way to do business, and it also creates a more sustainable world. But our sustainability efforts extend beyond our operations and into customers’ homes. As the world’s largest home improvement retailer, we are in a unique position to source products and foster ideas that not only reduce our environmental impact, but also help millions of customers reduce their impact.
Our sustainability assessments expand in scope and 
complexity every year, yet we keep showing improvements. Our efforts help customers clean, repair, remodel and build in ways that are better for their homes and businesses, as well as for our planet.
The Home Depot’s merchant teams work with our suppliers across 
industries to embrace processes that have positive, lasting effects. DOING THINGS 
BETTER EVERY DAY

to reducing the indoor air quality impact of the household cleaning, paint, carpet and insulation products we sell. This year, we asked suppliers to exclude additional chemicals from household cleaning products.
We also reviewed our global wood-purchasing policy and added 
stricter requirements for wood sourced from the Amazon and Congo basins, Papau New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Those requirements will take effect Sept. 1, 2018.
Our store operations team constantly strives for the complementary 
goals of improving ef/f_i  ciency and reducing our environmental impact. We seek alternatives such as wind, solar and fuel cells to reduce our emissions and encourage the continued development of cleaner energy. We’re closer to our goal of leveraging 135 megawatts of alternative and renewable energy by 2020.
Every day we open our doors determined to do things better — to 
build on our business success as we reduce our company’s and our industry’s environmental impact and improve the lives of people in the global communities we in/f_l  uence, support and serve.
Thank you for your time and interest in The Home Depot.

Strengthening our business by embracing 
our differences
Diversity is good for our communities, and it’s good for our 
business. Differences in thought, style, culture, ethnicity, age, gender orientation and experience are invaluable assets. Having a wealth of perspectives and experiences helps us make smarter strategic decisions, connect with our customers and build a workplace that attracts and retains talented associates.
We are committed to a culture that welcomes and accepts 
differences. For us, diversity re/f_l  ects our core values. We embrace it by integrating inclusive practices into our business processes, engaging and developing associates, building partnerships with diverse suppliers and supporting diversity in the communities we serve.DIVERSITY &

Hiring 
We understand that we succeed through people. Our diverse 
workforce of more than 400,000 associates strengthens our competitive advantage, maximizes shareholder investment and bene/f_its the communities we serve. Our workforce is more ethnically diverse than the U.S. working population, based on a comparison with U.S. Department of Labor data. We continue  
to make progress in our efforts to increase representation  in our executive ranks. Here are some of the ways we  foster an inclusive workplace:
•  Our chief diversity of/f_icer provides 
 focused leadership in developing a  workplace where all associates are  valued, respected and supported in  doing their best work.•  We have a section of our corporate website dedicated to 
 diversity, and we regularly participate in local and national    career fairs that attract diverse job candidates. 
 Retention  
All employees prosper through our robust development 
opportunities and bene/f_its, but we structure some programs speci/f_ically to support workforce diversity. Here are a few examples:DIVERSITY &  
INCLUSION
•  We connect with veterans and their spouses through our  
military transition portal. More than 35,000 veterans  
are employed by The Home Depot.
•  Our University Relations program recruits interns from diverse  
 backgrounds. In 2017, more than 220 students participated  
 in our summer internship programs across 10 business areas.  
•  We use social media, traditional advertising in multicultural 
markets and other outreach to target prospective associates.  •  Respect training is part of all associates’ curriculum. Our Store  
 Support Center leader development curriculum includes    inclusion and unconscious bias training.  
 •  Our Leaders Inclusion Network (Lead-IN) empowers associates  
    to lead inclusively by engaging and championing diverse talent.      Our Women in Leadership curriculum is among the developmental      content available to associates under Lead-IN. 
 
 •  Our SSC mentoring circles foster inclusion. More than half of the   participants are female, and more than half are ethnically diverse. 
 
•  Tuition reimbursement includes learning other languages.

The Home Depot is always looking for ways to understand 
and harness the power of leadership. A trend that kept emerging from operational data was that the most highly engaged stores were headed by strong leaders. While this wasn’t surprising, the challenge was how to de/f_i  ne — and then replicate — the leadership qualities that foster engagement and success.
Our internal research identi/f_i  ed four Leader Behaviors, 
Respect, Inspire, Develop and Celebrate, as being vital to creating highly engaged teams that are empowered to go above and beyond for our customers. The four Leader Behaviors are now integrated into our leaders’ development programs and are a core part of our Voice of the Associate survey. Associates are able to provide feedback on these behaviors, and 75% have a favorable view of how their leaders demonstrate these qualities.Spotlight: Measuring leadership success
Over 80% of 
associates report a strong commitment to their jobs, their leaders and the company.ASSOCIATE
ENGAGEMENT
Building a great place to work
We create an engaging and inclusive workplace by asking for 
and acting on associate feedback. We value how our differences contribute to uni/f_i  ed success. And we enable associates to share in the company’s /f_i  nancial achievements.
Voice of the Associate Survey
Our annual survey helps us determine how emotionally connected our associates are to their jobs, leaders and company. The most recent results were uniformly favorable, further supporting an increase in associate commitment that we have noted over the last several years. We use the results to help stores, warehouses and other locations improve associate and customer experiences. Our leaders also use the data for companywide assessments.
DID YOU KNOW?27 2018 Responsibility ReportAssociate Resource Groups
We engage associates and support an inclusive culture through associate resource groups (ARGs) connected to a single aspect of diversity. Championed by executive sponsors and advisers, each ARG highlights our commitment to diversity by engaging associates in professional development, awareness activities and community outreach. Our ARGs support the company’s business objectives and policies, particularly related to developing our associates, creating diversity awareness and engaging diverse community partners. Over 60% of our Store Support Center associates belong to an ARG.Success SharingOur philosophy of taking care of our people and motivating them to deliver a superior customer experience shapes our profit-sharing program for hourly associates. Success Sharing provides semi-annual cash awards for performance against our business plan, including sales and productivity goals. 
The outstanding performance of our associates in fiscal 2017 
enabled 99% of stores to qualify for Success Sharing in both the first and second half of the year. This resulted in bonus payments to our non-management associates of approximately $256 million.

Trainees are military members completing their service; they pay no fees to participate in the 12-week pre-apprenticeship, which combines work-based learning with technical and academic skills. The Foundation partnered with the nonpro/f_i  t Home Builders Institute to create the program, using a Department of Labor-recognized curriculum with an average job placement rate higher than 90%.
“We wanted to bring shop class back,” said Shannon Gerber, executive director of the Foundation. “We’re thrilled to train next-generation plumbers, electricians, carpenters and beyond. It’s a true honor to assist separating service members as they transition to civilian life and into successful careers in the trades.” The program will roll out to military bases across the U.S. in 2018. It’s part of the Foundation’s $50 million commitment to train 20,000 tradespeople by 2028 to help /f_i  ll the skilled labor gap.

Our products have the potential to drive signi/f_i  cant change. By 
selling greener products, we make customers’ homes greener, too. And that can make a difference to the health and well-being of millions of people and their communities.
In 2007, The Home Depot launched Eco Options
® to help our 
customers identify products that have less of an impact on the 
environment and to encourage our suppliers to provide more sustainable offerings. Ten years later, in October 2017, we published our Chemical Strategy.  It details our commitment 
to working with suppliers to reduce the indoor air quality impact of chemicals used in the products we sell. Its publication was a milestone made possible by what we had learned over a decade of focusing on sustainability.
We launched Eco Options in partnership with SCS Global Services, 
a leading, independent, third-party certi/f_i  cation body. For a product to be classi/f_i  ed as an Eco Options product, the supplier must document attributes that prove it has less of an impact on the environment than comparable products in the same category. Until all industries create and abide by a reporting formula that measures product attributes according to a common sustainability standard, we will continue to use our Eco Options program to help 
customers sort through green product claims.To determine whether products qualify for 
our Eco Options program, we consider their impact in one or more of ﬁ  ve key areas

Extending sustainability to customers’ homes  
At The Home Depot, we recognize the responsibility we  
have for the environmental impact of our organization — and  
that our biggest impact is the products we sell. In partnership 
with stakeholders throughout the supply chain, The Home Depot is committed to offering products that are safer for  
the environment. 
With our encouragement, our suppliers have been investing 
in developing environmentally innovative products. The Home Depot supports the work of the Green Chemistry & Commerce Council (GC3) through annual membership and participation in the Retail Leadership Council of the GC3, and we participated in developing the GC3’s 
Joint Statement on 
Using Green Chemistry and Safer Alternatives to Advance 
Sustainable Products .
We and our suppliers also partner with respected third-party certi/f_ication organizations and environmental nonpro/f_its that guide the home improvement industry toward safer chemical ingredient use. The Home Depot is committed to continuing the drive toward minimizing the environmental impact of the products we sell.CHEMICAL STRATEGY40 2018 Responsibility Report Overview Our Operations Our People Our Products Our Business

 air quality.
• We conduct periodic assessments of key categories to track  
 progress on environmental innovations in green chemistry.
The Home Depot will evaluate this strategy annually to  
ensure our approach and goals are appropriate and meet  
the needs of our stakeholders.41 2018 Responsibility ReportPaints

Pollinators are vital to local ecosystems, and we are committed to promoting products that help protect them. Our growers have pledged to discontinue the use of neonicotinoid pesticides by the end of 2018. We list our insecticide products online so our customers have the information they need to help them create pollinator-friendly gardens. Our Nature’s Nutrients line, grown without the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, is curated to include blooms that attract butter/f_l  ies and other pollinators.

Our Garden center watering innovations have saved more than 
250 million gallons of water47 2018 Responsibility ReportReuse and Recycling in Our Garden Centers
We’ve been helping our customers recycle their plastic planter pots since 2009. We collect pots (from THD and elsewhere) at our Garden center recycle stations and give them to our growers to reuse. If pots aren’t reusable, our growers sort them by resin type and deliver them to our designated supplier who, in turn, recycles them into new pots.
We’ve helped recycle more than 17 million pounds of plastic planter 
pots over the last eight years — more than 3 million pounds in 2017 alone. Our efforts have diverted more than 12,000 cubic yards of plastic from land/f_i  lls and created 23 million new pots. Some of the recycled plastic returns to THD as pots, trays and hanging baskets.
Spotlight: Hands-on sustainability keeps local nursery growing 
Rambo Nursery is a family-owned grower i n Cedartown, Georgia, 
that provides plants to 67 nearby Home Depot stores. Sam Rambo 
started the business in 1983, selling hanging baskets door to door. When he connected with The Home Depot, we had three Atlanta-area stores, and he was a one-man operation. Now his thriving nursery employs hundreds. 
Rambo grows his business with a view on sustainability. The 
nursery uses integrated pest management (IPM) techniques, including sanitation, crop rotation and preventive practices such as greenhouse screens. Workers don’t water after 2 p.m. to discouragefungus gnats. When needed, the nursery uses bene/f_i  cial nematodes to help control pests. Workers inspect plants several times a day, checking temperatures and removing dead foliage or errant stems. Before starting new crops, they remove remnants of previous crops, weeds, algae or green spots — cleaning surfaces and tools throughout greenhouses to discourage insects, mites, disease and the spread of pathogens.
When Rambo’s plants move to our Garden centers, his /f_i  eld 
employees take over, making regular visits to ensure the plants are healthy and well maintained. It’s a labor-intensive but successful business strategy. “Customers just want beautiful, healthy plants that are grown locally,” Rambo said.

Protecting and conserving precious resources
Water is essential to life and a signi/f_i  cant factor in economic 
health. We understand the responsibility The Home Depot has in protecting it — not only through our operations, but also through products we sell. We work with suppliers to ensure products re/f_l  ect our conservation values and help customers use less water.  
In 2017, we committed to helping customers save 250 billion 
gallons of water by 2020 through the purchase and proper use of WaterSense-approved products. We estimate our products helped customers save 79 billion gallons of water last year alone — nearly a third of our goal.
We partner with WaterSense, a program operated by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, to ensure our customers have access to water-ef/f_i  cient products. Products bearing the WaterSense label have been independently certi/f_i  ed to help save water.
In 2017, The Home Depot was named a WaterSense Partner of

Reducing emissions and customers’ power bills  
 
For more than two decades, The Home Depot has encouraged 
suppliers to make the products we sell more energy ef/f_icient. As a result, our customers have saved millions of dollars on utility bills and reduced emissions linked to powering their homes.
Energy-efﬁcient Products  
In 2017, we announced a commitment to help our customers 
save another $2.8 billion in energy costs by 2020 through the purchase and proper use of ENERGY STAR products. By the 
end of the year, we had sold over 171 million ENERGY STAR 
products, which we estimate saved our customers over $1 billion on annual energy utility costs — exceeding 35% of our 2020 goal. We estimate the drop in consumption helped customers reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 6.2 million metric tons. That’s equivalent to removing annual CO
2 emissions produced by nearly 670,000  
American homes. 
We promote ENERGY STAR awareness in our stores and online. 
For example, our popular DIY workshops teach customers how to save money and energy using affordable products and simple conservation practices.  
 
Our leadership in these areas has earned recognition year after 
year. We were named a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ENERGY
ENERGY STAR Retail Partner of the Year in 2017 — for the 11th year in a row. We also received the program’s Sustained Excellence distinction for the fourth consecutive year.  
 Solar Options  
We’re empowering our customers’ energy independence by making it easier than ever for them to produce solar energy. Since 2016, our solar partners have installed more than 250,000 kilowatts of clean energy through The Home Depot solar program.

The Home Depot’s packaging team constantly works with our 
private brand product suppliers to reduce the environmental impact of packaging. By applying science to package design,we continue to make progress in reducing waste while maintaining packaging effectiveness.
Using Less EPS
In 2017, our packaging team looked for substitutes for expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam. EPS foam is good at protecting products, but it contains beads of chemicals and oil that are often dif/f_i  cult to recycle and can take more than 500 years to biodegrade. 
We came up with a way to replace EPS with recyclable materials 
like molded pulp and paper in packaging for our private-label holiday product assortment. As a result, we eliminated 341,000 cubic feet of EPS foam from our packaging. That’s 355 Greyhound buses full of EPS foam kept out of land/f_i  lls.SUSTAINABLE

Living our commitment to ethical sourcing
We owe it to our customers, associates and communities to 
further the collective commitment to human rights, safety and environmentally sound practices through ethical sourcing. We engage our suppliers in this commitment by prioritizing the purchase of products made in factories that adhere to our  
social and environmental responsibility (SER) standards.
Our SER standards mandate that suppliers and factories abide by 
all applicable international and local laws, rules and regulations in the manufacturing and distribution of merchandise or services provided to us. We conduct audits around the world to ensure compliance with our SER standards.
Suppliers must keep on-site documentation that demonstrates 
compliance with our SER standards. They also must allow  
Home Depot associates and/or representatives full access to production facilities, worker records, production records and workers for con/f_idential interviews in connection with SOCIAL & 
ENVIRONMENTALRESPONSIBILITY
monitoring visits. We expect our suppliers to promptly correct  
any non-compliance, starting with timely preparation and  
presentation of a corrective and preventative action plan.
If suppliers fail to improve, we may terminate our business 
relationships with them. Equally important, we support factories  
that take action to create lasting social and environmental  
compliance programs. We encourage suppliers and factory  
workers to communicate concerns via processes outlined in  
our corporate Code of Conduct.
Our SER audits are designed to assess  
compliance in these areas:  
 
•     Laws and regulations  
•     Child and forced labor  
•     Harassment and abuse  
•     Compensation

Using the planet’s resources wisely
As the world’s largest home improvement retailer and an 
industry leader on sustainability issues, we have the ability to effect change by doing the right thing. 
To help protect endangered forests and to ensure that 
there will be timber for future generations, we formalized a Wood Purchasing Policy in 1999. Since then, we’ve led suppliers toward understanding and practicing sustainable forestry throughout the world. We give preference to wood from forests managed in a responsible way. Most of our wood comes from North American forests, which are expanding.
In 2017, The Home Depot announced that beginning on 
Sept. 1, 2018, we will not accept wood products from Papau New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the South American Amazon Basin or the African Congo Basin, unless the Forest Stewardship Council has certi/f_i  ed the products. FSC certi/f_i  cation ensures products come from responsibly managed forests that provide environmental, social and economic bene/f_i  ts.SUSTAINABLE

Encouraging responsible practices  
by our suppliers
Our company expects all suppliers that manufacture our products 
to provide appropriate information and conduct due diligence to enable our compliance with con/f_lict minerals laws. We also expect these manufacturers to obtain products and materials from suppliers that are not involved in funding con/f_lict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining covered countries. We partner with our private brands and proprietary product suppliers whose products contain tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold (referred to as 3TG) to identify the source of any of  
these minerals in the supply chain.
2017 Progress  
As detailed in The Home Depot’s conﬂict minerals report  
for 2017, our efforts focused on collecting and disseminating 
information about sourcing practices of our Tier 1 suppliers. We cataloged that information in a database using the con/f_lict minerals reporting template developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (formerly the Con/f_lict-Free Sourcing  
Initiative, or CFSI).
We continued to re/f_ine our supplier review processes for Tier 1 
suppliers by excluding any that merely af/f_ixed company brands, CONFLICT MINERALS 
trademarks, logos or labels to generic products manufactured by a third party, as permitted by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidance. As a result, in-scope Tier 1 suppliers decreased to 212 in 2017 from 321 in 2016.
Through our due diligence process, which aligns with guidance from 
the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, 
we received 100% participation from our in-scope private brands  
and proprietary suppliers.
Twenty-six percent of our Tier 1 suppliers indicated that one or more 
con/f_lict minerals were necessary to the functionality or production of covered products. Of the veri/f_ied smelters or re/f_iners reported by these suppliers, only 60 out of a total of 308 sourced con/f_lict minerals from covered countries. All but two of these smelters or re/f_iners were members of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (founded by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition and Global e-Sustainability Initiative), the London Bullion Market Association and/or the Responsible Jewellery Council and were certi/f_ied as DRC con/f_lict-free by the respective organization.
We work closely with our suppliers to ensure they implement 
responsible sourcing and encourage their smelters to obtain a “con/f_lict-free” designation from an independent  
third-party auditor.57 2018 Responsibility Report

ASSOCIATE SAFETY
Taking care of our people
At The Home Depot we continually strive to create a safer place to 
shop and work. To do this, we focus on awareness and training, leadership engagement and innovations for reducing injury risk.
We continue to make progress on safety, and when we do have an 
incident, we learn from it. We’re constantly improving our training programs and how we communicate risk awareness and safety practices with associates and customers. Our injury rates are consistently lower than industry averages for our retail class.NUMBERSBy the

2018 Responsibility Report SMART ENERGY USE
Shrinking our carbon footprint through 
conservation and innovation
The Home Depot leads by doing, and that’s re/f_l  ected in how we 
reduce our energy consumption; support efforts to make the energy supply more reliable and ef/f_i  cient in the communities we serve; and support alternative energy innovations that are shaping the future.
In 2017, our stores used 23.5% less electricity than in 2010. That 
means we surpassed our stated goal to reduce store energy use by 20% — and did so three years ahead of schedule. Last year alone, store energy consumption dropped 3.2%. 
Conservation
The simplest way to reduce emissions from energy use is to use less energy. At The Home Depot, we maximize that strategy, constantly looking for ways to cut consumption and improve ef/f_i  ciencies. Our efforts are good for our business, as well as the environment. We achieve results by making improvements kilowatt by kilowatt, year after year. For example, in 2017 we installed energy-ef/f_i  cient heating, air-conditioning and ventilation systems in an additional 91 stores.Demand MitigationBy participating in demand mitigation programs run by electric utilities or grid operators, we reduce electricity costs and have an impact on balancing energy supply and demand. It works like this: During peak demand, utilities or grid operators strategically divert electricity, reducing the chance of outages and optimizing the cost of electricity. In addition, at nine stores in California, we use on-site batteries to store electricity during off-peak times for use when demand rises. Both types of demand mitigation help defer construction of new power plants.

2018 Responsibility Report66 2018 Responsibility Report Overview Our Operations Our People Our Products Our Business
Alternative Energy
We support and tap into sustainable energy that’s produced off-site and on-site. All of these sources bring us closer to our goal of leveraging 135 megawatts of alternative and renewable energy by 2020. In addition, when The Home Depot buys or produces alternative energy, we strengthen the business case for such alternatives — leveraging our size, reach and brand recognition to drive positive change.
• Off-site wind: In early 2017, we became a customer of the Los Mirasoles Wind Farm northeast of McAllen, Texas. The energy purchased from the farm is enough to power 100 stores. We also began purchasing power from the Zopiloapan Wind Farm in central Mexico later in the year.
• Off-site solar: Last year, we signed on with a community solar provider in Minnesota, expanding our support of similar initiatives in Delaware and Massachusetts.• On-site solar: We started 2017 with four operational rooftop solar farms. By the end of the year, we had launched 34 new projects and obtained permits for three more. (See our spotlight on the next page for details.) 
• Fuel cells: We cut polluting emissions signi/f_i  cantly — in some cases by 50% — when our stores use fuel cells instead of traditional power sources. These mini power plants were installed outside 178 THD stores by the end of 2017, producing roughly 90% of the electricity needs of each store. Fuel cells are a good option for stores with aging roofs that will need to be replaced within 15 years; that’s how long a rooftop solar project needs to stay in place to yield an appropriate return on investment. More fuel cell installations are underway at stores in 2018.

interactive infographic highlighting energy-saving and other sustainability enhancements we’re using in some stores.
SMART ENERGY USE67 2018 Responsibility ReportLong-term Savings  
We continue to bene/f_it from previous years’ investments, 
such as: 
• Installing upgraded building automation systems in all U.S. and Canadian stores in 2013 and 2014
• Retro/f_itting lighting in more than 1,300 stores, converting from 6- to 4-lamp /f_ixtures 
• Installing variable frequency drives (VFDs) in more than 600 stores to ensure motorized equipment only uses the electricity needed to meet immediate demandsSpotlight: Powering up the big box with sunshine  
 
The average Home Depot store is about 104,000 square feet, 
meaning there’s more than a soccer /f_ield of space on the roof of each one. In 2017, we launched projects to transfrom 34 of those rooftops into solar farms. By the end of the year, 38 stores in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were capturing energy from the sun. These zero-emissions solar farms reduce each store’s annual electricity grid demand by an estimated 30-35%. That’s the equivalent of powering 2,300 average U.S. homes for a year. 
Permitting slowdowns delayed some installations planned in 2017; 
these projects continue in 2018. The goal is to have sun-fueled power plants atop more than 50 stores.

SmartWay Recognition
In 2017, The Home Depot was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2017 SmartWay
® 
Sustained Excellence Award for the /f_i  fth consecutive year. We earned this recognition through clean transportation best practices. Our ongoing Supply Chain Synchronization initiative has enabled us to optimize the way we store and move products, reduce truckloads by /f_i  lling trucks more ef/f_i  ciently, lower our fuel consumption and emissions and more.
The Home Depot was a charter member of the SmartWay 
program, which since 2004 has helped its partners avoid emitting 103 million tons of polluting emissions into the air. Through SmartWay, we participate in greenhouse gases data collection and reporting and encourage others to, as well. We require all THD carriers to be SmartWay partners, and we audit our carriers annually to ensure their data is properly submitted to the EPA. The Home Depot is proud to be among the EPA’s 3,500 SmartWay partners, and we’re honored to be one of only 11 that earned the program’s excellence distinction for shipping in 2017.

shareholder value while supporting management in running 
business and operations, observing the highest ethical standards and adhering to laws of jurisdictions where we operate.  
At least once a year, our Board discusses our sustainability strategy and activities, including this report.
Leadership Structure  
We believe having a combined chairman, chief executive of/f_icer 
(CEO) and president; an independent lead director; and Board committees composed entirely of independent directors currently provides the best Board leadership structure for The Home Depot.

practices, provides independent oversight of management while ensuring strategic alignment throughout the company.• Directors are elected annually via majority voting 
• Shareholders can act by written consent and call special meetings
• Shareholders have a proxy access right

Our enterprise risk framework is used to identify and manage  
our key risks. It enables us to consider external and internal 
factors that could distract the company from our business or derail strategic objectives. The Board reviews the framework and key risks annually, and the Board and/or appropriate committees discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year.
Board Committees & Risk Oversight  
The Board of Directors has established four standing committees  
comprised solely of independent directors and governed by a 
written charter that sets forth purpose, composition, powers, duties and responsibilities. The Board’s oversight of risk is accomplished by identifying key risks facing the company and mapping those risks to the appropriate Board committee and/or to the full Board, based on the nature of the risk.  
The standing committees and examples of their key oversight areas include:
• Audit Committee—oversees the company’s major /f_inancial exposures and compliance risks and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them; also oversees risks related to data protection and cybersecurity and our social environmental responsibility (SER) programOur proxy statement offers more details about 
corporate governance and risk management. Go to our Corporate Governance Overview 
for additional information on our corporate governance practices. • Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee—reviews and makes recommendations to the Board about policies concerning corporate social responsibility (CSR) matters; reviews the company’s political contributions and payments to trade associations that engage in lobbying
• Leadership Development & Compensation Committee—oversees risks related to compensation programs, including the company’s compensation policies and practices and our diversity and inclusion efforts
