The Home Depot     2020 Responsibility Report OverviewStrengthen  
Our CommunitiesFocus on  
PeopleOur  
BusinessOperate  
SustainablyReporting  
Framework
The Home Depot’s corporate responsibility 
strategy is values-based and centered 
on three key pillars: focusing on people, 
operating sustainably and strengthening 
our communities. We believe that our 
commitment to continuing progress on 
environmental, social and governance 
issues has made our company stronger, 
deepened our relationships with our 
associates and customers, made a lasting 
positive impact on the environment and 
created long-term shareholder value. 
As we focus on people, more than 33% 
of our hires were female and more than 
50% were ethnically diverse at the close 
of 2019. Yet we know we have more to do, 
and we have a renewed urgency in light of 
events of 2020. The continued senseless 
killings of defenseless Black men and 
women in our country demonstrate that 
we are far from fulfilling the promise of 
equality for all. Our company opposes 
discrimination, period, and we are 
committed to taking action to help end 
it. To that end, we have established an 
executive-led task force to further expand 
on our past work and recent actions to 
strengthen African American communities, 
combat all forms of discrimination and 
deepen our diversity.In 2019, we made important strides 
in operating more sustainably, and 
we continue to look to the future by 
setting significant goals to reduce our 
environmental impact. For example, we 
have pledged to reduce our carbon dioxide 
emissions by 50% by 2035. In 2019, we 
reached an important milestone on this 
front by reducing our CO2 emissions by 
10%. Our U.S. stores now use 35% less 
electricity than they did in 2010. 
We also set a new goal to procure or 
produce 335 megawatts of renewable or 
alternative energy by 2025. Additionally, 
we committed to eliminating expanded 
polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) film from our private-brand 
products by 2023. We’re grateful to our 
suppliers for their close partnership on this 
important goal. Our Chief Sustainability 
Officer and Vice President of Environmental 
Ron Jarvis provides additional insights on 
our sustainability efforts in an FAQ in  
this report. 
To support our communities, The Home 
Depot Foundation continues to make 
a difference by improving the homes 
and lives of U.S. veterans, assisting 
communities affected by natural disasters 
The Home Depot’s 
commitment to 
environmental, social and 
governance progress reflects 
our core values and makes 
our company stronger. CEO LETTER
OUR CORE VALUES  
IN ACTION
– Craig Menear, Chairman, CEO and President“I want to thank our associates for their contributions 
to our progress through 2019 and for shining more than 
ever during recent challenging times. Once again, they 
are putting our values into action.”5

and training skilled tradespeople to fill the 
labor gap. In 2019, the Foundation furthered 
its promise to invest $500 million in veteran 
causes by 2025, and our associates 
volunteered 315,000 hours on Team Depot 
projects in their communities.
Finally, throughout the COVID-19 crisis, 
we have been committed to the safety and 
well-being of our associates and customers, 
while remaining open to provide essential 
products and services to our communities. 
To that end, as of this writing, we have 
provided more than $1 billion in expanded 
benefits to support our associates and 
contributed more than $50 million to support 
our communities, including by donating 
personal protective equipment (PPE) to first responders and health care workers. 
More than 95% of our stores have donated 
essential supplies in their communities.
I want to thank our associates for their 
contributions to our progress through 2019 
and for shining more than ever during 
recent challenging times. Once again, they 
are putting our values into action.

ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS  
& SETTING PRIORITIES
As a retailer, we have many levels of 
responsibility for the impact of our 
business practices. We try to see those 
responsibilities not only through our lens, 
but also through others’ points of view. 
Customers ask us questions when they 
walk into our stores or shop with us online. 
Citizens contact us with concerns. We meet 
with shareholders and nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs). We take part 
in industry efforts to raise awareness 
about the social and environmental 
responsibilities we all share.
These interactions may be informal or 
formal, as detailed in our Materiality 
Assessment Framework on the following 
pages. Together with our regular materiality 
assessment, they help us gauge the impact 
of our business, set priorities, measure our 
progress and design ways to improve.This understanding of our impact and 
collaboration with our stakeholders 
enables us to set objectives that improve 
the sustainability of our operations and 
maximize our influence in developing 
sustainable products for our customers. 
Our Sustainability Council, composed 
of representatives from different areas 
of the business, oversees our approach 
to sustainability. The Council focuses on 
seven key areas, as shown on these pages.
The Council meets twice a year, and 
its chairman presents our sustainability 
strategy and activities to the Board of 
Directors annually. Our priorities and 
plans are communicated to leaders 
and associates in appropriate groups 
throughout the company.

Chief Sustainability Officer Ron Jarvis has 
spent two decades driving sustainability 
improvements at The Home Depot. Some 
of the frequently asked questions he 
responds to offer insights into our progress. FAQ: CONTINUING  
THE MOMENTUM
Our investments to 
reduce The Home 
Depot’s environmental 
impact yielded results in 
2019, and that progress 
continues.How does The Home Depot 
measure its impact on the climate, 
and what progress did the company 
make in 2019?
We track our carbon dioxide emissions 
from distribution, store energy use and 
more, using metrics that are industry 
standards:
• Scope 1: Direct emissions 
from combustible sources and 
refrigerants
• Scope 2: Indirect emissions from 
purchasing electricity
• Scope 3: Emissions from 
upstream transportation and 
distribution of freight 
We reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions 10% and Scope 3 emissions 
1% in 2019, compared to the year 
before. We remain committed to 
future progress. The Home Depot has 
pledged to reduce CO2 emissions 
2.1% per year, with the ultimate goal of 
achieving a 50% reduction by 2035.What’s driving improvement?
We’re reducing our carbon footprint 
in many ways, but changes in the 
way we distribute goods and 
use energy are yielding some of 
our biggest results. For example, 
by packing trailers in ways that 
maximized available space, we were 
able to avoid sending about 10,500 
truckloads of products on the road — 
saving 15 million driven miles in 2019. 
Our U.S. stores reduced electricity 
consumption by 383 million kilowatt 
hours, a decrease of 12% year over 
year. We are ahead of our 2020 goal 
to achieve a 20% reduction in store 
kilowatt-hour energy use, compared to 
2010 consumption.
What is behind the company’s 
push to reduce single-use 
plastics? What are the results 
so far?
As scientists continue to study the 
impact plastic has on our environment, 
particularly our oceans, we better 
understand why it’s important to 
reduce single-use plastics. We’re 
approaching that reduction in a 
few ways. We are partnering with 
suppliers to improve products and 
packaging. Those efforts eliminated 
1.44 million pounds of plastic and Q.

2020 Responsibility Report     The Home DepotDescribe the progress The Home 
Depot is making to lower the 
environmental impact of products.
We understand that our biggest 
impact on the environment comes 
from the products we sell. So, we 
constantly look for ways to improve. In 
2019, we eliminated perfluoroalkyl and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAs) from 
carpets and rugs sold in the U.S. and 
Canada. It’s part of the commitment 
outlined in our Chemical Strategy, 
which guides our efforts to work with 
suppliers to reduce the indoor
air quality impact of chemicals used 
in the products we sell. Since we 
outlined the strategy in 2017, The 
Home Depot has eliminated a number 
of suspect chemicals in carpet, 
flooring and insulation, and we are 
ahead of our stated goals to make our 
paints and cleaning products greener.How does the Eco Options 
product classification work?
Our Eco Options® program is our 
effort to better define and clarify 
manufacturers’ green-product claims. 
For a product to receive Eco Options 
classification, the supplier must 
document attributes that demonstrate 
the product has less of an impact on 
the environment than comparable 
products in the same category. We 
have a unique opportunity to educate 
the thousands of customers who 
shop with The Home Depot every day. 
Just knowing the potential impact of 
certain products or how we use them 
can help all of us make better choices 
about how we use energy, water and 
chemicals in our homes. replaced another 7.73 million pounds

other outreach to target prospective 
associates.

Our Team Depot volunteer associates 
work on projects that make a difference 
for veterans in their communities. 
The Home Depot Foundation funds 
programs that improve the lives of 
veterans through access to better 
housing, support services and career 
opportunities; the Foundation has 
pledged to invest $500 million in veteran 
causes by 2025. Veterans organizations 
and the USO are among nonprofits for 
which our company matches associate 
donations dollar for dollar, up to $3,000 
per associate. Our company employs 
over 35,000 veterans and further 
supports military families by recruiting 
and recognizing the service of military 
spouses. Look for the U.S. veteran and 
military spouse badges on their orange 
aprons.  
 
In 2019, we launched a Military 
Relations department to become an 
even better workplace and resource for 
veterans, active-duty service members 
and their families. We believe The 
Home Depot is uniquely positioned to 
have a positive impact through internal 
support and external advocacy. Through 
our network of over 2,000 stores and 
facilities, we also help fulfill military 
spouses’ need to have stable careers 
amid frequent moves. 
 
We’re doing this because it’s the right 
thing to do, but it’s also good for our 
business. Veterans and their families 
share the core values that are the 
foundation of our Home Depot culture. SOur new Military Relations department is fine-tuning our focus on supporting

DESIGNING A CAREER
The next time you walk into a Home 
Depot store, think about Sarmistha Boal, 
our director of new concept development. 
She and her team likely influenced 
the design of the entrance facade, the 
checkout pods and almost everything in 
between.
After coming to the United States 
from India in 1988 to pursue a master’s 
degree from the Savannah College of 
Art and Design, Boal took a job in the 
flooring department of a Home Depot 
store in Atlanta. Soon her responsibilities 
expanded from sales to envisioning Expo 
Design Centers, a chain of décor concept 
stores we operated from the late 1990s to 
the late 2000s.
Boal kept moving up in store design, 
despite pressures of what she describes 
as a very male-dominated industry 
at the time. She earned respect by 
being passionate about her work. “That 
transcends everything,” Boal said. She 
also was buoyed by The Home Depot’s 
close-knit and entrepreneurial culture, 
and how our company valued the global 
perspective she brought to her work. She 
was assigned to positions of increasing 
responsibility in the U.S. and in posts in 
Mexico, Canada and China.Today, she and the Atlanta-based team 
she leads dream up sustainable, high-
performing and cost-effective designs 
that balance merchandising demands 
with associate safety. They often make 
their ideas come to life using products 
sold in our stores. 
The team finds inspiration everywhere, 
in the sleek designs of high-end car 
dealerships, the modularity of port-
a-potties and more. But their biggest 
influence is Boal’s firsthand knowledge 
of what it takes to serve customers in 
our aisles. As she said: “I got to work 
with people who lived and breathed 
the products. That experience was 
incredible.”37

our Voice of the Associate survey once a 
year. The survey helps us determine how 
emotionally connected our associates are 
to our customers, the company, their jobs, 
and fellow associates and leaders. We’re 
using the feedback we received from 
over 350,000 associates in 2019 to help 
improve the associate experience. 
 
Through the years, our company has 
maintained a positive sentiment with Associate engagement is 
the emotional commitment 
associates have to our

Our philosophy of taking care of our 
people and motivating them to deliver 
a superior customer experience shapes 
our profit-sharing program for hourly 
associates. Success Sharing provides 
semi-annual cash awards for performance 
against our business plan, including sales 
and productivity goals. The program has 
granted awards totaling more than  
$1 billion to associates over the last  
five years.
The outstanding performance of our 
associates in fiscal 2019 enabled 100% 
of stores to qualify for Success Sharing in 
both the first and second half of the year. 
This resulted in bonus payments to our 
non-management associates of more than 
$200 million.
In addition, in 2019, we established a merit-
based salary increase of between 2.5% 
and 3%, and we continued our practice of 
making matching contributions under the 
FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan. We also provided 
recognition and team-building awards to 
reward top-performing associates.eventsAssociate Resource Groups

he breast cancer diagnosis was the first 
shock. Then, a month later, the clinic 
where Dee Thompson was about to 
start radiation treatment said her health 
insurance had been canceled. 
“I just melted down,” recalled Thompson, who has 
worked for The Home Depot for more than 20 years.
Exactly what caused the insurance disruption is 
unclear. Thompson was about to transfer from Store 
977 in Parsippany, New Jersey, to Store 1122 in 
Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, when doctors told her 
she had cancer. Perhaps a data-input error related to 
the transfer was to blame. 
What is certain: Murrells Inlet Store Manager Mike 
Callan, Assistant Store Manager Linda Keefer and 
Associate Support Department Supervisor Faith 
Murphy all stepped up to help. And Lesley Leiserson, 
senior director of Benefits & Health Management at 
the Store Support Center, made the problem go away.
“Lesley told me, ‘Don’t worry about it. We’ll take care 
of it.’ It was seamless. It really was,” Thompson said.T

FOR ASSOCIATES
The Homer Fund makes a difference in the lives of our people every day.
fter Jo began caring for her 
11-year-old nephew, she 
discovered that he was 
behind on vaccinations 
required for school and needed lots of 
dental work. But because Jo was not 
Juelz’s legal guardian, her Home Depot 
health insurance didn’t cover his care. 
Jo, who works in the Store Support 
Center in Atlanta, brainstormed with 
her manager about what to do and 
discovered expanded assistance first 
made available in 2019 under The Homer 
Fund’s Direct Grant program. 
“When we pulled up the Homer Fund 
website to look at what would be the 
best option, we realized that an increase 
in family members actually now qualifies 
for a Direct Grant,” Jo said. The Homer 
Fund helped pay for Juelz’s missing 
vaccines, as well as dental work — 
including a root canal — needed to 
address decay from seven untreated 
cavities. 
The Homer Fund is powered by 
associates to help associates. Every 
dollar donated goes to co-workers in 
need. The Fund receives more than 1,000 
requests for assistance each month to 
help orange-blooded families like Jo’s.
“I see the progress, and I see that Juelz 
is changing,” Jo said. “We’re family, 
and I believe family is everything. And I 
think we needed him just as much as he 
needed us.” 
Jo said it’s reassuring to know The 
Homer Fund is there for all associates. 
“You just never know when you will need 
it or what it will mean to somebody.” A
ASSOCIATES IN NEED CAN BENEFIT FROM ONE OR BOTH OF 
THE FOLLOWING HOMER FUND PROGRAMS:
Direct Grants help associates through tragic events such as the death of a parent 
or child, natural disaster, illness or injury, a spouse’s layoff or company closure 
and more, up to $10,000.
Matching Grants are a unique way the Fund recognizes the generosity of 
associates toward one another. When associates pass the hat for a co-worker in 
need, their money is matched by The Homer Fund — $2 for every $1 associates 
collect, up to $5,000 or the associate’s actual need.
In 2019, the Direct Grant program expanded to assist with even more life events, 
such as paying for an increase in family size because of the unforeseen guardianship 
of a family member, funeral expenses following the death of a parent and more.48

anticipating and identifying risks through 
cross-functional partnerships that include 
our associates, customers, vendors 
and suppliers. We seek innovations that 
prevent injuries and align with our core 
value of caring for our people.  
Reducing Risk
Striving for a zero-injury workplace 
requires removing risk from our stores 
and distribution centers. In 2019, we 
launched a methodical approach to 
identifying and abating risk as new 
operational and merchandising processes 
are developed. As a result, we’re 
designing out hazards, adding needed 
controls and increasing our ability to alert 
associates about risks — all before new 
processes make it to our aisles.
Increasing Associate Awareness

real-time safety information to associates 
and connects them to company leaders 
who reinforce and personalize our 
commitment to safety. We use multiple 
types of media to accommodate 
associates’ preferences and learning Our people are our most 
important asset. By 
focusing on workplace 
safety training and 
risk reduction, we help 
keep our associates and 
customers injury-free.styles. And the friendly competition we 
foster between stores — for example, 
through membership in Club 365, 
exclusively for stores that have been 
injury-free for a year — encourages safety 
compliance by appealing to our orange-
blooded associates’ competitiveness.
Simplifying Support Materials
We’re reducing complexity in our safety 
information and messaging, moving

PROTECTING THE CLIMATE
ENERGY USE
Prioritizing Conservation
The simplest way to reduce emissions 
from energy use is to use less energy, and 
in 2019, we made significant progress. We 
reduced U.S. store electricity consumption 
by 383 million kilowatt hours, compared 
to reduction of 98 million kilowatt hours in 
2018. Our energy use decreased even as 
we added three new U.S. stores to  
our footprint. 
In 2019, electricity consumption by our 
U.S. stores was 35% less than in 2010. 
That put us ahead of our stated 2020 
goal to achieve a 20% reduction in store 
kilowatt-hour energy use, compared to 
2010 consumption. In 2019 alone, U.S. 
store energy consumption dropped 12% 
year over year. 
Our substantial energy-saving progress 
in 2019 was led by the continued 
installation of LED lighting across our U.S. stores. Several years ago, we began 
updating our lighting from 6-lamp to 4-lamp 
fixtures, which significantly reduced our 
energy consumption. We learned from 
those improvements, and then we began 
converting our stores to LED lighting fixtures 
that are even more efficient. So far, about 
60% of our U.S. stores have undergone LED 
upgrades. 
We also installed energy-efficient heating, 
air-conditioning and ventilation systems in 
102 U.S. stores in 2019. Over the last eight 
years, we’ve updated HVAC units in 576 
stores.
We continue to benefit from earlier initiatives 
to install upgraded building automation 
systems in all U.S. and Canadian stores and 
add variable frequency drives (VFDs). In 847 
stores, VFDs conserve energy by ensuring 
equipment uses only the electricity needed 
to meet immediate HVAC demands.Improving the efficiency 
of our operations is good 
for our business and 
the planet. The Home 
Depot’s investments 
make alternative energy 
solutions more viable.

More than 750 stores participate in demand 
mitigation to help balance power supply 
and demand. It works like this: During 
peak demand events, utilities or grid 
operators call on users like The Home 
Depot to reduce demand. By lowering 
our consumption during these events, we 
help reduce the chance of regional power 
outages, while also optimizing the price we 
pay for electricity.
In addition, we use on-site batteries to 
store electricity during off-peak times for 
use when demand rises. At the end of 
2019, batteries were in place in 52 stores: 
23 in California, 13 in Massachusetts, 13 in 
New York and three in Connecticut. We’re 
installing more in 2020.Making Every

Leveraging Alternative and 
Renewable Energy
We support and tap into sustainable 
energy that’s produced off-site and on-
site. Not only does it expand our energy 
options and reduce our carbon footprint, 
but when The Home Depot buys or 
produces energy from renewable 
sources, we strengthen the business 
case for such alternatives.
• Off-site wind: In early 2017, we 
became a customer of the Los 
Mirasoles Wind Farm northeast 
of McAllen, Texas. The energy 
purchased from the farm is enough 
to power 105 stores. We also 
purchase power from the Zopiloapan 
Wind Farm in central Mexico.• Off-site solar:  We contract with 
solar energy providers in Delaware, 
Massachusetts and Minnesota. Our 
support boosts the viability of solar 
power in these areas.
• Fuel cells: At stores where rooftop 
infrastructure won’t support solar 
panels, we’re looking at other 
alternative energy options, including 
fuel cells. These mini power plants cut 
polluting emissions significantly — in 
some cases by 50% — compared 
to using traditional power sources. 
By the end of 2019, fuel cells were 
operating outside 204 stores. The fuel 
cells produce more than 90% of each 
store’s electricity needs. More fuel  
cell installations are in development  
in 2020.

SOURCING RESPONSIBLY
ETHICAL SOURCING
We owe it to our customers, associates 
and communities to further the collective 
commitment to human rights, safety and 
environmentally sound practices through 
ethical sourcing. We engage our suppliers 
in this commitment by purchasing products 
made in factories that adhere to our 
responsible sourcing standards. We report 
on our progress in an annual Responsible 
Sourcing Report.
Our Responsible Sourcing Standards  
mandate that suppliers and factories 
abide by all applicable international 
and local laws, rules and regulations in 
the manufacturing and distribution of 
merchandise or services provided to us. We 
conduct audits around the world to ensure 
compliance with our responsible sourcing 
standards.
Suppliers must keep on-site documentation 
that demonstrates compliance with our 
responsible sourcing standards. They also 
must allow Home Depot associates and/
or representatives full access to production 
facilities, worker records, production 
records and workers for confidential 
interviews in connection with monitoring 
visits. We expect our suppliers to promptly 
correct any noncompliance, starting with 
timely preparation and presentation of a 
corrective and preventative action plan.If suppliers fail to improve, we may 
terminate our business relationships with 
them. Equally important, we support 
factories that take action to create lasting 
social and environmental compliance 
programs. We encourage suppliers and 
factory workers to communicate concerns 
via processes outlined in our corporate 
Code of Conduct. 
Our responsible sourcing audits are 
designed to assess compliance in  
these areas:  
 
•     Laws and regulations
•     Child labor
•     Forced labor
•     Harassment and abuse
•     Compensation
•     Hours of work

Our company expects all suppliers that 
manufacture our products to provide 
appropriate information and conduct 
due diligence to enable our compliance 
with conflict minerals laws. We also 
expect these manufacturers to obtain 
products and materials from suppliers 
that are not involved in funding conflict 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(DRC) and adjoining covered countries. 
We partner with our private brands and 
proprietary product suppliers whose 
products contain tin, tungsten, tantalum 
or gold (referred to as 3TG) to identify 
the source of any of these minerals in the 
supply chain.
2019 Progress
As detailed in The Home Depot’s Conflict 
Minerals Report  for 2019, our efforts 
focused on collecting and disseminating 
information about the sourcing practices 
of our suppliers. We cataloged that 
information in a database using the 
conflict minerals reporting template 
developed by the Responsible Minerals 
Initiative® (formerly the Conflict-Free 
Sourcing Initiative, or CFSI).
We continued to refine our review 
processes for suppliers and exclude any 
that merely affixed company brands, 
trademarks, logos or labels to generic 
products manufactured by a third 
party, as permitted by U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission guidance. 
As a result, in-scope Tier 1 suppliers 
decreased to 71 in 2019 from 153 in 2018.CONFLICT MINERALS  SOURCING RESPONSIBLY
Through our due-diligence process, 
which aligns with guidance from the 
Organisation for Economic Co-Operation 
and Development , we received 100% 
participation from our in-scope private 
brands and proprietary-product Tier 1 
suppliers.
Forty-four percent of our Tier 1 suppliers 
indicated that one or more conflict minerals 
were necessary to the functionality or 
production of covered products. Of the 
smelters or refiners reported by these 
suppliers, only 45 out of a total of 289 
sourced conflict minerals from covered 
countries. All but one of these smelters or 
refiners were certified as DRC conflict-free 
by the Responsible Minerals Initiative, the 
London Bullion Market Association and/or 
the Responsible Jewellery Council. 
We continue to work closely with our 
suppliers to ensure they implement 
responsible sourcing; obtain current, 
accurate and complete information 
about the supply chain; and encourage 
their smelters to obtain a “conflict-free” 
designation from an independent third-
party auditor.We work with our

SUSTAINABLE FORESTRYSOURCING RESPONSIBLY
As the world’s largest home improvement 
retailer and an industry leader on 
sustainability issues, we have the ability 
to effect change by doing the right thing. 
To help protect endangered forests and 
to ensure that there will be timber for 
future generations, The Home Depot first 
issued our Wood Purchasing Policy in 
1999. Since then we have successfully led 
our suppliers toward understanding and 
practicing sustainable forestry throughout 
the world.
Today, we have broadened our focus 
to understand the impact of our wood 
purchases in all regions and to embrace 
the social and economic issues that must 
be considered in recognizing endangered 
regions of forests.
 Building on the Journey
Our research has taught us much about 
the world’s forest coverage by country. 
This helps guide our supply chain 
decisions.  
The vast majority of our wood product 
purchases originate from North American 
forests. These are some of the most 
sustainable forests in the world. The 
United States now grows more trees 
for wood than at any time in the last 60 
years, according to data from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture.
 We track our wood 
purchases in all 
departments, from 
lumber to tool handles, 
to help protect forests 
and ensure future 
availability of timber.
247,000Forest coverage in North 
America grew over
acres from 2010 to 2015,
according to the most recent 
data from the U.N. Food & 
Agriculture Organization.69

initiatives as varied as reducing 
plastics in products, offering wood 
products from sustainable sources 
and improving distribution  
efficiencies to conserve fuel.TPriorities that emerged from the world’s largest sustainable-building 
conference are already shaping how we do business.GREENBUILD COMES

Greener Products
Consumers’ standards are higher than 
ever when it comes to understanding 
where their products are coming 
from, what’s in them and how they are 
produced. That’s the motivation for our 
Eco Options program, which helps 
customers identify products validated 
as having reduced impact on the 
environment. It’s also what’s behind 
our Chemical Strategy, which guides 
our efforts to work with suppliers to 
reduce the indoor air quality impact of 
chemicals used in the products we sell.
Reducing, Reusing and 
Recycling
An alternative economic model, 
circular economy, got a lot of buzz 
at Greenbuild. The approach aims to 
limit — and ultimately eliminate — 
waste generated from products and 
packaging. We’ve added Circular 
Economy to our Eco Options pillars 
to fine-tune our focus on eco-friendly 
products. In addition, we’re innovating 
our packaging and recycling more 
from our operations every year to 
reduce waste.Want to know more?

SUPPLY CHAINSOURCING RESPONSIBLY
Our One Supply Chain strategy drives 
efficiency and sustainability. It’s supported 
by Project Sync, our multiyear, omnichannel 
initiative that identifies better ways to move 
our products. Our progress is driven by 
entrepreneurial ideas and innovation.
For example, we’re employing predictive 
analytics to better forecast the future 
using data from sales, consumer trends, 
weather patterns, supply chain disruptors 
(like COVID-19) and more. We’re shifting 
management of some product distribution 
from our suppliers to our own supply chain 
associates, gaining greater end-to-end 
visibility, control over transportation modes 
and efficiencies that reduce miles and 
emissions.By making our supply 
chain more efficient, we 
reduce business costs 
and the impact that our 
product distribution has 
on the environment.
Discover some of the 
ways we improved our 
supply chain in 2019:More than 300 hydrogen fuel 
cells provided emissions-free fuel 
for forklifts at our facilities in Troy 
Township, Ohio, and Savannah, 
Georgia, reducing energy use by 
nearly 4 million kilowatt hours 
every year.Predictive analytics enabled us to 
shave 13% off the time it takes 
to move goods from distribution 
centers to stores, decreasing 
emissions from trucks.DID YOU KNOW

2020 Responsibility Report     The Home Depot
Applying advanced analytics 
to inventory calculations 
decreased product storage 
time by 1.2 days, even as 
customer demand grew. That 
reduced our facilities’ energy 
consumption and emissions. By optimizing how we loaded 
products into trailers, we 
maximized loads — avoiding 
emissions from about 
10,500 trucks traveling  
15 million miles.We sold available space on our 
trucks and bought space from 
other companies, ensuring fewer 
underloaded trailers hit the road. 
That space sharing saved about 
1.8 million driven miles.
Optimizing Every Load
Products on pallets are easier to 
load and unload but don’t use all 
available trailer space. By partnering 
with suppliers to forgo pallets, we 
can stack products to the top of the 
trailer, resulting in as much as a 40% 
reduction in truck space needed to 
transport some goods.
At our inbound freight consolidation 
facilities, we’re using technology tools 
to optimize product storage and flow, 
reducing inventory, increasing our 
speed to market and ensuring more 
trucks depart fully loaded.
Maximizing Every Mile
Our technical fleet optimization team 
does a week-ahead, technology-
assisted assessment of scheduled 
pickups and deliveries, then prescribes 
each driver’s path to reduce miles 
traveled, fuel consumed and trucks 
on the road.
To ensure our fuller trucks are burning 
fuel efficiently, we use an artificial 
intelligence tool to set the engine 
utilization grind for optimal truck 
performance based on load weight.
We developed a way to use our order 
tracking technology to identify 
“orphan” products. Those goods hitch 
a ride on a truck already going to the 
right destination.

Eco Options
Our Eco Options  program helps our 
customers identify products that have 
less of an impact on the environment and 
encourages our suppliers to provide more 
sustainable offerings. We launched Eco 
Options in 2007 in partnership with SCS 
Global Services, a leading, independent, 
third-party certification body that validates 
environmental claims. 
For a product to receive Eco Options 
classification, the supplier must document 
attributes that prove it has less of an impact 
on the environment than comparable 
products in the same category. Until all 
industries create and abide by a reporting 
formula that measures product attributes 
according to a common sustainability 
standard, we will continue to use our Eco 
Options program to help customers sort 
through green product claims.

We introduced Circular Economy as The 
Home Depot’s sixth Eco Options pillar 
in 2019. It reflects our aim to prevent 
products and packaging from becoming 
trash. The foundation comes from nature: 
Nothing is wasted, and everything is 
regenerative.
We encourage supplier innovation in 
product and packaging design, material 
selection and manufacturing. We also 
strive to offer products that have a 
positive environmental impact. We carry 
more than a million products, and many 
have the potential to move our economy 
toward circularity.
We also look for opportunities within 
Home Depot operations to reduce, 
repair, reuse and recycle. The goal is to 
extend our planet’s natural resources and 
protect land and water from the impact of 
material disposal.
Along with our suppliers and vendors, 
we are developing our thinking and 
capabilities in an effort to:
•   Design with the environment in mind
•   Eliminate excess materials
•   Eliminate materials that are not readily 
     reusable or recyclable
•   Minimize mixed materials to make 
     disassembly and recycling simpler
•   Use materials that are biodegradable  
     or readily recyclable
•   Use recycled content when possible

supports those efforts, too. 
In 2019, we offered over 24,000 Energy Star

over 240 million units of these products. 
This furthered our stated goal to help our 
customers save $2.8 billion in energy costs 
by 2020 through the purchase and proper 
use of Energy Star products. 
We estimate that this also helped our 
customers cut energy consumption  
10 billion kilowatt hours in 2019, saving over

The Home Depot’s packaging team 
works with our private-label product 
suppliers to apply science to creating 
better packages. Our goals are to 
reduce package footprints and use more 
sustainable materials.
Using Less EPS
In 2019, our packaging team continued 
a multi-year effort to find substitutes for 
expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam. EPS 
foam is good at protecting products, but 
it contains beads of chemicals and oil that 
are often difficult to recycle and can take 
more than 500 years to biodegrade. 
 
We’re replacing EPS with recyclable 
materials like molded pulp and paper in 
some private-label packaging. The effort 
has been so successful that we have 
less EPS to eliminate every year. In 2018, 
we eliminated more than 517,000 cubic 
feet — enough to keep six Olympic-size 
swimming pools of EPS foam out of 
landfills. In 2019, we removed over 19,000 
cubic feet of EPS from our packaging — 
enough to fill eight school buses.REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
SUSTAINABLE  
PACKAGING
Our packaging 
innovations decrease 
waste, boost shipping 
efficiency and reduce 
product damage. That’s 
good for the environment 
and our business.Reducing Polyvinyl Chloride
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film is widely used 
in packaging. The thin, rigid synthetic 
plastic polymer is molded around 
products to protect them from damage. 
But PVC film is difficult to recycle and 
takes a long time to biodegrade. So, we’re 
working hard to use less of it.

4 REASONS WE’RE PILOTING 
PAPER PALLETS
Solid wood pallets have long been the norm for shipping The Home Depot’s private-brand products. But it 
takes a whole tree to make just eight wooden pallets. So, in 2019 we tried an innovative change: using paper 
pallets made from recycled corrugated fibers. Here’s why we’re expanding our use of paper pallets in 2020: 
7 to 9 pounds
lighter than wooden pallets

FOUNDATION
The Foundation works 
to improve the homes 
and lives of U.S. 
veterans, train skilled 
tradespeople to fill the 
labor gap and support 
communities affected by 
natural disasters.Support for Veterans
Since 2011, The Home Depot 
Foundation® has invested more than 
$335 million to support U.S. veterans. 
During that time, we’ve provided financial 
support to improve 47,000 veteran homes 
and facilities — 5,500 in 2019 alone. The 
projects have helped veterans in 4,500  
U.S. cities. 
 
These investments tie into the Foundation’s 
stated commitment to give half a billion 
dollars to veterans’ causes by 2025.
Trades Training Program
The Home Depot Foundation has pledged 
$50 million to train 20,000 tradespeople 
by 2028 to help address the skilled trades 
labor shortage and provide a path to high-
quality jobs. To help veterans, transitioning 
military members and their spouses train 
for the trades, the Foundation partnered 
with the Home Builders Institute (HBI) on a 
trades training program taught at military 
bases. Participants pay no fees. Over the 
last two years, close to 800 graduates 
have left the program with skills needed to 
launch careers as plumbers, electricians, 
carpenters and more. 
 
In its hometown of Atlanta, the Foundation 
also has partnered with the nonprofit 
Construction Education Foundation of 
Georgia (CEFGA) in a separate trades 
training program, Construction Ready Plus. 
This program helps residents of the city’s 
Westside community expand their skills in 
construction. 
 
In 2019, the Foundation pledged $1.9 
million over three years to CEFGA’s K12 
Pipeline program. It trains students for careers in the trades. The training aligns 
with science, technology, engineering, 
arts and math (STEAM) initiatives that 
are a cornerstone of today’s educational 
priorities. It’s an educational model that 
could expand to other states. See the story 
on the next page to learn more.
Assistance After Natural Disasters
In 2019, the Foundation gave $3.5 million 
to help communities recover from natural 
disasters — assisting people displaced by 
tornadoes and flooding, recovering from 
wildfires and rebuilding after hurricanes. 
 
We work with nonprofit partners, including 
All Hands and Hearts, the American 
Red Cross, Convoy of Hope, Operation 
Blessing, Team Rubicon and ToolBank 
Disaster Services, to assist affected areas. 
In addition to financial support, Team Depot 
associate volunteers work alongside these 
organizations to help communities in need.

TEACHING THE TRADES
Investing in a trades training program in Georgia schools helps the construction industry find workers 
and empowers young people to build careers debt-free.
he construction industry 
needs skilled workers. Young 
people need multiple ways 
to build good careers. The 
Home Depot Foundation is helping make 
a match.
The Foundation is investing $1.9 million 
in Construction Education Foundation 
of Georgia’s K12 Pipeline, which trains 
students to become tradespeople. 
 
 
Training 20,000 by 2028
The funding, which stretches over three 
years, is part of the Foundation’s  
$50 million commitment to train 20,000 
tradespeople for the construction 
industry’s labor pipeline by 2028. It 
bolsters the Foundation’s commitment to 
communities, as well.
“We’re thrilled to take this next step 
in our trades training program,” said 
Heather Prill, senior manager of strategic 
partnerships for the Foundation. “This 
program will prepare students to be 
career ready and support their economic 
advancement.”  The Marcus Foundation and the Arthur M. 
Blank Family Foundation also have pledged 
three-year commitments of $1.9 million 
each. This is the first partnership among 
the three organizations, which will give a 
combined $5.7 million to support the K12 
Pipeline program.
Model for Other States
CEFGA will use the foundations’ funds to 
increase the number of industry-certified 
high school construction programs 
in Georgia from 40 to more than 80. 
Elementary and middle school construction 
programs will grow from nine to at least 
20 across the state. The program will 
provide training and industry credentials 
to more than 17,500 students in Georgia 
and place at least 3,500 of them into work-
based learning and full-time employment 
opportunities in construction.
The program partners with the Georgia 
Department of Education and employers 
across the state. It’s being evaluated as a 
model for training students for the trades in 
other parts of the country.
The K12 Pipeline program helps students build debt-free careers.“I like the challenge it 
places on my brain — 
trying to figure out what 
needs to be accomplished 
to achieve a common 
goal with the team.”

stores are among the last to close. And 
we’re among the first to reopen as soon 
as it’s safe for our associates to return

to stores in areas affected by natural 
disasters, particularly hurricanes. We take 
pride in setting the example for disaster

DID YOU KNOW
THD’s disaster response 
capabilities date back to 
1992, when Hurricane 
Andrew devastated South 
Florida. That’s when 
we fully grasped how 
integral our stores were to 
community recovery.

Every disaster highlights the strength and value of our 
fine-tuned response. We know how to prepare and react, 
which is why our associates are quick to rally when disaster 
strikes — as more than 200 Team Depot volunteers did 
after a tornado hit Dallas in October 2019.
In 2019, we delivered enough disaster relief supplies to fill over

The Home Depot’s partnership with disaster 
relief nonprofit Team Rubicon aligns with our 
commitment to communities and veterans. 
Team Rubicon’s mission is to leverage veterans’ 
military skills to keep doing good work after 
tours of duty end.
The organization was founded in 2010 by 
two U.S. Marines who rallied veterans, first 
responders and medical professionals to go 
to Haiti to aid the island’s recovery from 
a devastating earthquake. Team Rubicon 
volunteers — 70% of whom are veterans — 
donate their time, experience and leadership 
to help communities recover from disasters.
Our Team Depot associate volunteers work 
alongside Team Rubicon crews, and The Home 
Depot Foundation contributes $1 million a 
year to the organization’s efforts.PARTNERS IN SERVICE125

Our Business Code of Conduct and Ethics  
provides straightforward information about 
The Home Depot’s operating principles 
and offers tools to help associates make 
decisions that align with our ethical and 
legal obligations. The code applies to 
associates worldwide, and the company 
expects them to comply with the code and 
with all applicable laws and regulations 
in countries in which we do business. In 
particular, the code outlines The Home 
Depot’s ethical and legal standards in  
these areas:We empower associates to speak up 
when our ethical standards are not 
being met. We encourage them to voice 
concerns, express doubts, discuss 
problems and ask questions. In addition 
to sharing concerns with any member 
of their management team or a human 
resources partner, associates can report 
ethical or legal concerns to our Associate 
AwareLine, a 24/7 hotline. Reports can be 
made via thdawareline.com  or through a 
live operator available in local languages. 
Associates may remain anonymous when 
reporting concerns. Reports are handled 
using a case management system. We 
have a longstanding policy that prohibits 
retaliation for making a report.

The Home Depot has a long-standing 
commitment to strong corporate 
governance, which promotes the long-
term interests of shareholders, strengthens 
Board and management accountability, and 
helps build public trust in the company. 
Our Board of Directors has adopted 
policies and processes that foster effective 
Board oversight of critical matters such as 
strategy, risk management, financial and 
other controls, compliance, culture and 
management succession planning.
At least once a year, our Board discusses 
our sustainability strategy and activities, 
including this report.
Leadership Structure
We believe having a combined chairman, 
CEO and president; an independent Lead 
Director; and Board committees composed 
entirely of independent directors currently 
provides the best Board leadership 
structure for The Home Depot. 
This structure, together with other 
robust corporate governance practices, 
provides strong independent oversight of 
management while ensuring clear strategic 
alignment throughout the company.CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE
Our corporate governance policies 
reflect best practices:
• Annual election of directors 
• Majority voting standard in 
uncontested director elections 
• Shareholder ability to call special 
meetings and act by written consent
• A market standard shareholder right 
of proxy access 
• Independent Lead Director 
• Approximately 92% of directors and 
all Board committee members are 
independent 
• Independent directors meet without 
management 
• Mandatory retirement age for directors 
• Annual Board strategy session and 
review of the company’s strategic plan 
• Director overboarding policy 
• No shareholder rights plan, also 
referred to as a “poison pill” 
• Store-walk policy for directors 
• Board education and orientation 
program 
• Management succession policy 
set forth in Corporate Governance 
Guidelines 
• Annual Board and committee self-
evaluations, including individual 
director interviews with the

2020 Responsibility Report     The Home DepotBoard Committees
Our Board of Directors has established four standing committees, each comprised solely of independent directors and 
governed by a written charter that sets forth its purpose, composition, powers, duties and responsibilities.
Board Oversight of Risk
The company has a robust framework designed to identify and ensure proper management of risk, including risk relating to 
our ability to operate responsibly and sustainably. The framework used to identify and manage risk considers enterprise-
level issues, including competitive environment, brand and reputation, regulatory and compliance, and security. The 
framework also considers external and internal factors that could distract from or derail strategic objectives. The Board 
oversees risk through this framework, with oversight accomplished by identifying key risks and mapping them to the 
appropriate Board committee or to the full Board. 
Our Board reviews these key risks and the related framework annually, and the full Board or appropriate Board committees 
discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year. The table below identifies key risk areas overseen by the Board 
and its committees.BOARD OF DIRECTORS

We actively participate, and encourage 
our associates to participate, in the 
political process. Our Political Activity 
and Government Relations Policy 
provides the framework for our political 
activity. We engage in three key ways:
• Our Government Relations department 
protects and expands our company’s 
ability to take care of our associates, 
customers and shareholders 
through effective regulatory and 
legislative action. Our Government 
Relations team works to optimize the 
government’s impact on the business 
through effective lobbying, relationship 
building and political engagement.
• We have a political action committee 
(PAC) that connects our salaried 
associates to the political process 
and pools their personal contributions 
to financially support pro-business 
candidates who understand issues 
of importance to The Home Depot 
and our associates. As a long-GOVERNMENT  
RELATIONS
The Home Depot 
recognizes that laws at 
the federal, state and 
local level impact our 
business. standing practice, we do not contribute 
to presidential campaigns or endorse 
presidential candidates.
• The Home Depot supports trade 
associations that advocate on behalf of 
the business community and retail sector 
and reports annually the aggregate dues 
paid to those associations that engage in 
lobbying activities.
In deciding where we want to focus our 
advocacy, these are some of our top 
priorities:
• Driving sales by ensuring online-only 
marketplaces follow the same rules 
on accountability and transparency as 
interconnected retailers
• Supporting our One Supply Chain 
initiative by advocating for funding for 
roads, ports and bridges and for laws 
that allow safer, heavier trucks to reduce 
loads and our environmental footprint

• Protecting margins by working to get 
laws passed that target sophisticated, 
organized retail crime rings to reduce theft 
and support free trade
• Taking care of our people by making sure 
we have a say in laws that could affect 
associate flexibility and career growth
Oversight of Our Political Activity
Our Government Relations department, led 
by a vice president who reports to our general 
counsel, manages our political activity. The 
team carefully analyzes our engagement 
activities, trade association partnerships 
and political contributions, keeping in mind 
our key priorities. The Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee of 
our Board of Directors provides additional 
oversight, conducting an annual review of 
the company’s political contributions and 
payments to trade associations that engage 
in lobbying activities. 
 
The Home Depot PAC’s finances, governance 
and communications are governed by a 
PAC Board. The PAC Board is chaired by 
the vice president of Government Relations 
and is made up of representatives from 
each functional area of the business and 
each field division to ensure a wide range of 
experiences and perspectives.   
 
We provide transparency in our actions by 
publishing annual reports of the company’s 
political contributions and the aggregate 
dues paid to trade associations that 
engage in lobbying activities. We list trade 
associations to which our company makes 
yearly payments of $5,000 or more, and our 
PAC contributions are publicly available on 
the Federal Election Commission website.PATH OF THE PAC DOLLAR
