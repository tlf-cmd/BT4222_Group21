I Overview 
At Facebook, we believe sustainability is about more than operating 
responsibly. It's an opportunity to support the communities we're a 
part of and make a bigger impact on the world. 
We believe that climate change is an urgent issue facing the world today 
and we are commit ted to doing our part to address this cha lenge. That is 
why we're working to minimize the impact of our energy, emissions and 
water usage, protect workers and the environment in our supply chain, 
and partner with others to develop and share solutions for a more 
sustainable word.

Four of our data center buildings in the U.S. officially 
earned LEED Gold certification. Our second building 
in Lu lea, Sweden is our first to achieve LEED 
Platinum, the highest rating possible. SUSTAINABLE WORKPLACES 
We created a new sustainable design program for 
new offices, leading to three LEED certifications. We 
also partnered with our employees to host 40 events 
across 25 global offices in celebration of Earth Week. 
04 I 77 Letter from Rachel Peterson, Vice President of Infrastructure 
At Facebook, sustainability means more than operating 
responsibly and minimizing our environmental impact -it 
means having a positive effect on communities around the 
world and within our supply chain. In the last decade, 
climate change has become one of the most urgent global 
challenges. We are committed to help tackle this challenge -
not only by minimizing our environmental impact -but by 
connecting people around this topic and building solutions. 
This inaugural "Sustainability Report" provides a closer look into our sustainability progress in 2019, as 
well as our broader commitment to address climate change. We've come a long way since we 
announced our first sustainability commitment to support our operations with 100 percent renewable 
energy in 2011 and supporting the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017 by joining the We Are Still In 
Coalition. 
In 2019, we made significant progress toward our 2020 climate and renewable energy goals, reaching 
59 percent reduction in our operational greenhouse gas emissions over 2017 levels and achieving 86 
percent renewable energy. We have also accelerated our support in local communities, including 
investing in water projects that will restore 206,000 cubic meters of water per year in our data center 
communities and financing projects that strengthened the renewable energy market. 
We are also excited about the positive impact that collaborations and partners hips have in 
addressing this global challenge. In 2019, we collaborated with academic and nonprofit partners to 
develop the Climate Conversation Map. This innovative new tool will allow partners to better 
understand how climate discussions are unfolding around the world on the Facebook opp, providing 
insights to help inform and spur further climate action. We're excited to see how new solutions like this 
can positively impact communities around the world. 
All that said, we know there is more work to be done. Now more than ever, businesses need to think 
not only about managing their operational impact but about working with others to leverage their 
technical strengths to address sustainability challenges. For us, this means driving down our 
emissions, supporting the renewable energy transition, deepening supplier partners hips to advance 
positive impact and leveraging our platforms and technology to scale innovations that drive climate 
action.

Reducing Our Carbon Footprint 
Throughout our global operations, we've taken action to minimize our environmental footprint by setting a science-based target of 
reducing our operational (Scope l and 2) greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent by the end of 2020, compared to our base year 
of 2017. 
Within a year of our 2018 announcement to reduce emissions, we realized a 42 percent reduction from our 2017 levels, despite 
growth in our business As of the end of 2019, we were well on our way at 59 percent reduction, compared to 2017 levels -equivalent 
to 364,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions. Although not part of our original 2018 commitment, we have also begun reporting on We're well on our 
way to our 
some key Scope 3 activities, including business travel, employee commuting and construction impacts.

Increasing Climate Resilience 
As we continue to expand our operations, we 
understand the importance of strengthening our 
resilience and adaptation to climate-related hazards 
and natural disasters. In 2019, our climate risk 
assessment portfolio grew to 260 total sites, including 
data centers, offices and supplier locations, looking at 
risks such as sea level rise, heat stress, typhoon and 
hurricanes and water stress 1•8�j

This approach is especially important for facilities in regions already severely impacted by extreme weather events and climate change. 
Our global Sustainability team uses these insights to identify opportunities to incorporate climate-related considerations into our overall 
sustainability strategy, advancing progress across key areas such as water stewardship and sustainable building design. 
For our global supply chain, we use the same risk-based approach to help our suppliers understand and minimize their environmental 
impacts. Through similar climate-related risk assessments that we do for our own operations, we work closely with suppliers to ensure 
they are prepared for the climate risks they face -such as sea level rise, heat stress and water stress -and have climate resilience 
integrated into their emergency planning and business continuity practices. 
For the first time in 2019, we offset emissions from employee business travel for some teams, as well as air travel to 11 major internal 
events. As a result, we offset more than 100,000 metric tons of carbon emissions -equivalent to taking 22,000 passenger cars off the 
road for a year. 
Partnerships to Scale Impact 
In addition to the We Are Still In coalition, we were proud to support bills like H.R. 9 in the U.S, the 176th Congress (2019-2020): Climate 
Action Now Act. We participate in the UN's annual session of the Conference of Parties (COP), working closely with the UNFCCC to drive 
virtual engagement with the public. We also participate in Greenpeace's Clicking Clean Initiative, receiving an "A" rating for our efforts 
to accelerate the global transition to a more greener internet.

�5 Supporting Our Opera\ions with 100 Percent Renewable Energy 
In 2077, Facebook was one of the first companies to commit to supporting our facilities with 700 percent renewable energy. We have 
since set an aggressive goal to support our global operations with 700 percent renewable energy from 2020 onward. As of the end of 
2079, we are proud to say that we are 86 percent of the way there. I I I

In 2079, we were a leading corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally, recognized as the #l corporate buyer of renewable 
energy in the US by the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance and #2 in the world by Bloomberg NEF Last year, we also committed to our 
first direct investment in a renewable energy project with the 300 MW Prospero Solar Project in Texas. Facebook is the sole tax equity 
investor and will be purchasing the majority of the renewable energy attributes from the project. 
Adding to Local Grids Around the World 
Globally, at the end of 2019, we had more than 5 GW of renewable energy projects under contract and over 7.3 GW of projects online 
generating clean electricity in support of Facebook's operations. In 2019 alone, we contracted for 7.7 GW of new renewable energy 
projects. Facebook has contracted for enough renewable energy to power more than 1.6 million U.S. households.7

We contribute to local communities by adding new renewable energy capacity to the same electricity grids as the data centers they 
support. In certain regions, our operations are also benefiting local communities by contributing to the region's efforts to address 
environmental challenges. 
For example, our data center in Odense, Denmark includes infrastructure to capture and deliver heat generated by our servers to the 
district heating system, operated by a local district heating company. The project is currently ramping up to provide 100,000 MWh of 
energy per year -enough to warm 6,900 homes in the neighboring community. Our project is helping the city to accelerate its efforts to 
phase out the use of coal by summer 2022 ahead of the initial goal of 2030.

Driving Industry Access to Renewable Energy 
Beyond efforts to support our global facilities with renewable energy, we are committed to continue strengthening renewable energy 
markets around the world and supporting the clean energy transition. We strive to increase access to renewable energy resources for 
other companies and organizations through green tariffs, added infrastructure, or providing access to a specific project. Our direct 
investment in the Prospero Solar Project is another example of our efforts to help unlock new options for more organizations to meet 
their own renewable energy goals and grow the market. 
In 2019, of our total 7.7 GW of new contracted renewable energy projects, we executed l GW of contracts in partnership with four local 
utility providers including Dominion Energy (Virginia), Rocky Mountain Power (Utah), Pacific Power (Oregon) and Walton Electric 
Membership Corporation (Georgia). Additionally, we partnered with our colocation service provider, Digital Realty, on the first 
back-to-back utility-scale renewable energy transaction by a data center provider landlord linking renewable energy supply directly to 
an end customer. 
We share results and exchange ideas with peers through participation on the Board of Directors of the Renewable Energy Buyers 
Alliance, RE-Source and the American Council on Renewable Energy.

Bancroft Station Solar 
Facebook's first solar project in the state of Georgia, Bancroft Station Solar, began operations in 
December 2019 The proJect hos yielded tangible economic benefits across the state, with our 
partner employing more than 675 people to construct the project using locally-manufactured 
PV modules. 
The project incorporates an innovative approach that creates more than 20 additional 
long-term, high-value jobs in a rural, economically distressed county, while keeping the property 
in agricultural production and generating significant environmental benefits 
Adaptively-managed grazing livestock, diverse plant life, pollinator habitat and wildlife all work 
together to revitalize degraded soils, enhance biodiversity, increase the ecosystems' resilience, 
improve the watershed, and sequester carbon in the soil.

Our renewable energy procurement has also resulted in substan tial water savings when compared with sourcing energy from the 
standard utility energy mix. In 2019 alone, our water savings totaled 77 million cubic meters (over 3 billion gallons) 
We publicly report our water data, including water withdrawal and consumption from both data centers and facilities, and the data is 
third-par ty verified. We have measured and reported on our water withdrawal for years but in 2078 started reporting our consumption 
as well. As a metric, water withdrawal tells us how much water we purchase for our operations, but a large amount of that water is 
returned to local wastewater treatment plants and can be used again further downstream. Water consumption tells us what we 
actually evaporate in our operations and gives us a better idea of our true impact. 
Restoring Local Watersheds 
Given that water is a shared resource, we strive to be a good steward in the 
communities where we operate by investing in projects that restore local watersheds. 
For facilities that are located in water-stressed regions, we support water restoration 
projects that promote long-term sustainability of local watersheds. In 2079, we 
invested in four new water restoration projects in New Mexico and Oregon, restoring 
206,000 cubic meters/year (54,525,000 gallons/year) of water in our data center 
commu nities, bringing the total cumulative volume contracted to 683,000 cubic 
meters/year (780,535,000 gallons/year) of water at the end of 2079. Middle Rio Grande Restoration Project

Leveraging Data for Good 
We use de-identified, aggregated data to develop and release new features on our platform that allow users to commu nicate with 
friends and family during times of crisis and natural disasters. In 2014, we debuted Safety Check to allow Facebook users to let their 
network know they are safe while in crisis zones. In 2017, our Data for Good team launched Disaster Maps �thelp first responders and 
humanitarian organizations quickly assess the impact of natural disasters on a region, providing real-time /J
hsights that allow for more 
dynamic responses and effective deployment of aid to vulnerable commu nities. ) 
In 2019, we began developing the Facebook Climate Conversati on Map, a new tool that will provide organizations with information to 
advance climate action, including insight into what drives climate conversations and how they ebb and flow through out the world and 
over time. Using data science research, computing power and anonymized platform data that are aggregated weekly, the map provides 
partners with a way to understand the level of engagement with climate-related news in various regions. 
Informed by and available to academic and NGO 
partners like the World Resources Institute and The 
Yale Program on Climate Change Commun ication, 
the Climate Conversation Map is an example of how 
collaboration plays an important role in Facebook's 
approac h to innovation. In addition to the joint effort 
between multiple teams at Facebook, we worked 
closely with partners to refine the tool and 
companion tools like the CrowdT angle Climate 
Conversati on Live Disp lay. This publicly available 
dashboard searches for "climate change" and 
"global warming" in the same 21 languages used in 
the Climate Conversation Map.

At Facebook, our people are our greatest assets, and the fight against climate change is a great example of how our employees have 
come together to put their passion and technical skills to use. In 2019, our Sustainability team hosted the first Sustainability Hackathon to 
accelerate the development of climate solutions. This hackathon approach allowed us to evolve project ideas into viable products and 
test opportu nities to launch on Facebook's family of apps. Facebook engineers and designers across the company participated in this 
initial hackathon, working with the team to bring four project ideas to life. 
Our teams also work closely with other organizations to help them better understand and use our capabilities to advance their 
sustainability efforts For example, our Social Good Partnerships team helps nonprofit organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund, 
The Nature Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup, leverage Facebook's platform for their fundrais ing and marketing efforts. By 2019, 
our platforms raised more than $2 billion in support of nonprofits and causes that are important to our users. Since 2017, there are no 
fees associated with donations made through our Fundraising tool to charitable organizations, resulting in 100 percent of the funds 
raised going directly to the nonprofits being supported. 
As we continue to advance our own operational efforts and work with others, the need and demand for more innovative solutions to 
drive climate awareness and impact will only increase. According to our latest Topics and Trends Rep ort, which analyzes topics of 
conversations on our platform across various countries and cultures, sustainability emerged as one of the top five key macro-level 
trends to watch, demonstrating a growing behavioral shift in how people respond to sustainability-related topics and issues.

FACE BOOK Sustainability I Sustainability Report 2019 12 / 17 Responsible Supply Cha in 
We strive to ensure safe, healthy and fair working conditions for all workers 
within our global supply chain, while minimizing our environmental footprint. 
Through a Respo nsible Supply Chain program, we engage mea ningfu lly and proactive ly with Facebook 's supply chain partners, build 
supplier capa city and respond quickly to chal lenges as th y arise 
Setting Standards for Our Suppliers 
We developed a framework of standar ds and expec tations to guide our supplier busi ness relationshi ps, including through adoption of 
the Responsible Busine ss Allianc e Code of Conduct, which sets out standar ds on labor , envir onmen t, heal th and safety, ethics and 
man agemen t syste ms To effect ively prio ritize our efforts, risk assessme nts ore conducted to help us map and identify the most critical 
issues areas and supplier s. We proac tively engage with supplier s through dialogue , independen t audits and assessme nts and colle cting 
worke r sentimen t to under stand issues that are most relevant to their individ ual work environm ents. Additional ly, Face book 's Electronics 
Reus e and Recy cling Standar d provides expec tations for recyc lers that man age the end -of-life treatment of our hardwar e. 
Engaging Suppliers More Deeply 
Enhanc ing the well-being and livelihoods of work ers, as well as the envir onmen t, in our supply chain is at the core of our program. In 
2019 , we partnered closely with our prior ity supplier s to addr ess areas that have the greatest impact and pote ntial to create lasting 
change We made progress in advancing visibili ty into social and envir onmen tal issues with in our supply chain and deep ened supplier 
partnershi ps, expandin g supplier engagemen t through a program that is focused on direct feedback from worker s via surveys. We used 
sentimen t and insights from thes e surveys to help supplier s impr ove man agemen t syste ms and working cond itions, taking a holistic 
approach that include d on-site consulting, training, awa reness building and other activities. 
We work to understand our supplier s' envir onmen tal chall enges and help to reduce their impac t by collecting data to see wher e and 
how we can engage with them mor e deep ly. Our supplier s' envir onmen tal data are benchma rked agai nst our standar ds and we tailor 
our approach based on the matu rity of their sustainability strategy. Dep end ing on the supplier need, our program engagemen t ranges 
from buildin g capaci ty on data reporting to supp orting on-site ener gy assessmen t to identify energy reduction opp ortuni ties. 
In 2019, we launched a program to ensur e suppli ers would be prepar ed for the climate risks they may face, sharing key learnings from 
our own oper ations. Implemen ting the same risk-based approach we use to eva luate our own oper ations, we conduc ted a physical 
climate risk assess ment of our global manu factu ring supply chain footprint, looking at risks such as sea level rise, heat stress, typhoon 
and hurricanes and water stress. We partner ed with supplier s facing some of the highest risks to ensu re they had clima te resilienc e 
integrated into their emergenc y plann ing and busi ness continuity practices. 
Partnering with Others to Drive Industry Change 
Beyo nd our own oper ations , we continue to look for ways to collabor ate and shar e ideas with others, developing solutions that promote 
best practices for o responsible supply chain We ore memb ers of the Responsible Busine ss Allianc e, o multi-sta keholder initiative 
ded icated to adv ancing sustainabili ty global ly, the Resp onsible Minerals Initiative and the Respo nsible Labor Initiativ e. 
In May of 2019 we filed our annual Conflict Minerals disclosure. In June of 2019 we issued our annual Anti-Slavery and Human 
Traffic king Statement that outli nes our commitmen t, policies, and practices to prevent and addr ess forced labor issues in our supply 
chain. Public disclo sures like thes e advance transpar ency and accoun tability in this space. 
FACE BOOK Sustainability I Sustainability Report 2019 13 / 17 Sustainable Data Centers 
Since breaking ground on our data center in Prineville, Oregon in 2010, sustainability and 
efficiency have been core drivers o_f how we design, build and operate our infrastructure. 
We incorpor ate a compr ehe nsiv e set of sustainao le design elemen ts and cons truction practices that conser ve energy and water , sour ce 
mat erials responsib ly, create hea lthy workspaces and keep waste out of landfills by recy cling as much as possi ble. Now with 15 data 
center s globally -both on line and under construction -we oper ate some of the most sustainable data centers in the world. 
Building Sustainable Data Centers 
Ener gy efficiency and renewa ble energy are the founda tions of our data center sustainabili ty strategy. Thank s to smar t design 
decisions that add up across the full stack of technolo gy inside them -from the servers that keep our platform running to the syste ms 
that power them up and keep them cool -our data centers save signi ficant amoun ts of ener gy and water . 
Data center in 
Lulea, Sweden 
During cons truction, we aim to reduce our waste 
foot prin t and recyc le as muc h of our mat erials as 
possible. By working closely with our general 
contractor and supplier s in Clone e, Ireland, we 
promoted a zero-waste culture and recyc led 96 
percent of the waste gener ated for the first three 
yea rs of cons truction. This result help ed our Clonee 
data center win Irelan d's Green Cons truc tion Awa rd 
in Februar y 2019. We use the U.S. Green Building Council (USG BC) 
green buildin g rating syste m called Leader ship in 
Ener gy and Envir onmen tal Design (LEED ) to hold all 
of our data centers to a high sustainab ility 
standar d. In 2019, four of our data center buildings 
in the U.S. officially earned LEED Gold certification. 
Our seco nd building in Lu lea, Sweden is the first to 
achie ve LEED Platinum , the highest rating possi ble.

Within our data center operations , we are cons tantly explor ing ways to drive data center efficienc y and sustainability by maximizing use 
of our server equip men t to stay ahead of rising power deman ds while also reducing our impact. 
Circular thin king is an important compon ent with in 
this process, wher e we embed circula rity at every 
stage of our hardwa re's life cycle by buildin g 
repairability and recyc labili ty princi ples into the 
hardwar e design process. We are also rethink ing 
our approach to managing depr ecated hardwa re, 
including server, rack and power equipm ent. By 
usin g hardwa re that are easy to repair and 
disass emble, we are able to redeplo y and reuse 
various componen ts of our hardwa re and syste ms, 
giving them a second life.

2.0 -Annual Data Center Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) 
Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to measure how 
efficiently our data centers convert energy into compute power. 
To measure the operating efficiency of our data centers, we 
compare the total amount of power we source from our utility 
with the power used to run the hardware within the data center. 
The "ideal" PUE is 1.0, meaning that every electron entering the 
site is used to power the hardware inside the data center. The 
industry average PUE is 1.5, and we're proud that our facilities 
have averaged 1.11 or below for the last five years. We still 
continue to look for additional ways to get even closer to 1.0. 
----
Annual Data Center Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) •Industry Average
Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) is a water efficiency metric that 
1.5 compares the amount of water we use to the amount of energy 
that is used by our hardware. Since we started tracking and 
reporting on this metric in 2012, we have consistently kept our WUE 
stable -and extremely low. We are also proud that Facebook was 1.0 
the first to report this metric publicly and we are still one of the few 
companies to share it.

Helping Data Center Communities 
Whenever we build a new data center, we are driving jobs and economic and sustainability impact for local communities. In 2019, we 
published a report quantifying that impact. 
For example, our Lu lea Doto Center in Sweden supported 1,461 construction and operational jobs per year between 2015 and 2018, 
driving €520 million of labor income. In the some timefrome, our Odense Dato Center in Denmark supported 1,843 construction and 
operational jobs per year, ultimately driving €315 million of labor income. We also directly spent €599 million locally for Danish goods and 
services. 
We are also thinking about our sustainability impact in our data center communit ies through an annual community grant program that 
funds projects focused on addressing regional social and environmental challenges, such as wildlife conservation and reforestation. In 
2019, we also deployed over $500,000 in one-time grants supporting major regional sustainability projects across the U.S , Europe and 
Asia. 
Driving Industry Standards 
Beyond our efforts to build and operate sustainable data centers, we strive to help shape the industry's standard for high performing data 
centers by partnering with thought leaders and organizations that share our vision. We are a member of the USG BC and we volunteer on 
technical committees to ensure LEED maintains a high bar for sustainability performance, doing our part to shape the future of its green 
rating system for 
data centers. 
It is this collaborative mindset that also led us to co-found the Open Compute Project in 2011. This organization encourages leading 
technology innovators to share their products and designs around data center infrastructure with an open source community, inspiring 
more transparency and pioneering development across the technology industry. The work of our Open Compute Project engineers and 
developers has played a crucial role in shaping how Facebook designs and builds some of the world's most efficient data centers.

our global facilities. We also work with suppliers that share our commitm -ent to sustainability. Beyqnd e::onstrL.J ction, we operate with high 
performance standards, optimize operational efficiency and reduce unnecessary waste to landfill. 
We use demanding industry standards to realize key opportu nities to make our operations more sustainable by optimizing our water 
and energy CQnsum ption For example, we adopted the International Organization for Standardization for Energy Management (ISO) 
50001 model and in 2019, we certified all of our UK and Irish offices Through data gathering and benchmarking to determine our energy 
use baseline, we implemented effective energy management solutions that reduced our electricity and natural gas consumption at 
these facilities. Our facilities are recertified each year to ensure that they continue to operate efficiently. 
Waste reduction is another example of our commitment to refining our operations and reducing our carbon footprint. Our Menlo Park 
headqu arters diverts over 90 percent of our waste away from landfills through extensive recycling and composting efforts. We are 
partnering with recycling and composting organizations to reduce further. Additional reduction efforts are sought through our entire 
culinary program. Not only are our teams reducing waste by optimizing how food is procured and cooked, but our teams are also 
seeking healthy alternatives to carbon-intensive meat-heavy dishes. As of 2020, every cafe was offering a minimum of 50 percent of its 
entrees as a vegetarian or vegan option 
As we continue to expand our operations around 
the world, data insights and setting benchmarks will 
play a crucial role in our ability to scale efforts to 
create more sustainable workplaces and minimize 
our impact. In 2019, we establis hed an operational 
goal to reduce the carbon footprint associated with 
global offices while meeting our goal to cultivate 
workplace productivity around the world. We 
focused our efforts on building a comprehensive, 
global approach to sustainable workplaces, 
expanding upon discrete initiatives to create a 
global program that helps us better understand the 
impacts and benefits of energy efficiency programs, 
projects and updates to buildings around the world. 
We created a global database to capture our water 
and energy consumption, as well as the amount of 
waste generated by our offices. This data-driven 
approac h helped us set a baseline of operating 
standards, create tools for standard and efficient 
operations and increase the visibility of the 
sustainable operations of our global portfolio. 
Community Impact Every week nearly 
30,000 meals are delivered to local 
char ities from our Menlo 
Park headquar ters to avoid 
undue food waste. 
In communities where our campus es are located, we aim to reduce our footprint while protecting neighboring habitats by incorporating 
sustainable building and landscape design. In 2015, we completed construction on a nine-acre green roof in our Menlo Park 
headqu arters, featuring more than 200 hundred trees and a half-mile pathway. The area has become a vital habitat for more than 
4,000 resident and migrant birds 
Our Culinary teams in our Menlo Park headquarters avoid undue waste by delivering nearly 30,000 meals per week to local charities 
and we also collaborate with local farmers' trucks to offer communities low-cost farm shares.

Driving Change Through Employee Engagement 
When it comes to sustainability in the workplace, our employees are some of our greatest supporters. Their engagement and interest 
help support Facebook's ability to create and maintain sustainable working environments. 
Throughout the year, we find opportunities to 
partner with employees on sustainability initiatives 
through internal engagement campaigns. For Earth 
Week in April 2019, we celebrated the moment by 
launching 40 employee events in more than 35 
global locations. These events included a series of 
sustainability activations, such as local community 
cleanups, AR/VR demos, SDG fireside chats, expert 
panels, and smart building tours More than 2,200 
employees participated to learn more about 
Facebook's sustainability commitments in company 
operations and how to integrate sustainability 
practices into their personal lives. During Climate 
Week in September 2019, six global offices hosted 
events to educate employees about climate change 
and how to get involved. Foodie Fair during Earth Week 2019 
Across the company, we continue to see employee enthusiasm and involvement in our sustainability program increase dramatically In 
2019, we had 13 internal Green@ chapters, which grew 40 percent from the prior year and included more than 2,400 employees across 
the world. These employee resource groups are key partners to advancing sustainability initiatives at Facebook. 
Foodie Fair during Earth Week 2019 
SDG fireside chat with Edward Palmieri and Mar cy 
Scott Lynn during Earth Week 2019 From taking alternative transportation to 
participating in internal sustainability events, 
engagement from employees has allowed us to scale 
our impact in reducing our environmental footprint. In 
an effort to curb their own environmental footprint, 
40 percent of employees across our global offices -
and 50 percent at our Menlo Park headquarters -
took alternative commute options to work in 2019. In 
2019, we successfully reduced the use of single-use 
plastic water bottles across global workplaces. By 
working together with the employee-led Green@ 
teams, this initiative led to a 50 percent reduction of 
single-use water bottles, or nearly 6 million bottles 
annually worldwide.
