A message  
from our CEO
At AbbVie, we are guided in everything we do by our desire to make a remarkable 
impact on the lives of patients. We strive to do this by discovering and developing 
a consistent stream of innovative medicines that make a real difference for people 
facing serious health problems. 
We have convened a world-class research organization and a diverse, talented and 
engaged workforce. Together they have developed important medicines that are 
benefitting patients with autoimmune conditions, cancer, hepatitis C, Parkinson’s 
disease, endometriosis and other complex diseases. 
As we look forward, we want to continue to be a long-term partner in the pursuit 
of better health outcomes. We know that doing so means thinking broadly about 
how we can use our expertise to advance health and wellness. It means building 
and maintaining the trust of all who rely on us, protecting our environment and 
understanding how we can be helpful members of the local and global community. 
Our company, our employees and our partners have done much in 2018 to 
advance those priorities. I am proud of our scientific advancements, public health 
engagement, commitment to diversity and talent development and the historic 
contribution of $350 million to U.S. nonprofit organizations supporting long-term 
community strength. 
It is my pleasure to introduce the AbbVie 2018 Responsible Action Report. It reflects 
ways in which we’ve worked to positively impact the lives of our patients, employees, 
partners and communities around the world.  
Sincerely,
Rick Gonzalez 
Chairman & CEO

The purpose of this report is to describe our approach to corporate 
responsibility and our recent activities to advance our responsibility priorities.We are a global, research-based biopharmaceutical 
company with more than 30,000 employees in more than 70 
countries. Since we became an independent company in 2013, 
we've grown and developed a culture and a purpose that is 
uniquely ours.
We focus on discovering, developing and delivering medicines 
that make a real impact, in therapeutic areas where we have 
proven expertise. These areas include immunology, oncology, 
virology and neuroscience. 
We maintain state-of-the-art research, development and 
manufacturing centers in some of the most productive 
innovation hubs across the globe. In addition to our North 
Chicago, Illinois (U.S.) headquarters, these include the Boston, 
Massachusetts area, the San Francisco, California area and 
centers in Germany, Italy, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Singapore 
and Japan.  
We are a passionate, diverse and inclusive organization 
that supports the best ideas, wherever they originate. Our 
scientists around the world are shaping their fields and 
inspiring all of us to do all we can to bring medicines to 
patients quickly and safely. Research investment
We invested $5.1 billion in research and development in 2018, nearly doubling our level of 
investment since our inception in 2013.  
Pro-bono research
AbbVie researchers donated nearly 40,000 hours of paid work time to conduct research on 
neglected tropical diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. We completed a Phase 1 clinical study of a 
potential treatment for river blindness through collaboration with multiple public health partners.
Access to medicine
We signed our third agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), granting MPP royalty-free 
license to the intellectual property for our first-line, pan-genotypic medicine for hepatitis C. The 
license will enable WHO-qualified generic manufacturers to produce lower-cost versions of the 
medicine for more than 90 low- and middle-income countries and territories.
Employee engagement
AbbVie employees around the world volunteered more than 93,000 hours in their communities, 
and our employee engagement rate reached 84 percent globally. 
Philanthropy
We contributed an additional $350 million to U .S. nonprofits helping families thrive, supporting 
disaster relief in Puerto Rico and strengthening K-12 education.

where we do business, and help

community vitality.Materiality
Our responsibility priorities should reflect the most material 
drivers of our success and the issues that are most 
important to our stakeholders.
To assess those priorities, we began with a comprehensive 
multi-stakeholder materiality assessment conducted in 
2016. The assessment identified the following topics 
as both highly material to AbbVie and very important to 
stakeholders:
• Product innovation and R&D productivity
• Drug pricing, reimbursement, intellectual property and 
biosimilar landscape
• Product quality and security
• Transparency, ethics and compliance
• Health and well-being at all ages
• Environmental stewardship
Since we conducted the materiality assessment, we have 
continued to engage broadly and frequently with both 
internal and external stakeholders to identify emerging 
issues and to keep our priorities aligned. We routinely 
engage with investors, policymakers, regulators, patient 
organizations, medical and scientific associations and 
nonprofit organizations in addition to our employees 
and partners. 
We also benchmark our efforts relative to external 
frameworks such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, 
CDP, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB). Over time, through this process, the following topics 
have risen in importance to join those already identified:
• Equality, diversity and inclusion
• Talent attraction, retention and development
• Community engagementOur corporate 
responsibility 
approach
Our corporate responsibility approach stems from our company 
principles, our long-term goals and our business strategy. 
Our Principles articulate what we believe to be right and true. 
They are foundational to our culture and guide our priorities, 
decisions and behavior. They are:
• Driving innovation
• Transforming lives
• Embracing diversity and inclusion
• Acting with integrity
• Serving the community 
It is with these principles in mind that we pursue our goals and 
business strategy:
At AbbVie, we strive to make a remarkable impact on 
patients and drive sustainable growth by discovering and 
delivering a consistent stream of innovative medicines 
that address serious health problems.
These are long-term ambitions, supported by many day-to-day 
actions. We consider it our responsibility to ensure that the things 
we do each day align with our principles and support our goals, 
being thoughtful about how our business decisions affect the 
many stakeholders we impact.

They are at the heart of our principle of transforming lives.   
Science and innovation are the cornerstones of our 
business. We focus on discovering, developing and 
delivering medicines for challenging diseases where we 
have expertise and can make a real impact for patients.
To do this, we must ensure that we deliver medicines 
reliably, with quality and safety patients can trust. We must 
act with integrity to maintain that trust.
We also understand that making a remarkable impact for 
patients takes more than medicine. That’s why we provide 
broader patient and family support, contribute research 
and funding to public health initiatives and support 
independent medical education.  
Our contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals
The United Nations developed the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a blueprint for achieving the vision of a better and 
more sustainable future for all. Underpinning the agenda are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), each with multiple sub-
targets. At AbbVie, we want to contribute to the achievement of the Agenda by advancing the goals and sub-targets that align most 
closely with our capabilities and responsibility commitments. We’ve identified six SDGs and, within them, key sub-targets, as our 
primary focus. Our activities may also advance other goals, and we continuously evaluate opportunities to expand our contributions.

Making a remarkable impact 
for patients

challenging diseases where we have 
expertise and can make a real impact 
for patients.10 2018 Responsible Action Report  2018 Responsible Action Report 11
We invest in research to make innovative medicines 
that offer real patient benefitOur progress
Our investment in research and development continues to 
grow, with increasing focus on these areas of very high need 
and potential impact: immunology, oncology and neuroscience. 
Since our inception in 2013, we have nearly doubled our level of 
investment, reaching $5.1 billion in 2018. From 2013-2018 we 
have also made over $1.5 billion in corresponding investment in 
our manufacturing network to develop the capabilities we need to 
make new innovative medicines. 
We are continuing to build and expand state-of-the-art 
research hubs in world-class research communities, 
providing an environment for innovation and collaboration 
for our scientists and with our research partners. In 2018 we 
expanded our Cambridge Research Center in the Cambridge, 
Massachusetts biotechnology corridor, so that researchers 
specializing in neuroscience and immunology can work together 
and with partners in academia and industry. We also announced 
plans to build a new oncology research center in South San 
Francisco, California, which will bring multiple distinct sites 
together as an oncology innovation hub.
In 2018, we continued to broaden our research portfolio. 
Our early-discovery portfolio includes more than 90 targets and 
we received 60 first-in-family patents this year. We established 
significant new research partnerships with biotechnology 
companies and major medical and academic institutions 
that are aligned with our key focus areas in R&D, including 
immunology, oncology and neuroscience. AbbVie Ventures, our 
strategic venture capital arm, also invested in six new early-stage 
companies conducting leading-edge science. Our goal is to find 
those technologies that will transform care and help move them 
forward more quickly.
Additionally, we renewed our research collaboration with 
Calico, the Alphabet-backed life sciences company focused on aging research and therapeutics. Since 2014, the collaboration 
between AbbVie and Calico has evaluated dozens of early-stage 
programs and yielded new insights into the biology of aging.
We advanced novel compounds through the pipeline and 
to patients. We continue to expand the number of programs 
in late-stage development. Many of our late-stage candidates 
have been granted regulatory designations to expedite 
development or review, with recognition of their potential to 
address pressing needs. Five additional programs received 
such designations in 2018.
We have had success bringing new treatments to patients. In 
2018, we received regulatory approvals for nine new products, 
indications or indication extensions that will advance the 
standards of care in endometriosis, blood cancers, hepatitis C 
and immune conditions. Indications received in the past five 
years comprise a growing proportion of our overall sales. 
Investing in novel solutions also requires us to be 
courageous in the face of tough decisions and to learn 
from setbacks that are inevitable in the scientific process.  
At the discovery phase, careful analysis of historical projects 
has allowed us to refine our candidate selection criteria. By 
doing so, in four years we have nearly halved the percentage of 
AbbVie-discovered small molecules terminated in late discovery 
due to toxicity. 
In 2018 we also received results from the clinical program for our 
antibody-drug conjugate targeting cancer stem-cell associated 
DLL-3 in small cell lung cancer, one of the hardest-to-treat 
forms of cancer. While the results were not what we hoped for, 
we are not deterred in our efforts to address some of the most 
challenging and debilitating diseases. 
This year, we pioneered new ways to measure the impact 
of treatment on the outcomes that matter most to patients. 
For example, some of the most important symptoms (itching, 
pain) and impacts (sleep disturbance) of atopic dermatitis cannot 
be easily observed by a clinician. We sought to learn about how 
treatment impacts these factors directly from patients. Our health 
outcomes researchers worked with dermatologists and patients 
to develop and validate two new tools to help measure these 
effects in clinical trials of potential new medicines.1 
In another study, we sought to better understand the physical 
and mental burden on patients with glioblastoma multiforme. 
In one part of our study, we used Fitbit® devices to assess how 
the disease affects patients’ activities of daily living, without 
interfering with individuals’ normal routines. Based on this 
research, we will go on to assess whether our treatment 
addresses the daily effects of the disease.
We know that the true value of 
a medicine is in the difference it 
makes in a patient’s everyday life. Investing to build new understanding and find genuinely 
novel solutions is critical to our mission and is one of our core 
commitments. Our vision is to help create transformative change, 
not just incremental improvement. For autoimmune disease, that 
means aiming for remission, not just symptom management. For 
cancer, it means finding ways for patients to achieve better and 
longer-lasting treatment results. For neuroscience, an area many 
across the industry have exited, we continue to pursue ways 
to slow, halt and ultimately reverse the damage of debilitating 
diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.
We know that the true value of a medicine is in the difference it 
makes in a patient’s everyday life. We are investing in new ways 
to bring a patient focus into the lab and the clinic as we develop 
innovative treatments. This includes ensuring that we address 
and measure the outcomes that really matter, and provide 
support beyond our medicine, to help patients achieve the best 
possible health outcomes. We recognize that in order to benefit from our medicines, 
patients must be able to access and afford them. Our approach 
to access is tailored on a product- and country-specific basis. We 
consider a range of factors including local disease burden, health 
and economic value of the medicine, ability to pay and budget 
impact and other factors impacting disease-specific outcomes, 
as well as the sustainability of different access strategies for the 
system and our business. 
Depending on the situation, we use a variety of approaches, 
including pricing and reimbursement models, patient financial 
assistance programs, intellectual property licensing, product 
donation and support for local capacity-building programs. 
Lastly, we understand that our research and medicines can 
make a real impact on public health and disease management. 
We conduct research to help improve screening, diagnosis and 
disease management in our therapeutic areas of focus.  Commitment: Use our expertise to improve health

Dermatitis Symptom Scale (ADerm-SS) and the Atopic Dermatitis impact Scale (ADerm-IS), Current Medical Research and Opinion.    
In 2018, AbbVie researchers made important contributions 
to disease management and public health. For example, 
endometriosis affects an estimated 1 in 10 women of 
reproductive age. Diagnosis is often delayed, placing a 
significant burden on patients and the health care system. 
We partnered with patients and health care providers to create 
and validate the Painful Periods Screening Tool to decrease the 
time to diagnosis for endometriosis. We also introduced the first 
FDA-approved oral treatment in over a decade for the treatment 
of moderate-to-severe pain associated with endometriosis.2Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for over 300,000 
hospitalizations of children under age five in industrialized 
countries each year. Premature infants are particularly vulnerable, 
and those who experience infection have lasting negative health 
effects and higher health care utilization than those who do not. 
Our team worked with health care providers and statisticians 
to identify the most significant risk factors for RSV infection in 
preterm infants. Their findings were published in 2018, and will 
help to educate parents about risk and help direct RSV preventive 
therapies cost-effectively to the most vulnerable infants.3
Our research teams are also participating in collaborative 
initiatives to advance patient care.
Health outcomes research collaborations advancing patient care
Some real world questions about the patient experience, such as optimal sequencing of newer 
treatments, cannot be answered through a regular clinical trial. AbbVie has partnered with 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital and 25 other investigators from leading institutions around the 
world on the CLL Collaborative Study of Real World Evidence (CORE). The goal of CORE is to collect 
detailed, real world longitudinal information about the experiences of CLL patients undergoing 
treatment, to help clinicians make more informed decisions in managing the disease.
AbbVie is a partner in the HARMONY Alliance, a public-private network designed to gather and 
analyze big data to uncover opportunities to speed the development of new treatments and more 
effective treatment strategies for patients with blood cancers.
In March 2018, AbbVie and the International Myeloma Foundation announced a collaboration to 
conduct a landmark retrospective study to understand the role of a specific genetic mutation on 
clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma.

Program provided free medication 
to nearly 81,000 patients in the U.S.Because we know that achieving health impact takes 
more than medicine, we continue to provide broad patient 
support, to enable the best possible health outcomes. In the 
U.S., our support programs help patients more fully understand 
their disease and the treatment they have been prescribed. They 
offer one-to-one education and support through personalized 
interactions, help patients adjust to the use of their medicine, and 
in some programs, also provide lifestyle management support to 
further promote health.
Outside the U.S., our AbbVie Care program includes a wide 
range of disease- and country-specific patient programs that 
provide meaningful, informative and empowering support to 
patients who have been prescribed AbbVie medicines. These 
programs are tailored to the needs and regulations in each 
country and patient community.
Globally, our patient support programs had over 2.3 million 
patient contacts in 2018.
AbbVie personnel do not give medical advice and are trained to 
direct patients to their health care professional for any treatment-
related questions.  
In the U.S., we continue to provide eligible patients 
with AbbVie medication at no cost through our Patient 
Assistance Program. The program allows people who are 
struggling to pay for medicines to access 15 of our medications 
at no cost. In 2018, we expanded the eligibility criteria for our 
Patient Assistance Program for our most-requested medicine, so 
we could help more individuals receive the support they need. 
Information about our access strategies for resource-limited 
settings can be found on pages 28-29.Partnering to eliminate hepatitis C 
Globally, an estimated 71 million people have chronic 
hepatitis C infection. The introduction of highly efficacious 
pan-genotypic therapies for hepatitis C virus (HCV) has made 
elimination of the disease an attainable goal. The World Health 
Organization has set a target to achieve elimination by 2030. 
Our epidemiology team worked with external experts to 
assess progress toward elimination in 45 countries, identifying 
areas where urgent action is needed to reach the target. The 
analysis is helping to build support for national elimination 
strategies and for initiatives where they are needed most.    
Eliminating a communicable disease means finding those 
harder-to-reach patients and linking them to diagnosis and 
care. We’ve implemented HCV awareness campaigns in 70 
countries around the world to educate the public about the 
importance of screening and treatment. Further, the global 
hepatitis community has endorsed a strategy called micro-
elimination—the targeted elimination of hepatitis in specific 
cities, regions or patient groups, including people who inject 
drugs. AbbVie is joining the community to support micro-elimination projects. In 2018, we launched 20 HCV micro-
elimination projects in 17 countries. We also supported over 
300 partner micro-elimination projects around the world, 
with the goal of scaling those that succeed and learning from 
those that do not. Finally, we launched MappingHepC.com, a 
new interactive online resource that features U.S. national and 
state-level data on HCV screening, diagnosis and treatment 
from two large studies.
HCV elimination also requires access to medicine. The 
Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) promotes access to medicines in 
low- and middle-income countries by granting qualified generic 
manufacturers royalty-free intellectual property licenses to 
make lower-cost versions of important medicines. In 2018, we 
announced our third licensing agreement with MPP, this one 
for our pan-genotypic, first-line treatment for HCV. The license 
will enable access in over 90 low- and middle-income countries 
and territories. AbbVie also has two licensing agreements with 
MPP for one of our treatments for HIV.

Our progress
Our commitment to ethics and integrity remained a focus 
of sustained efforts. In 2018, we refreshed our global Ethics & 
Compliance Helpline awareness campaign to remind employees 
about the importance of speaking up if they become aware of a 
potential violation of our principles, policies, procedures or the 
law. Our Ethics & Compliance Helpline is available 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week.     
In addition to the Code of Conduct employees in relevant 
functions received mandatory training on topics such as anti-
corruption and anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, recognizing 
and reporting safety information, appropriate product 
promotion, and appropriate interactions with health care 
providers and patient groups. 
In recognition of our transparency regarding political activities 
and donations, in 2018 we were named to the Center for Political Accountability’s list of “trendsetters”—the highest scoring tier—
in their annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure 
and Accountability.
Our research teams advanced the 3Rs mission (reduce, 
replace, refine) for ethical treatment of animals. Through our 
3Rs Advancement Award Program, scientists who adopt and 
implement the 3Rs concept are recognized. In 2018, seven teams 
were recognized for their efforts, with notable accomplishments 
including significant reduction in the number of animals required 
through use of advanced technologies and in vitro platforms. We 
also enhanced our animal care program by creating an outdoor 
space for exercise, socialization, enrichment and pre-adoption 
acclimation of canine participants.

Ethics
In order to make a positive long-term impact for patients we 
must earn and maintain their trust by acting with integrity in 
everything we do. Through our Code of Business Conduct , we 
set clear expectations for appropriate behavior. We support our 
employees in upholding these expectations through additional 
policies and procedures, a robust training program, and a well-
publicized disclosure program. We have systems in place to 
monitor, assess and correct behaviors if needed. 
We strive to be transparent in our interactions with external 
stakeholders. We disclose our payments to health care providers 
in accordance with the United States Sunshine Act, the European 
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations 
(EFPIA) Code on Disclosure of Transfers of Value from 
Pharmaceutical Companies to Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) 
and Healthcare Organizations (HCOs), and other similar codes. 
Research is foundational to our work. To have a lasting positive 
impact, we must conduct our research ethically. This begins in 
the lab and extends to the clinic. While animal testing is required 
by law for the development of new medicines, we consistently 
apply the internationally accepted “3Rs” principles, which means 
that we seek to reduce the number of animals needed to achieve 
research objectives when possible; replace animal studies 
with non-animal or sentient alternatives; and if animals must be 
studied, refine our practices to minimize any potential for pain 
and/or distress. Our Commitment to Humane Care and Use of 
Animals  further outlines our approach.   
Safety
Every year, tens of thousands of patients worldwide participate 
in clinical trials of potential AbbVie medicines. It’s because of 
these clinical trial participants that we can eventually bring 
medicines to many more patients. Their safety is our first priority. 
Our safety team of physicians and scientists are recognized 
experts both within and beyond the company, actively advancing 
the field in collaboration with academic scientists, health 
authorities, and industry peers. Our integrated, multi-disciplinary approach is designed to identify potential safety signals early 
and prevent avoidable problems. For marketed products, we use 
advanced post-marketing surveillance systems to detect and 
address signals quickly. We routinely achieve over 98 percent 
expedited reporting of adverse events to U.S. FDA and the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA).
Quality
We have robust systems in place to ensure the medicines we 
manufacture are high quality and available when patients need 
them. The Quality Council oversees our quality strategy and is 
accountable directly to our CEO. Highly skilled and experienced 
teams oversee every aspect of our manufacturing processes, from 
the suppliers who provide the inputs to the product delivered. 
We use an integrated enterprise quality management system 
that complies with applicable standards from the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Council for 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use (ICH) and regulatory authorities. We use both internal 
and external audits to ensure ongoing product quality. 
Though we produce many of the most critical components of 
our products in-house, we also purchase inputs from thousands 
of suppliers across the globe. From among these, we identify 
our most critical suppliers. This classification is based on many 
criteria, but the potential impact of a supplier issue on product 
efficacy, safety, availability or patient experience is paramount. For 
our most critical suppliers, we require strong controls and close 
involvement of AbbVie experts, including regular in-person and 
remote audits. Further, we continuously monitor the evolving legal 
and regulatory landscape to ensure that the chemicals, mixtures 
and commodities in our products, including purchased inputs, are 
compliant with applicable regulations. 
A secure supply chain helps to ensure not only product quality, 
but also a faster and more efficient process to reach customers 
and patients. To ensure the security of our materials as they move 
across borders, we participate in the Trusted Trader programs run 
by the U.S., E.U. and other customs authorities. Through these 
programs, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, E.U. customs 
authorities and other border authorities inspect and certify our 
security measures. More than 90 percent of our shipments of 
finished commercial products are received by locations in Trusted 
Trader programs. 
In addition, our global product protection team continuously 
scans our supply chain and the commercial landscape to prevent 
counterfeit or diverted products from reaching patients. Our 
measures include visible and invisible product features to verify 
authenticity; multiple and overlapping product tracking methods 
from origin to destination; and close partnership with local law 
enforcement authorities.  We maintain high standards of ethics,  
safety and quality
Our Code of Business Conduct applies 
to all employees globally and is 
available in 31 languages. Each year, 
all employees are required to complete 
interactive training on the Code and 
certify that they will adhere to it. Commitment: Steward our ethical and sustainable businessOur progress
Our commitment to ethics and integrity remained a focus 
of sustained efforts. In 2018, we refreshed our global Ethics & 
Compliance Helpline awareness campaign to remind employees 
about the importance of speaking up if they become aware of a 
potential violation of our principles, policies, procedures or the 
law. Our Ethics & Compliance Helpline is available 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week.     
In addition to the Code of Conduct employees in relevant 
functions received mandatory training on topics such as anti-
corruption and anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, recognizing 
and reporting safety information, appropriate product 
promotion, and appropriate interactions with health care 
providers and patient groups. 
In recognition of our transparency regarding political activities 
and donations, in 2018 we were named to the Center for Political Accountability’s list of “trendsetters”—the highest scoring tier—
in their annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure 
and Accountability.
Our research teams advanced the 3Rs mission (reduce, 
replace, refine) for ethical treatment of animals. Through our 
3Rs Advancement Award Program, scientists who adopt and 
implement the 3Rs concept are recognized. In 2018, seven teams 
were recognized for their efforts, with notable accomplishments 
including significant reduction in the number of animals required 
through use of advanced technologies and in vitro platforms. We 
also enhanced our animal care program by creating an outdoor 
space for exercise, socialization, enrichment and pre-adoption 
acclimation of canine participants.

Ethics
In order to make a positive long-term impact for patients we 
must earn and maintain their trust by acting with integrity in 
everything we do. Through our Code of Business Conduct , we 
set clear expectations for appropriate behavior. We support our 
employees in upholding these expectations through additional 
policies and procedures, a robust training program, and a well-
publicized disclosure program. We have systems in place to 
monitor, assess and correct behaviors if needed. 
We strive to be transparent in our interactions with external 
stakeholders. We disclose our payments to health care providers 
in accordance with the United States Sunshine Act, the European 
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations 
(EFPIA) Code on Disclosure of Transfers of Value from 
Pharmaceutical Companies to Healthcare Professionals (HCPs)

3 Lievano, F., et al. Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety. 2017: 26(8), 869-874.AbbVie safety scientists continued to advance both theory 
and practice in their field. They edited and made major 
contributions to the newly published textbook Pharmacovigilance: 
A Practical Approach  (Elsevier, 2018). Our teams are pioneering 
new pharmacovigilance models and techniques, publishing often 
in peer-reviewed journals. 
The safety and technology teams also 
collaborated to release the first robotic process 
automation in AbbVie’s Automation Center 
of Excellence. Named “Ditto,” this robot has 
now automated the cumbersome process of 
checking for duplicate adverse events. This 
process is ideal for automation because this 
manual task is both time consuming and prone 
to errors. Ditto has allowed us to increase 
efficiency and accuracy and deploy valuable human resources 
for more complex pharmacovigilance tasks. There are currently 
additional “bots” in development in the safety department.
Our safety team is also helping to train the next generation 
of pharmacovigilance professionals. We participate in post-
graduate safety science fellowships with academic medical 
centers, and teach pharmacovigilance in graduate training 
programs for health care providers. 
To ensure quality and regulatory compliance, AbbVie 
manufacturing sites received dozens of outside inspections 
and audits. Most of these are from major regulatory health 
authorities such as the U.S. FDA, the European Medicines 
Agency and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical 
Devices Agency. None of these audits had findings resulting in 
production stoppages.  
We conducted our own quality assessments and audits of 
our most critical suppliers to ensure they are upholding our 
quality standards. The frequency and method of supplier quality 
assessment is based on a detailed risk evaluation as specified 
in our supplier quality policies and procedures. In 2018 we 
conducted in-depth quality assessments of 474 supplier sites. 
Among those, we are particularly focused on those sites with the 
greatest potential to impact product efficacy and safety, aiming to 
assess each of these in-depth at least once every three years. In 
the three year period ending December 31, 2018, we conducted 
detailed assessments of more than 95 percent† of these sites at 
least once—some more frequently—with the majority of these 
assesments taking place in-person.We were able to maintain consistent supply to meet 
demand at nearly all times. Our assurance of supply program 
is designed to help us maintain supply even in unpredictable 
circumstances, such as natural disasters or surges in demand.  
We identify and qualify backup suppliers, scan the environment 
for potential risks and plan for alternate scenarios. For example, 
after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, a high 
level of preparedness allowed us to maintain production at all 
three of our local plants with no impact to patients.
Our goal is to have no backordered 
product, as backorders can cause 
treatment interruptions and impact 
patient outcomes. In 2018, backorders 
comprised fewer than 0.01 percent 
of the total orders we fulfilled.

Patients look to their families, caregivers and communities for 
support during their health journey. We want to help ensure they 
can receive broad care and support when it’s needed most.  
We support educational programs that equip patients with the 
knowledge and resources to understand their disease. These 
programs help connect patients with advocacy organizations, 
patient summits, online programs, and educational materials 
where they can learn more and meet other patients. 
We also recognize that a patient’s diagnosis impacts their 
caregivers. For example, we support the Davis Phinney 
Foundation, which empowers patients with Parkinson’s 
disease, and provides resources to their caregivers to be active 
participants in their care. We also fund organizations such as 
the Arthritis Foundation, the National Psoriasis Foundation, 
the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and the American 
Liver Foundation.
We support patients beyond their conditions. AbbVie offers 
scholarships to help patients reach their educational goals. 
• AbbVie’s Cystic Fibrosis scholarships provide financial 
support to young adults with cystic fibrosis as they pursue undergraduate and graduate degrees in the United States. 
The program has awarded over $3.2 million in scholarships 
in its 25 year history.
• Additionally, the Immunology Scholarships aim to 
empower exceptional students living with inflammatory 
disease in our United States. We share the stories of our 
scholarship recipients as an inspiration to others living 
with inflammatory diseases.  
Science and medicine are constantly changing. Patients trust 
that their health care providers are equipped with the latest 
information and resources to make the best choices for their 
treatment and help them navigate through it. We provide support 
for independent scientific and medical education programs that 
offer unbiased continuing education for experienced health care 
providers and scientists on current, new and emerging science. 
We also provide support for fellowships that allow health care 
providers who are new to their field to continue their training 
and increase their experience and knowledge in their specialty 
of interest. This financial support helps the next generation of 
providers who are entering fields where there is need.We advance patient, family and caregiver

Our progress
In 2018, our support for independent medical and patient 
education continued. 2018 highlights include: A pilot HCV 
educational program developed with our support proved 
successful in advancing the goal of HCV elimination, and was 
replicated globally.  A research initiative we funded used big data 
to identify new insights on education related to a chronic skin 
disease. This research resulted in 16 peer-reviewed publications. 
A “shared decision making” initiative receiving our support engaged health care providers and patients with the goal of 
improved patient-reported outcomes in endometriosis.
AbbVie was proud to make significant charitable gifts to 
help families thrive by providing family-centered care. We 
provided financial support to nonprofit partners addressing 
challenges that directly affect a family’s emotional, psychological 
and financial well-being during a child’s illness.

House Charities’ history. 
Family Reach: Because we believe that a child’s chances of overcoming cancer should never 
be jeopardized by financial barriers, we have contributed $5 million to Family Reach, to help 
alleviate the financial burdens associated with cancer. With this gift, Family Reach will expand and 
accelerate its programs and reach 25 new hospitals in 23 states in the United States.
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital: AbbVie has contributed $50 million to St. Jude to build 
new, family-centered areas on its Memphis, Tennessee campus. The spaces are designed to 
give kids and families a treatment-free place to recuperate and connect. This gift was the largest 
one-time gift in St. Jude’s history.
Direct Relief: Outside the United States, we also partner with nonprofits that support families of 
sick children. The AbbVie Foundation has partnered with Direct Relief and local organizations in 
Mexico to address major barriers to pediatric cancer care in regions with limited infrastructure. Our 
support helped develop a program focused on providing transportation, lodging and meals.

When the Garinis family learned that their 6-year-old son Constantine had a brain tumor, 
they left their home in Long Island, New York for the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, so 
that Constantine could receive the best treatment. The Garinis family anticipated having 
to rely on their savings to pay for a hotel, but then learned of a nearby Ronald McDonald 
House, a place that offered lodging and services for families with children receiving 
treatment for serious illnesses, and soon had a place to stay.
This particular House serves over 1,300 families like the Garinises per year, and the need 
is growing. For every family staying at the House, four others must be turned away due to 
lack of space, resulting in thousands of families with sick children—in the Philadelphia 
area alone—being put on waitlists every year. However, because of AbbVie’s $100 million 
donation, soon more families will have access to the family-centered support provided at this 
House and others around the United States through the Ronald McDonald House Charities.18 2018 Responsible Action Report  2018 Responsible Action Report 19

House, a place that offered lodging and services for families with children receiving 
treatment for serious illnesses, and soon had a place to stay.
This particular House serves over 1,300 families like the Garinises per year, and the need 
is growing. For every family staying at the House, four others must be turned away due to 
lack of space, resulting in thousands of families with sick children—in the Philadelphia 
area alone—being put on waitlists every year. However, because of AbbVie’s $100 million 
donation, soon more families will have access to the family-centered support provided at this 
House and others around the United States through the Ronald McDonald House Charities. “Developing and bringing innovative, life-saving 
medicines to patients requires diverse thought 
and approaches. Bringing together experts from 
diverse backgrounds and thought is crucial to 
our ability to deliver today and into the future.”
– Rick Gonzalez, Chairman and CEO Building and supporting a diverse, 
high-performing workforce
For an innovation-driven company like AbbVie, the 
knowledge, ideas and capabilities that employees 
bring are critical. We’re focused on attracting, retaining, 
developing and supporting the people who, working 
together, can advance our mission.  
Embracing diversity and inclusion is fundamental at 
AbbVie. We know that the best ideas can come from 
anywhere in the organization, so employees must be 
comfortable sharing their perspectives and challenging 
each other. 
To maximize the performance of individuals and teams, 
we must help them build the capabilities that are most 
critical to our mission and success. We must also treat 
them with respect, provide a safe environment and 
support their well-being. In this section: 
We promote a diverse, inclusive workplace 
and invest in capability development to 
drive innovation
We protect human rights and workplace safety
We offer our people the resources and support 
they need to be at their personal best every dayEvidence shows that equality, diversity and inclusion in the 
workplace help to drive superior business performance. We know 
we are at our best when all voices are heard and valued and 
when our employees can contribute their best. To fully realize 
this, we have committed to embracing diversity and inclusion as 
one of our guiding Principles. 
Our Chairman and CEO and executive leadership team oversee 
and take accountability for our equality, diversity and inclusion 
strategy, actions, measurements and results. 
Activating this strategy helps us innovate, understand our 
customers and attract and retain the best talent. We proactively 
engage talent from diverse backgrounds. Our state-of-the-art 
research, development and manufacturing centers in some of 
the most productive innovation hubs across the globe put us 
at the heart of cutting-edge research and enable us to attract 
top science talent. In our affiliates around the world, a range 
of programs ensure we attract and hire a diverse workforce, 
including women, people from all backgrounds and ethnicities 
and people with disabilities. 
To support our diverse workforce, we must create an environment 
where all individuals can thrive. This means providing inclusive 
benefits, such as inclusive parental leave and adoption 
assistance, health care benefits for same-gender partners and 
military leave.1 It also means educating and engaging employees 
about inclusion. Our functional Equality, Diversity and Inclusion 
Councils and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)2 enrich our 
workplace by promoting awareness and appreciation of our 
diversity, and supporting people of all backgrounds to develop 
and thrive in the organization.
Attracting a high-performing workforce is only the first step. 
Our approach to employee development is directly linked to our 
business priorities. We identify enterprise critical capabilities— 
those capabilities that have a direct and significant impact on our ability to deliver on our long-term business strategy. We 
focus significant development programming on those particular 
capabilities and the people who hold the roles where they reside. 
We then use ongoing analysis to inform and refine our employee 
development strategy, using employee surveys, performance 
evaluations and talent reviews to ensure that we are successfully 
recruiting, retaining and deploying top talent, while monitoring 
and fostering high engagement levels for all employees. 
This measurement-based approach accelerates differential 
investment in the right areas, growing a strong pipeline of talent 
for the future.
More broadly, we provide resources for the learning and 
development of all employees. Our signature global program, 
Learn.Develop.Perform,  is a weeklong series of live, interactive 
learning events designed to keep all employees deliberately 
focused on their development. In 2018, more than 16,000 
employees—over half of our global workforce—voluntarily 
participated in the program. 
In addition, functional organizations have dedicated learning and 
development teams that provide training on function-specific 
knowledge and skills.We promote a diverse, inclusive workplace and

Selected distinctions for equality, diversity and inclusionOur progress
While we are consistently recognized for our diversity 
and inclusion, in 2018 we redoubled our commitment. We 
created a new Vice President role focused exclusively on equality, 
diversity and inclusion. We also made a new commitment 
to gender equality, SDG 5, and published our statement of 
Commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion. It describes how 
we advance equality, diversity and inclusion in our workplace 
and hold ourselves accountable by creating function-specific 
strategies and measuring our progress against them. 
We launched new programs to help us attract and develop 
a diverse workforce. We are committed to advancing gender 
equality at all levels. To help advance talented women into 
top management roles, we launched  Women’s Leadership 
Journey . This global leadership development program includes 
programming that extends over five months, to ensure learning 
is sustained and applied to real work challenges. Participants 
enjoy opportunities to meet and talk with senior executive women 
leaders from across the enterprise. 
Women’s Leadership Journey  complements the existing 
global  Executive Diversity Mentoring Program , which aligns 
high-performing diverse and female talent with senior 
executive leaders for a one-year partnership. Mentors provide 
guidance and counsel to ensure mentees are on the path for 
continued development.
We also enhanced our engagement with the U.S. veteran 
community to attract and hire veterans. In 2018, our headquarters 
hosted the Honor Foundation for Special Forces to offer 
exposure to career opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry. 
We continued our partnership with the Great Lakes Naval Base, 
located near our headquarters, on their transition classes.
Additionally, our Veterans ERG worked alongside Human 
Resources and the sales organization on a focused veteran 
recruitment initiative with great success. The Lifetime television 
network profiled AbbVie on their show, Military Makeover . 
To further advance inclusion, we launched a new Inclusive Culture 
Learning Series. Available in 12 languages, five learning modules 
cover topics such as unconscious bias, including and making 
everyone feel valued and the ways diversity and inclusion impact 
our business.
We enhanced our support for employee networking as 
a way to connect individuals, foster informal mentoring 
and broaden visibility to the talent in our workforce. Our 
company is large and diverse, which means that when we have a need, we often have people with applicable experience 
and skills within the organization. However, identifying those 
people can be challenging. Similarly, we realized that there 
were talented people in the organization whose advancement 
was limited not by performance but by visibility. That’s why we 
launched Talent Link, an online internal professional networking 
platform. Talent Link enables employees to find internal experts 
or colleagues with particular experience, skills or interests. It 
helps employees to connect with each other, build communities 
of interest and find mentors.
Our employee engagement rate continued to rise. Employee 
engagement is a composite metric reflecting employee 
sentiment about the company, their workplace and their work.  
We view it as an indication of the willingness of our employees 
to give ‘discretionary effort’ to the company. The 2018 employee 
survey again reflected an increase in employee engagement rate 
to 84%, markedly outperforming the Best Companies benchmark 
rate of 70%, which we aim to consistently exceed.

We believe in the inherent dignity of every human being and 
respect individual rights as set out in the Universal Declaration  
of Human Rights. We know that our responsibility as an employer 
and as a responsible corporate citizen is to prevent, mitigate 
and remedy any adverse human rights impacts across our value 
chain. Our Commitment to Human Rights describes the ways in 
which we ensure respect for all people, including our employees, 
contractors, suppliers and patients.  
Workplace safety is one of the ways we live our commitment 
to human rights. We provide comprehensive workplace safety 
training for all employees, as appropriate for their environment. 
Our guiding philosophy is called Zero. Believe It. Achieve It, 
which reflects the core belief that every environmental, health

preventative mindset. 
We also obtain external certifications for workplace safety. 
Nine of our manufacturing sites are certified to the international 
standards for safety associated with OHSAS-18001 (five sites) or 
ISO 450001 (four sites). All OHSAS-18001 certified sites will move 
to ISO 45001 over the next two years, and three additional sites 
are in the process of obtaining ISO 45001certification, which is

Our progress
In 2018, we benchmarked our employee well-being efforts 
both internally and externally, confirming the strength of 
our programs. 
We received a Platinum distinction, the top honor available, 
from Best Employers for Healthy Lifestyles.  Awarded by the 
National Business Group on Health, this award recognizes the 
best workforce well-being programs in the U.S., particularly those 
with a holistic approach to well-being, encompassing financial, 
emotional, social and community aspects. It further recognizes 
a connection between employee well-being and key business 
outcomes.
Participation in our global wellness programs continued 
to grow. In 2018, nearly 7,900 employees in 62 countries

hours of exercise per employee over the course of the program. 
Participation in AbbVie World of Well-being  has grown more than 
30 percent since 2016, to over 6,000 employees.
We created the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund (AEAF) 
to support our employees around the world.  The AEAF 
funds programs that offer employees assistance at two pivotal 
moments: when a child goes to college and when disaster 
strikes. The goal of these programs is to offer resources to 
employees and their families when they need it most. 
AEAF became operational in early 2019 and supports two new 
programs for our global employees:
• AbbVie Possibilities Scholarship: Children of AbbVie 
employees may apply for an annual merit-based scholarship 
of up to $5,000 for use at accredited colleges, universities or 
vocational-technical schools.
• Employee Relief Program: AbbVie employees may apply for 
financial assistance when facing large-scale disasters (e.g. 
hurricane), individual disasters (e.g. home fire) or financial 
hardship (e.g. death of spouse). 
Both programs are managed by independent nonprofits, 
Scholarship America and E4E Relief. AbbVie is not involved 
in selecting recipients under either program, but general 
oversight of the programs will be provided by AbbVie’s Global 
Philanthropy team in close partnership with Human Resources. We recognize that a corporation with global scale and 
unique resources has the opportunity to use those 
resources for social good. 
Giving back is an integral part of who we are. That’s why 
we donate our expertise in drug discovery, development 
and safety science to help address certain diseases that 
primarily affect the underserved. It’s why we encourage 
our employees to be engaged with their communities and 
to volunteer during working hours. And it’s why we provide 
philanthropic support to build long-term community 
strength.
We also know that good health requires a healthy 
environment and that climate change will increasingly 
impact human health. We hold ourselves accountable 
for sustainably running our business and reducing our

Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), together with widespread 
diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, affect public health 
and the economic well-being of more than one billion people 
worldwide. They disproportionately affect low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs). Because of this impact, ending 
these diseases has become a key sub-target for United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensuring Good Health and 
Well-Being).
AbbVie was one of the original signatories to the London 
Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases in 2012. This 
global partnership among pharmaceutical companies, donors, 
endemic countries and nonprofit organizations aims to 
eliminate or control 10 NTDs. Our cross-functional Executive 
Council for Neglected Diseases oversees and coordinates 
our contributions to this important goal. Our efforts span 
multiple diseases including malaria, tuberculosis, buruli ulcer, 
onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, soil transmitted helminths, 
Chagas disease and dengue fever.
At the heart of our efforts is a pro-bono research program 
through which AbbVie researchers donate paid work time 
to research partnerships of global health nonprofits that are 
addressing these diseases. Participation has grown to more than 
400 researchers and our portfolio of projects continues to grow. 
We do this work with no expectation of commercial benefit.    
We also help to build health system capabilities where they are 
needed. We provide in kind support to the Bill & Melinda Gates 
Foundation’s global “Smart Safety Surveillance” initiative to 
enhance pharmacovigilance systems in low- and middle-income 
countries. AbbVie was also an early sponsor of a public-private 
partnership to develop a mobile application to enhance adverse 
event reporting for our patients in Africa. Tools like this offer great 
potential to enhance public health and safety worldwide.
AbbVie partners with global humanitarian organizations to 
donate our medicines to people in need. Through our product 
donation programs, we provide medicines for people who 
would have no other means of accessing them. 
We know that addressing the health needs of the underserved 
requires a community-level approach. AbbVie and the AbbVie 
Foundation support health system strengthening both close to 
home and further afield. In the North Chicago (U.S.) community 
where our global headquarters are located, we built a health clinic at the local high school and provided funding to establish 
foundational care. In 20 countries around the world, our Good 
to Grow program supports collaboration across stakeholders 
to address causes of preventable neonatal mortality for 
premature infants.
We have a long history in HIV that includes the development of 
important medicines that are now licensed royalty-free to the 
Medicines Patent Pool for lower-cost access in LMICs. The 
AbbVie Foundation works with leading partners to support 
community-based programs that address the needs of families 
living with HIV in resource-limited areas. 
In addition, the AbbVie Foundation has supported nonprofit 
organizations including Partners in Health, Direct Relief, 
University of Notre Dame’s Institute for Global Health, Global 
Health Corps, MAP International, Indiana Universities’ AMPATH 
Consortium and the Sabin Vaccine Institute, improving local 
capabilities to address health needs and build health care 
leadership capacity in Africa and Latin America. This work 
includes training community health workers, disease surveillance 
and mapping, supporting prevention, screening and early 
detection, and linkage to care.We give our medicines, expertise and funding to

Augustine Osuma—Giving expertise  
to drive public health outcomes
AbbVie’s neglected disease research 
program attracts talented AbbVie 
scientists who donate their time to 
researching treatments for neglected 
tropical diseases, malaria and 
tuberculosis.
AbbVie researchers are drawn to the 
program by a passion to use their 
scientific expertise to address public 
health. AbbVie scientist Augustine 
Osuma has contributed to the program 
for the past eight years. Having seen 
the effects of tropical diseases as a 
child in his hometown in Lagos, Nigeria, 
Augustine has been motivated to find 
a solution. Through the program, he 
has had the opportunity to research better treatments for 
diseases like tuberculosis that disproportionately affect 
communities in low- and middle-income countries.  Augustine Osuma 
has dedicated 
pro-bono hours to 
AbbVie’s neglected 
disease research 
program for nearly 
a decade.

Value of AbbVie medicine donated* (WAC) (millions) $31.6 $26.2 $92.3Our progress
2018 was a significant year in our work on neglected tropical 
diseases. Our researchers contributed nearly 40,000 hours 
(more than 20 full time equivalent employees) to these efforts. We 
were pleased to complete a Phase 1 clinical study of a potential 
treatment for river blindness, which has been granted Fast Track 
status by the FDA. The results of the study support progression 
to Phase 2.
Additionally, a team of AbbVie process chemists donated their 
expertise to a nonprofit partner working on a promising treatment 
for drug-resistant tuberculosis. They developed a new way to 
synthesize the drug that would be significantly more economical. 
The cost of one key ingredient was reduced by more than 
sevenfold, and the overall yield – the product obtained – was 
increased by more than four times. If the compound receives 
regulatory approval, it will be more affordable.  
We contributed to the World Intellectual Property 
Organization’s Patent Information Initiative for Medicines 
(Pat-INFORMED) database, which helps facilitate decisions 
and actions supporting access to medicines globally. The 
database enables health agencies and other decision-makers to 
simply access information on patent status of medicines for HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis C, oncology, 
respiratory conditions, and all products on the World Health 
Organization Essential Medicines List. To date, AbbVie has shared 
the patent information for several of our HIV and HCV treatments.
The community health programs we support continued 
to address needs of the underserved. For example, since 
2013 the AbbVie Foundation has supported the Baylor College 
of Medicine International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI) in 
providing comprehensive HIV care and treatment to children 
in Romania and Malawi. In 2018 these programs served over 
31,000 people. 
The AbbVie Foundation has also supported AMPATH’s HIV 
Perpetual Home-Based Counseling and Testing (PHCT) program 
in Kenya since the Foundation’s inception. Over the past five 
years the program has screened over 1.3 million people including 
many in remote areas with limited access to care.
With support from the AbbVie Foundation, BIPAI, AMPATH and 
other grant recipients help to build the capacity of local health 
workforces.  Since 2013, AbbVie Foundation-funded programs 
have educated or trained over 13,000 local health care workers.
Medicine donation partnerships
Twins Kaan and Kiara were born prematurely in Gjakova, 
western Kosovo. Kiara was born healthy, but Kaan was 
immediately diagnosed with infant respiratory distress 
syndrome (IRDS)  – the leading cause of death among 
preterm newborns. Kaan was rushed to the University 
Clinical Center of Kosovo (UCCK), the only facility in the 
country able to treat infants with IRDS. 
Through AbbVie’s product donation partnership with 
Americares, UCCK receives an AbbVie product for IRDS. 
Kaan’s doctors administered treatment and kept Kaan on 
respiratory support until he stabilized and could breathe 
on his own. His mother, Edona, was able to take her twins 
home a few weeks later. 
This program has saved the lives of thousands of Kosovar 
infants with IDRS, like Kaan. A similar partnership between 
AbbVie and Direct Relief has reached nearly 5,000 babies 
in 12 countries.
AbbVie also partners with Mercy Ships and Operation Smile 
to increase access to essential surgical care. Mercy Ships 
works in areas of sub-Saharan African nations like Togo, 
Benin, Madagascar, Cameroon and Guinea where access to life-changing surgeries can be limited. Over the past six years, 
our general anesthetic has been used in more than 7,000 
surgeries on the ship, known as the Africa Mercy.
Operation Smile provides free cleft lip and cleft palate 
surgeries for children and young adults in places of need 
and utilizes 36 years of surgical expertise to help strengthen 
local health systems. Since 2013, our medicine donations 
have helped serve more than 21,000 young people in nearly 
40 countries.

Since 201 3, we have donated medicines 
for use in over 100 countries.We believe in the importance of a healthy environment and 
sustainable use of natural resources. We work to advance the 
sustainability of our operations by reducing the energy and water 
we consume, and by reducing the waste we generate. We also 
monitor our operations to ensure that the manufacture, use and 
disposal of our products do not adversely affect the environment 
or human health.  We have set ambitious, long-term environmental sustainability 
targets for absolute reductions to carbon emissions, water use 
and waste generation while driving increases in renewable 
electricity. Through participation in CDP, we are transparent 
about our efforts and our impacts.
We also expect our suppliers to join us in our efforts to protect 
the environment. As stated in our Supplier Code of Conduct , 
we expect that “suppliers shall operate in an environmentally 
efficient manner and shall strive to minimize adverse impacts 
on the environment.” Our sustainability audits include a robust 
assessment of the environmental stewardship practices of 
key suppliers.
Through our sustainable procurement policy, we prioritize the 
selection of suppliers and purchased goods that have lower 
impact on the environment when compared with competing 
products that serve the same purpose.

manufacturing sites have ISO 14001 
certification for effective environmental 
management systems, nine have ISO 
50001 certification for effective energy 
management systems, and we are 
working toward three more ISO 50001 
certifications.Our progress
We have continued to make progress on our absolute 
environmental sustainability targets relative to our 2015 
baseline, even as our business has grown.
We’re working to reduce carbon emissions through 
investment in technology, infrastructure and processes 
that will be more energy efficient. For example, we purchase 
100 percent renewable electricity at our manufacturing sites 
in Europe and are exploring new opportunities to expand this 
achievement globally. We have also expanded the use of hybrid 
and electric vehicles in our global fleet. In Japan, 100 percent 
of fleet vehicles have been converted to hybrid. We are also 
investing in new metering and energy management software to 
help identify new energy savings opportunities.  
We’ve reduced water consumption at our North Chicago 
manufacturing site by over 400,000 m3 per year since 
2015. We’ve invested in water efficient technology to generate the high purity water we use in our manufacturing processes. 
We’ve also installed rainwater harvesting equipment at our 
Singapore manufacturing site. Our stated target of reducing 
overall water withdrawal has been harder to reach, in part 
because it includes use of non-contact cooling water, which 
has risen recently. Non-contact cooling water is returned to the 
source in the same amount and with the same quality as was 
withdrawn. The increase we’ve seen in our non-contact cooling 
water use is generally due to seasonal variations in source 
water temperatures. 
To reduce waste, we are continuing to focus on recycling 
and striving for zero waste to landfill. Our Campoverde, Italy 
manufacturing site achieved an 84 percent recycling rate in 
2018. This includes recycling of solvents that are used in the 
active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing process.

sustainable use of natural resources. We work to advance the 
sustainability of our operations by reducing the energy and water 
we consume, and by reducing the waste we generate. We also 
monitor our operations to ensure that the manufacture, use and 
disposal of our products do not adversely affect the environment 
or human health.  We have set ambitious, long-term environmental sustainability 
targets for absolute reductions to carbon emissions, water use 
and waste generation while driving increases in renewable 
electricity. Through participation in CDP, we are transparent 
about our efforts and our impacts.
We also expect our suppliers to join us in our efforts to protect 
the environment. As stated in our Supplier Code of Conduct , 
we expect that “suppliers shall operate in an environmentally 
efficient manner and shall strive to minimize adverse impacts 
on the environment.” Our sustainability audits include a robust 
assessment of the environmental stewardship practices of 
key suppliers.
Through our sustainable procurement policy, we prioritize the 
selection of suppliers and purchased goods that have lower 
impact on the environment when compared with competing 
products that serve the same purpose.

As a large global employer, AbbVie provides economic 
opportunity to communities around the world. Our diverse and 
committed employees contribute in many ways to the economic 
and cultural vitality of their communities.
We also create business opportunity for thousands of suppliers in 
more than 120 countries and all 50 U.S. states. In North America, 
our Supplier Diversity program is designed to integrate small and 
diverse businesses into our supply chain. We offer opportunities 
for historically underutilized populations, including minorities, 
women, military veterans and others, to do business with AbbVie.
Employee volunteerism
Community volunteerism is an integral part of AbbVie’s 
culture. About one quarter of AbbVie employees volunteer 
annually through programs sponsored by AbbVie or the AbbVie 
Foundation.  In recognition of this culture, FORTUNE  and 
Great Place to Work  ranked AbbVie #8 among their 50 Best 
Workplaces for Giving Back in 2018.
Beyond Week of Possibilities, our annual company-wide 
week of service, AbbVie employees engage with students in 
their communities through educational programs sponsored 
by the AbbVie Foundation. In North Chicago, the AbbVie 
STEM  (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) Challenge 
was developed in partnership with the Illinois Science and 
Technology Institute  to enable students from the high school to 
explore potential careers in science. Around the globe, AbbVie 
employees encourage science education as volunteers with the 
AbbVie Foundation’s SEEK (Science, Engineering, Exploration, 
Knowledge) program for kids. 
AbbVie employees contribute financially to their communities as 
well. Our North America employee giving and matching program 
encourages employees to make charitable donations to eligible 
nonprofit organizations. Through an online platform supported 
by AbbVie, employees, retirees and former and current members 
of the Board of Directors may make contributions—through 
payroll deduction if they choose—to charities of their choice. 
The AbbVie Foundation matches those contributions dollar for 
dollar, up to $5,000. In the fall of each year we run the Employee 
Giving Campaign, to encourage participation in the program. We 
aim to consistently exceed 85% participation in the campaign.
Philanthropy 
We donate directly to our communities. Since the company’s 
inception in 2013, AbbVie and the AbbVie Foundation have 
contributed significant funding directly into the North Chicago 
community immediately surrounding our global headquarters. Through the work of more than 30 local nonprofit organizations, 
our contributions have helped to build the district’s first 
preschool, renovate libraries, classrooms, athletic facilities 
and activity rooms and fund the adoption of new math and 
reading curricula. 
Natural disasters can cause injury, illness, death, homelessness 
and economic loss. We want to help communities recover from 
disasters and become more resilient for the future. Our disaster 
relief program has helped communities impacted by more than 
40 disasters in more than 25 countries.Commitment: Support long-term community strength

Workplaces for Giving Back in 2018.
We support communities through economic activity, 
employee volunteerism and philanthropyOur progress
In 2018, we purchased goods and services valued at more 
than $13 billion with suppliers around the world. This 
included nearly $900 million from approximately 2,000 
small and diverse businesses in North America, including 
Puerto Rico. We supported the development of small and 
diverse suppliers through our Annual Supplier Diversity and 
Development Conference, attended by over 100 incumbent and 
prospective suppliers. They heard from AbbVie senior leaders, 
participated in matchmaking sessions with our purchasing 
organization and attended workshops on topics such as brand 
strategy, growth and scaling and innovation with AbbVie and 
external faculty. These learning and development opportunities will benefit them both in and beyond their business with AbbVie. 
We also mentored suppliers through the Diversity Alliance for 
Science mentoring program. Our pro-bono environmental health 
and safety audit program offers small and diverse suppliers with 
free audits by our experienced teams.  
The AbbVie Foundation’s SEEK program continued to grow, 
adding new programs in Bulgaria, China, Colombia, Peru, 
Switzerland and Vietnam. In 2018, AbbVie employees around 
the world volunteered 1,250 hours to support the program, 
offering 1,860 students with hands-on insight into the scientific 
discovery process.
SEEK Junior Scientist, Illinois, January 2018
AbbVie is a champion of diverse suppliers and encourages 
all types of small-business owners—including people 
from disadvantaged and minority backgrounds, women, 
veterans and others—to work with us. Our partnerships 
with diverse companies build shared economic strength, 
enhancing businesses and surrounding communities. 
Overture, a promotional marketing business in Chicago, 
has been a member of AbbVie’s cohort of diverse suppliers 
since 2017. Overture is a small women-owned business 
certified by the Women’s Business Enterprise National 
Council. Over the past two years, Overture has supported 
several AbbVie events, including our company-wide week 
of service— Week of Possibilities— with everything from 
branded volunteer shirts to display materials.  
Overture’s CEO and Owner Jo Gilley believes that her 
partnership with AbbVie exemplifies what it means to have 
a collaborative, rather than a transactional, relationship. 
Working with AbbVie, Jo has been able to strengthen 
partnerships with diverse suppliers across Chicago and 
continues to grow her business. Jo especially values 
the opportunity to connect with other women-owned 
businesses and was inspired to launch OWL—Overture 
Women Leaders—to encourage younger, emerging 
women leaders at Overture and give them a platform to 
make connections and support and inspire each other to 
grow into leaders in business. The AbbVie Foundation’s SEEK (Science, Engineering, 
Exploration, Knowledge) program introduces students 
ages five to 14 to science and engineering through fun and 
participatory activities. SEEK uses a variety of exercises—
such as the Mystery Box—to give underserved students 
an opportunity to explore the excitement of science and 
AbbVie volunteers the chance to engage with young, 
bright minds. The program uses simple experiments to 
engage students, showing how these skills are important 
in science and other careers. AbbVie scientists and 
engineers not only lead the programs, but also played a 
role in the development of the process. 
In 2018, we introduced the SEEK Junior Scientist, a 
program targeted at students in pre-Kindergarten to first 
grade. The program allows young students to dress up as 
scientists with lab coats and safety glasses to investigate 
and learn about the color green. Junior Scientist supports 
young students to practice creative thinking and processes 
used by scientists, such as asking questions, observing, 
predicting and testing.Elevating small and diverse suppliers SEEK: Nurturing young scientists

AbbVie supports nonprofit organizations advancing education for the underservedIn its fifth year, our signature global volunteer event,  
Week of Possibilities, saw AbbVie participants in 
56 countries donate more than 37,000 hours of 
community service. Adding the community engagement 
throughout the remainder of the year, AbbVie employees gave 
more than 93,000 hours worldwide. In addition, over 12,000 
employees – over 87 percent of those eligible and triple the 
industry standard – participated in our North America employee 
giving and matching program, generating $11.8 million to 
benefit more than 6,000 charities.
We deepened our commitment to addressing the 
academic achievement gap for children and adolescents in 
underserved areas. In 2018, we donated a total of $95 million 
to four nonprofit partners working in our communities.
North Chicago Community Unit School District 187: AbbVie donated $40 million to fund the 
rebuilding of the district's only middle school: Neal Math & Science Academy. This donation will 
provide a safer, modernized learning environment to improve student success and aims to help 
improve graduation rates, reduce dropout rates and increase college and career readiness. The 
district will focus on supporting social/emotional learning and strong relationships between 
students and teachers, and increasing access to high-quality academic programs.
Communities In Schools (CIS): The nation's largest organization dedicated to empowering at-risk 
students, CIS works to ensure every student is offered an equitable opportunity to excel in the 
classroom and beyond. AbbVie's donation of $30 million will allow CIS to provide essential support 
services to nearly 100,000 underserved children, including children in 16 high-need Chicago public 
schools. This investment represents the largest single corporate donation Communities In Schools 
has received in its 40-year history.
The University of Chicago Education Lab: The Education Lab partners with Chicago Public 
Schools, local nonprofits and city government to identify and test innovative ways to improve 
outcomes for Chicago's most vulnerable youth. AbbVie's $15 million donation will expand the Lab's 
partnership with Chicago Public Schools, supporting work to implement promising services for 
Chicago's students, and evaluate and scale these solutions in similar settings around the country.

to natural disasters. In addition to supporting numerous 
disasters across the world, AbbVie provided support for 
innovative initiatives designed to increase health-related 
disaster preparedness. 
Further, as a committed employer in Puerto Rico, we are working 
with partners to support long-term efforts that will move the 
community from recovery to resilience in the wake of Hurricane 
Maria. With a $50 million gift from AbbVie, Habitat for Humanity 
will execute its five-year plan to strengthen housing in key areas on the island. Habitat expects to directly assist 13,000 
people through repairs, new construction, workforce training 
and assistance with clearing property titles. Through its work to 
effect policy and systems reforms, Habitat also expects to make 
significant progress in aiding many of the estimated 1.3 million 
Puerto Ricans who live in housing that was built without clear 
title or proper permits.
AbbVie also donated $50 million to Direct Relief to rebuild and 
strengthen the primary health care system.34 2018 Responsible Action Report  2018 Responsible Action Report 35 “AbbVie has demonstrated a long-
standing commitment to supporting 
and investing in North Chicago. 
This donation will help support 
our high expectations for student 
learning in the STEM areas of 
science, technology, engineering and 
math while meeting the social and 
emotional needs of our students.”

AbbVie supports nonprofit organizations advancing education for the underservedIn its fifth year, our signature global volunteer event,  
Week of Possibilities, saw AbbVie participants in 
56 countries donate more than 37,000 hours of 
community service. Adding the community engagement 
throughout the remainder of the year, AbbVie employees gave 
more than 93,000 hours worldwide. In addition, over 12,000 
employees – over 87 percent of those eligible and triple the 
industry standard – participated in our North America employee 
giving and matching program, generating $11.8 million to 
benefit more than 6,000 charities.
We deepened our commitment to addressing the 
academic achievement gap for children and adolescents in 
underserved areas. In 2018, we donated a total of $95 million 
to four nonprofit partners working in our communities.
North Chicago Community Unit School District 187: AbbVie donated $40 million to fund the 
rebuilding of the district's only middle school: Neal Math & Science Academy. This donation will 
provide a safer, modernized learning environment to improve student success and aims to help 
improve graduation rates, reduce dropout rates and increase college and career readiness. The 
district will focus on supporting social/emotional learning and strong relationships between 
students and teachers, and increasing access to high-quality academic programs.
Communities In Schools (CIS): The nation's largest organization dedicated to empowering at-risk 
students, CIS works to ensure every student is offered an equitable opportunity to excel in the 
classroom and beyond. AbbVie's donation of $30 million will allow CIS to provide essential support 
services to nearly 100,000 underserved children, including children in 16 high-need Chicago public 
schools. This investment represents the largest single corporate donation Communities In Schools 
has received in its 40-year history.
The University of Chicago Education Lab: The Education Lab partners with Chicago Public 
Schools, local nonprofits and city government to identify and test innovative ways to improve 
outcomes for Chicago's most vulnerable youth. AbbVie's $15 million donation will expand the Lab's 
partnership with Chicago Public Schools, supporting work to implement promising services for 
Chicago's students, and evaluate and scale these solutions in similar settings around the country.

never done. 2018 was an important year in our journey, but 
we look ahead knowing that there is more we can do.
We hope to continue advancing the health and well-being of 
patients around the world. As we anticipate new medicine

medicine, through a wide range of collaborative efforts to 
advance disease management, health system capability 
development and disease elimination.
We've made great strides in building AbbVie's culture, and we'll 
keep moving forward. Embracing diversity and inclusion, being innovative and performance-driven, acting with integrity and 
giving back are what enable us to help transform the lives of 
patients and communities.  As a young company, we’ll continue 
to nurture and deepen this culture. 
We remain committed to reducing our environmental footprint 
even as our business grows. Looking ahead we’ll seek to 
continue and replicate strategies that have been successful 
and add new ones. 
In the coming years, we look forward to seeing the impact of 
recently launched programs and partnerships, in particular the 
historic donations we have made to nonprofits in 2018. We’re 
proud to play a part in the collaborative effort of building long 
term community strength, and to supporting the patients, families 
and employees whose well-being is at the heart of our mission.

Supporting recovery and  
resilience in Puerto Rico 
In the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, 
communities in Puerto Rico were left devastated—
the hurricanes had destroyed homes, caused widespread 
power outages that lasted for months and 3,000 people 
perished. With infrastructure including community health 
centers destroyed, many left the island, leaving a shortage 
of medical workers. Dr. Yania López Álvarez, a new doctor 
who had recently returned to Puerto Rico to practice in her 
home country, chose to stay and help lead recovery efforts. 
The nonprofit relief organization Direct Relief stepped in to 
not only provide immediate and vital care to those in need, 
but also to work with doctors like Dr. Lopez to rebuild Puerto 
Rico’s primary health care system. AbbVie's $50 million 
donation helps Direct Relief to do this critical work. This 
includes partnering with the Puerto Rico Department of 
Health and the University of Puerto Rico and Ponce Medical 
School to launch the Telemedicine to Increase Health Care 
Access program, so that specialists like Dr. López can 
consult with patients and their providers directly and help 
assess how to manage their condition and whether they 
need to visit a health care facility.Innovative solutions for disaster 
preparedness  
Recent trends have indicated an increase in the prevalence 
and severity of natural disasters, leading to a greater need 
for preparedness and relief. AbbVie is supporting leading 
nonprofit organizations in their efforts to meet these 
challenges with innovative solutions.  
With support from the AbbVie Foundation, International 
Medical Corps is maintaining and deploying fully functional 
Emergency Field Hospitals. These mobile hospitals provide 
trauma and medical care and can deploy as soon as 24 to 
48 hours following a natural disaster. The Emergency Field 
Hospitals come stocked with supplies and equipment to 
operate independently for approximately four weeks. This 
includes medicine, food, water purifiers, tents, generators 
and communication equipment. 
Following 2018 Hurricane Michael in the Florida Panhandle, 
with AbbVie support, International Medical Corps was 
able to deliver, set up and equip two temporary clinics for 
PanCare Health, a nonprofit that operates community health 
centers in Marianna and Panama City. This ensured health 
workers were able to continue offering medical and dental 
services to at-risk populations affected by the storm. 
 “As doctors, as members of this 
community, we need to build our 
training programs, and we need to 
encourage strong foundations for 
doctors to serve in both times of 
need and of prosperity.”
– Dr. Yania López Álvarez “Now we can continue to provide 
primary and urgent care, as well 
as dental care and mental health 
support, to people who are already 
carrying the burden of dealing with 
the aftermath of the hurricane.”
