shared progress
Our success is driven by our people and their commitment to deliver affordable, reliable and  
ever-cleaner energy. Our strategy is clear – we are leveraging our strengths to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. By operating responsibly and performing with excellence, we strive  
to make Chevron the partner of choice and aim to be a force for shared progress and prosperity.  Our success rests on a culture true to our Chevron Way values – getting results the right way.message from our  
chairman and CEO
As the global energy system evolves to meet the demands of a growing world, we are focused on delivering affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy. Achieving a more sustainable future for Chevron  means drawing on our culture of human ingenuity to solve problems and deliver solutions. It also means  being an outstanding partner with businesses around  the world and with the communities we call home.These priorities inspire us to build trust through collaboration and to nurture the diverse talent  necessary to accomplish our goals. Getting results  the right way isn’t always easy, but at Chevron we  
know it’s the sustainable way. 
reducing our carbon intensity
While conversation about the energy transition often focuses on future actions, we are making progress  
today. We have identified nearly 100 GHG abatement projects to reduce the carbon intensity of our opera
-
t
ions, and expect them to deliver approxi  m
ately  
4 million tonnes of emissions reductions per year when completed. In 2021, we started 36 decarbonization projects and completed five. In 2022, we are more  than doubling the number of projects to 75 and expect to spend approximately $2 billion total on similar projects through 2028.
leading in methane management
We continue to lead in methane management in  our U.S. operations, particularly in the Permian,  where our methane intensity is 85% lower than the  
basin average. Chevron is on track to meet our  2028 target to reduce enterprise methane emissions intensity by more than 50% from 2016 levels and eliminate routine flaring by 2030.To continue making progress, we’re expanding  methane detection capabilities. In addition to  tradi
 t
ional ground-based sensors, we’re deploying 
detection technology using satellites, air  c
raft and  
drones for broader coverage. Better methane  detection is critical to reducing carbon intensity,  and our work with industry and academic partners contributes to improving the accuracy and  credibility of global methane reporting. 
new opportunities, new partnerships
Reducing carbon emissions today requires partner    - 
s
hip and collaboration, because no one company, 
industry or nation – acting alone – can meet the  
world’s energy and climate goals. This is particularly true with harder-to-abate sectors, such as manufacturing, agriculture, aviation and  heavy-duty transportation. We are working with innovators around the globe to develop breakthrough technologies and building new partnerships to scale lower carbon solutions.In this spirit, we formed Chevron New Energies, leveraging our unique capabilities, assets and customers. We’re working to grow production of products such as renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable natural gas, biodiesel and renewable  base oil. Our El Segundo Refinery was the first refinery  in the U.S. to co-process biofeedstock to make  trans
 po
rtation fuels with renew  ab
le content and  
a lower lifecycle carbon intensity. This capital- efficient project leveraged existing assets, enabled  by patented, Chevron-developed technology.

contributing to a more prosperous world
In this year’s report, we have included our contribution 
to Ipieca’s SDG Roadmap for the oil and gas sector. 
Chevron supports the United Nations Sustainable 
Devel  op ment Goals through our day-to-day operations, 
partner  ship initiatives and social investments. Tengiz -
chevroil in 2021 supported Kazakhstani companies with  
the highest percentage of total spend since 2010 – an  
example of how we can use our supply chain to create  
opportuni  ties for local businesses. Chevron’s water 
management practices utilize several methods to reduce  
operational demand for fresh water. We continue to 
partner with organizations like the World Business 
Council on Sustainable Development and are contrib -
uting to the Global Water Solutions Project to develop 
new tools to strive to make more fresh water available 
for communities where we operate. Many more  
such examples are noted in this report.
human ingenuity drives it all
We invest to develop the full potential of people, 
believing this offers the best path to a better  
future for all. 
In 2021, we made strong progress on our Racial  
Equity strategy and continued executing our  
$15 million commitment to address racial inequality  
in the United States. The health and safety of our workforce is core to  
The Chevron Way. We strive to provide effective  
health and education programs to employees and to 
residents of the communities where we operate. We 
understand that self-care, mental health and emotional 
well-being are integral to employee health, safety  
and productivity.
Through our commitment to operational excellence, 
dedi  cation to partnership, and support for developing  
the potential of our people, Chevron is focused  
on what it takes to lead the right way.

7board insight
a conversation with debra reed-klages
Independent Director Debra Reed-Klages had a virtual sit-down with Vanessa Teran, an employee 
network specialist in our Diversity, Inclusion, and Ombuds organization. Mrs. Teran is a proud 
member of Somos (Spanish for “We are”), one of Chevron’s 12 employee networks that promote 
diversity and inclusion. Somos provides leadership development, promotes inclusive behaviors, and 
helps create meaningful connections with Latin American and Hispanic employees at Chevron. 
Their discussion covered a wide range of topics – from expectations regarding the pace of the 
energy transition to the role diversity can play in managing organizational change. Ms. Reed-Klages 
shared her thoughts on Chevron’s role in a lower carbon future and the thoughtful approach we 
have taken thus far to advance an orderly transition. 
Debra Reed-Klages, Audit Committee Chair Vanessa Teran, Employee Network Specialist
chevron.com/sustainability
8Teran: Can you reflect on how Chevron is 
managing the energy transition? 
Reed-Klages:  Chevron’s approach to the energy 
transition balances ambition and reality. It recognizes 
that the energy transition is exactly that – a transition. 
The world needs energy, and advancing to a lower 
carbon future should not leave anyone behind. We are 
driving down the carbon intensity of our oil and natural 
gas production today and investing to develop lower 
carbon energy solutions for tomorrow. A diversity  
of approaches toward achieving a lower carbon future 
is essential. Chevron is targeting the sectors of the 
econo  my that are difficult to decarbonize – manufac  tur-
ing, aviation and heavy-duty transportation – because 
they are much more difficult to electrify than light-duty 
transportation. Chevron has the capabilities, assets 
and customers to drive change and innovation in 
these critical sectors, but such innovation will require 
ambitious government policies designed to align  
goals, create viable markets and serve as a catalyst  
for action. 
Teran: Can you share how the Board  
approached the launch of Chevron New  
Energies (CNE)? 
Reed-Klages:  I am really excited about CNE. Our  
port  folio of energy technologies is expected to evolve 
over time as we advance toward a lower carbon future. 
Chevron recognized that to be a future leader, we 
needed to create an organization with a singular focus 
on pursuing lower carbon businesses. CNE builds on 
Chevron’s competitive advantages and provides a 
platform to accelerate lower carbon business activities 
in harder-to-abate sectors. For example, Chevron’s 
experience in operating complex refineries supports our 
hydrogen efforts; our experience in drilling helps us  
be leaders in carbon capture, utilization and storage;  
and our customer base in harder-to-abate sectors 
benefits from our ability to develop lower carbon 
products and solutions. In addition, Chevron is a goal-
oriented organization, and CNE’s launch has helped 
focus the business on achieving the hydrogen and 
carbon capture targets we have set for ourselves.Teran: What have you learned about  
Chevron’s culture since you joined the Board? 
Reed-Klages:  I’ve been particularly struck by the  
pride employees take in their jobs and the variety and  
length of their careers at Chevron. As employees move  
through different roles, they learn the implications of  
decisions on other parts of the business and build a  
robust picture of what drives value. Employees care  
about colleagues and business performance because  
they want to be a part of Chevron’s future. I’ve also  
been struck by the themes of caring and doing the right 
thing that permeate Chevron’s culture. For example, 
Chevron discloses GHG emissions data and established 
carbon intensity reduction targets on an equity basis –  
covering GHG emissions from company-operated 
and nonoperated joint ven  tures. Despite having less 
control over nonoperated joint ventures, transparently 
communicating our progress toward achieving global 
GHG emissions reduction goals is the right thing to do. 
Teran: How does the Board embrace  
diversity and why does diversity matter? 
Reed-Klages:  In November 2021, Chevron was 
recognized by the Women’s Forum of New York for 
having more than 40% of our Board seats held by 
women. Overall, the Board seeks to achieve diversity of 
age, gender and ethnicity and recognizes it’s important 
to refresh Board membership and committee chair 
positions to introduce fresh ideas and perspectives. 
This multidimensional diversity enables the Board to 
challenge itself and management from different points 
of view. Chevron believes innovative solutions to our 
most complex challenges emerge when diverse people, 
ideas and experiences come together in an inclusive 
environment. I believe diversity brings not only new 
ideas and perspectives, but also resilience through 
change. Inclusion cultivates authenticity and a sense 
of belonging that can foster meaningful connections 
among employees. These connections can give people 
the strength they will need as our business evolves  
and we advance a lower carbon future. 
“I believe diversity brings not only  
new ideas and perspectives,  
but also resilience through change”

10focusing on  
what matters
stakeholder engagement and issue prioritization
Our sustainability reporting focuses on environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) issues that matter to our business  
and our stakeholders. Thoughtful engagement around priority 
issues (sometimes called “material issues” in the context 
of ESG reporting frameworks 1) helps us assess and, where 
necessary, refresh our ESG strategy and commitments and 
validate priorities in relation to business risk and opportunities. 
The content for our Corporate Sustainability Report  (2021)  
was identified through issue prioritization processes  
and engagements with internal and external stakeholders 
through  out the year. To gain insight into ESG issues and 
reporting trends, we engage with numerous third-party 
groups, including: World Business Council for Sustainable 
Develop  ment, World Economic Forum, Business for Social 
Responsibility and Ipieca. In addition, we benchmark and 
obtain third-party reviews of our prior year’s Sustainability 
Report  and send questionnaires to more than 100 internal 
subject matter experts and stakeholders to test our thinking. 
In 2021, we had more than 100 engagements with investors 
and other stake  holders in which a wide range of issues 
was discussed, such as climate change, corporate culture, 
cybersecurity, water, human capital management and 
employee mental health following COVID-19. As part of our 
reporting cycle, we provide relevant members of the Executive 
Leadership Team and senior management, the Global Issues 
Committee, and the Board’s Public Policy and Sustainability 
Committee with the opportunity to review and provide input  
to the planned content for our voluntary Sustainability Report . 
Since 2020, we have partnered with Datamaran, an ESG  
risk identification and monitoring software company that  
uses a comprehensive data-driven process to identify, 
prioritize and monitor ESG issues. Its business intelligence 
tool aims to leverage artificial intelligence to incorporate 
a wide array of inputs, including corporate reports, global 
regulations, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) metrics, social media and online news. We believe  
this tool is one of many useful inputs into our overall process 
for assessing the relevance of ESG issues and trends and  
that it helps us evaluate our alignment with diverse and 
sometimes competing stakeholder interests. 
Commitment to transparency
We demonstrate our commitment to transparency by report -
ing metrics and performance data annually. To deter  mine 
which metrics to include, we consider the reporting guidance, 
indicators and terminology of the SASB, Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Sustainability 
Reporting Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry  (2020) by 
Ipieca, the International Association for Oil & Gas Producers 
and the American Petroleum Institute, as well as other leading 
reporting frameworks. We have also disclosed our ESG data, 
including GHG emissions data, in the IHS Markit ESG Reporting 
Repository to enable investors and other stakeholders to 
efficiently compare ESG data across sectors and reporting 
frameworks in the absence of consistent mandatory reporting 
requirements.
Responding to our stakeholders 
Our stakeholder engagement process has resulted in  
action in our business and enhancements to our reporting. 
These are but a few examples:
• In 2021, in response to a proxy proposal and investor feed -
back, we created an updated lobbying and trade association 
webpage that includes additional transparency on both 
lobbying and political contributions.
• Discussions with investors have shaped our reporting  
and led us to utilize SASB and TCFD frameworks for 
sustainability disclosures. Beginning in 2019, we enhanced 
our reporting by aligning our performance data table with 
the recommen  dations of the SASB voluntary framework, 
as reflected in our SASB index column. In 2020, we began 
considering how our data related to the core Stakeholder 
Capitalism metrics devel  oped by the World Economic 
Forum. These enhance ments help provide comparable 
information for investors and other stakeholders. 1  With respect to the use of the term material, individual companies are best  
suited to determine which information is material under the long-standing  
U.S. Supreme Court definition of that term, and whether to disclose this infor -
mation in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission financial filings.

in job selection pro  cesses. Chevron identifies leaders to 
participate in our internal job selection meetings who  act as a neutral third party focused on recognizing 
unconscious bias. The goal is to facilitate open  
discussions and bring more transparency to our  
decision-making processes.

continue today as we help evolve the energy future. Our 
primary objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon 
and superior shareholder value in any business environment. 
Many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain 
a significant part of the energy system for years to come and 
that the energy mix will increasingly include lower carbon 
intensity sources. The world’s energy demands are greater 
now than at any time in human history. Affordable, reliable, ever-cleaner energy is essential to 
achieving a more prosperous world. Our strategy is  
clear – leverage our strengths to deliver lower carbon  
energy to a growing world. Our capabilities, assets  
and customers are distinct advantages. We are building  
on these strengths as we aim to lead in lower carbon  
intensity oil, products and natural gas and to advance  
new products and solutions that reduce the carbon

14achieving net zero at least cost to society
We aspire to achieve net zero Upstream emissions (Scope 1  
and 2) by 2050. Accomplishing this aspiration depends  
on continuing progress on commercially viable technology; 
govern  ment policy; successful negotiations for carbon 
capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and nature-based 
projects; the availability of cost-effective, verifiable offsets in 
the global market; and the granting of necessary permits by 
governing authorities. 
An economically efficient approach to GHG abatement 
An economically efficient approach to GHG abatement is to 
prioritize efforts that curtail emissions at the lowest cost per 
tonne, irrespective of the sectors in which those abate  ments 
occur. Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs) provide 
Chevron with a methodology to identify and prioritize a port -
folio of the most promising GHG abatement opportunities 
across operations. This MACC approach has provided other 
companies and gov  ern ments with investment insights that 
focus on achieving the greatest volume of GHG reductions at 
the least cost to society. 
Reduce carbon intensity of our own operations 
Our target for Upstream oil and natural gas intensity is  
24 kg CO 2e/boe. To reduce the carbon intensity of our own 
operations, we have identified nearly 100 projects and  
plan to spend more than $300 million in 2022. In 2021, we 
made progress on 36 pro  jects and completed five. We expect 
to spend approxi  mately $2 billion total on similar projects 
through 2028. When completed, the projects are expected  
to deliver approximately 4 million tonnes of emissions 
reductions per year. In the years beyond 2028 in our MACC port  folio planning, we have identified opportunities that have 
the potential to further lower our Upstream carbon intensity to 
the mid-teens, helping us get closer to our net zero Upstream 
aspiration. Significant technology advancements and the 
development of large offsets markets could enable reductions 
to net zero by mid-century. 
using carbon price as the primary policy tool 
In 2020, more than 60% of our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 
equity GHG emissions were in regions with existing or devel -
op ing carbon-pricing policies. Equity emissions include 
emissions from operated and nonoperated joint-venture 
assets based on Chevron’s financial interest. To reduce 
emissions, we believe a price on carbon is the most efficient 
mechanism for public policy because it harnesses market 
forces. For example, our Eastern Mediterranean business unit 
supported Israel’s adoption of a price on carbon as the primary 
policy tool for fulfilling the state’s carbon reduction goals.  
By adopting a market-based approach to carbon reduction, 
Israel has shown it’s at the forefront of countries around the 
world in addressing global climate change.
We use carbon prices and  
derived carbon costs in  
business planning, investment  
decisions, impairment  
reviews, reserves calculations,  
and assessment of  
carbon reduc  tion and new  
energy opportunities.upstream net zero 2050 aspiration

15developing a balanced and measured approach 
A balanced and measured approach aims to meet long- 
term economic, environmental and energy-security needs; 
allocate costs in an equitable, gradual and predictable 
way; and consider both GHG mitigation and climate 
change adaptation. Policies should promote market-based 
mechanisms that create a level playing field, do not pick 
winners or losers, and eliminate inefficient, higher-cost direct 
regulations. As a California-based company with significant 
operations and investment in the state, we have a long history 
of engagement and advocacy both directly and through 
our trade associations. This has included engagement and 
advocacy regarding California’s cap-and-trade program, 
the first economywide carbon-pricing program in the United 
States. This program uses several key design elements of 
balanced and measured climate policy by covering all sectors 
of the economy, leveraging carbon pricing and crediting 
additional emissions offsets outside its cap. 
supporting promising technologies
Well-designed climate policy supports research, development 
and early-stage deployment of promising technologies. At 
the federal level in the United States, Chevron supported the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act’s inclusion 
of critical provisions encouraging development of carbon 
capture, utilization and storage and hydrogen technologies. Early-stage federal investment can help the United States 
become a leader in developing emerging technologies that the 
world’s leading energy and climate experts deem critical to 
addressing climate change. 
engaging globally
Climate change requires global engagement and action. 
We believe market-based mechanisms applied across the 
broadest possible coverage of emissions are the most 
effective and efficient way to reduce emissions. As a member 
of the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), 
Chevron has supported IETA’s mission to be the trusted 
business voice on market-based climate solutions. Through 
IETA and other business groups, Chevron remains engaged 
as official observers to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, which seeks to build global 
consensus on cooperative approaches between governments, 
NGOs, research organizations and other stakeholders to 
achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.
In addition, well-designed policy should enable linking with  
other markets to build a globally coordinated system. Linking 
to other jurisdictions directly or through flexible market mecha  -
nisms such as offsets can create opportunities for global 
coordination while avoiding unintended trade and investment 
impacts and the risk of offshoring jobs and emissions.

Consistent and comparable climate reporting
We aim to lead the industry in transparent climate change-
related reporting and support efforts to enhance the 
comparability and consistency of such information in public 
disclosures. We have voluntarily reported our greenhouse gas 
emissions, including Scope 3 emissions from the use of our 
products, for nearly two decades. In 2018, Chevron was among 
the first oil and gas companies to publish a report aligned with 
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, and 
we issued a fourth update in October 2021. We helped the 
American Petroleum Institute develop a voluntary template 
for oil and gas companies to report core GHG emissions data 
to enable greater comparability in climate-related reporting. 
Full value chain carbon accounting
We believe transparent data and policies enable consumer 
choice and the most efficient GHG reductions. In addition, 
verifiable, full value chain carbon intensity data can enable 
price discovery, a comparison of the “green premium,”  
and a supply chain of affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner 
products. In 2021, we introduced a portfolio carbon intensity 
(PCI) metric that represents the carbon intensity across  the full value chain associated with bringing products to 
market, including Scope 3 emissions. This methodology  
is available on our website  for anyone to use and compare 
energy companies. In our case, Scope 3 emissions result 
principally from customers’ use of the products we sell and  
are the largest category of emissions associated with 
Chevron’s activities. Our PCI target for 2028 is 71  g CO2e/MJ,  
a > 5% decrease from 2016.
Responsible lower carbon energy
In collaboration with Pavilion Energy and QatarEnergy,  
we jointly developed a liquefied natural gas (LNG) carbon-
footprinting methodology for delivered cargoes to help 
advance a standard for GHG product-level accounting.  
This methodology is expected to improve accuracy and build 
stakeholder confidence in data reliability. In early 2022, we 
announced a one-year pilot with Project Canary to enhance 
our ability to demonstrate transparency in how we are  
lower  ing methane emissions in our operations. Project  
Canary will use its comprehensive TrustWell™ Certification 
program to review and analyze the environmental and social 
performance aspects of individual wells and facilities in 
Colorado and Texas.

GHG reduction projects and exploring emerging technology 
to identify opportunities to further lower emissions. Our 
planned GHG reduction projects include opportunities to 
reduce vent  ing, such as a nitrogen blanket system for the tank 
farm at Tengizchevroil (TCO), and to reduce flaring, which also 
reduces methane emissions. Our standard facility design in 
the Permian Basin includes methane emission controls, such 
as vapor recovery units at central tank batteries and pneumatic 
controllers that utilize compressed air instead of natural gas. 
We are committed to further improving methane detection and 
direct measurement through our global methane detection 
campaign, which focuses on scaling up proven and emerging 
detection technologies and modes of deployment, such 
as satellites, aircraft and drones. To date, we have completed 
campaigns in Argentina, the Denver-Julesburg Basin, the  
Gulf of Mexico, the Permian Basin and TCO.We are active participants in multiple partnerships and 
associations focused on methane emissions. Chevron is a 
founding member of the Collaboratory to Advance Methane 
Science (CAMS), a joint industry project to conduct peer- 
reviewed research around methane emissions. Recent CAMS 
projects include an aerial survey to understand sources 
in the Permian Basin and the first measurement study of 
methane emissions from LNG transport activities. Chevron 
is also a founding partner of the Environmental Partnership, 
an industry initiative aimed at accelerating the adoption of 
practices that reduce methane emissions. To date, companies 
in this initiative have conducted more than 770,000 leak 
detection surveys and replaced more than 27,000 pneumatic 
controllers with lower- or non-emitting technologies. Recently, 
the Environmental Partnership collaborated with several 
aerial survey technology providers, including the NASA Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory/University of Arizona, GHGSat, Bridger 
Photonics and Kairos Aerospace.
leading methane intensity performance in the permian basin
We’re investing to reduce methane emissions and flaring. Improving methane detection,  
rethinking facility designs, optimizing equipment and deploying new operational practices  
are a few examples of the projects underway to lower emissions.
Our Mid-Continent business unit has piloted eight advanced  
methane detection solutions since 2016 and selected an aerial laser-  
based methane scanning technology for broader deployment  
in the Permian. Aircraft-based solutions help us and other nearby  
operators cost-effectively screen assets for methane emissions  
across a wide geographic footprint in the Permian.

18reducing flaring 
We flare natural gas only when necessary for safety and 
operational purposes and in areas where pipelines and other 
alternatives for transporting gas do not exist. Our 2028 
Upstream carbon intensity target includes a specific target for 
flaring intensity of 3.0 kg CO 2e/boe, which is a 66% reduction 
from our 2016 baseline. Chevron endorsed the World Bank’s 
Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative, which brings together 
govern ments, oil companies and development institutions  
to cooperate to eliminate routine flaring by no later than  
2030. Chevron is an active participant in the World Bank’s 
Global Gas Flaring Reduction (GGFR) voluntary partnership.  
GGFR recently partnered with the Payne Institute for 
Public Policy at the Colorado School of Mines to develop a 
transparent web platform to support real-time mapping  
and tracking of global gas flaring data. Chevron supported  
this partnership through our membership in the Oil and  
Gas Climate Initiative.
applying world-class capabilities 
Future progress will require applying our world-class 
capabilities as we aim to deliver higher returns in a lower 
carbon world. Our capabilities, assets and customers  
are distinct advantages. Chevron Technology Ventures  
targets external innovation and transformational tech -
nology. The Chevron Technical Center develops and deploys 
technology across the entire business, including integrating 
low-carbon technology into our operations. In 2021, we 
formed Chevron New Energies, a new organization dedicated 
to growing hydrogen, CCUS, offsets and other emerging 
energies. Chevron Strategy and Sustainability continues to 
steward the company’s long-term strategy by integrating 
climate change, energy transition and other sustainability 
themes into macroeconomic forecasting, supply-and-demand 
forecasting, price forecasting, portfolio modeling and 
competitor intelligence.
houston CCS
Chevron and more than 10 industry partners have agreed  
to support large-scale deployment of carbon capture  
and storage (CCS) to help decarbonize industrial facilities  
in Houston, Texas, one of the largest concentrated sources 
in the United States. The organizations are considering 
using CCS technology at facilities that generate electricity 
and manufacture everyday products such as plastics, 
motor fuels and packaging. The collabo  ration could lead  
to capturing and storing up to 50 million metric tons of  
CO 2 per year by 2030 and about 100 million metric tons  
by 2040.

Early in 2021, I was asked to serve as project manager  
for Chevron’s methane detection campaign, which  
is tasked with deploying methane detection technology  
to cover 80% of our equity emissions. 
Our team works with business units across Chevron’s 
asset classes to design tailored methane detection 
solutions to accommodate operational needs, policy 
concerns and regulatory protocols. We are experi  - 
ment  ing with a variety of technologies to expand our 
methane detection capabilities, including deploying 
airborne sensors using satellites, aircraft and drones.  
In addition to working within Chevron’s business units, 
we also collaborate with regulators, universities and 
other operators to evaluate equipment and share 
best practices.
I’m especially proud of our work with the Gulf of  
Mexico business unit, where we became one of the 
first oper  ators to deploy a methane detection solution 
offshore using drones. Offshore is especially challenging 
because ocean water can confuse detection technology 
and create false readings. In addition, platforms have 
layered equipment, which can make it difficult to identify 
the source of emissions from overhead sensors alone.  
To solve this challenge, we combined emissions detec -
tion equipment from our San Joaquin Valley business 
unit with drones used offshore and developed a new 
flight procedure to detect methane emissions from the 
platforms. After identification, the business units work  
to remove or mitigate the emissions source.
Methane reduction is a global challenge, and there is  
not a one-size-fits-all solution. I am inspired by  
the level of expertise within our company and our  
culture of innovation and experimentation.eliminate

developing hydrogen as a fuel source 
Chevron’s approach to hydrogen envisions the use of green, 
blue and gray hydrogen. We believe the use of blue and  
green hydrogen as a fuel source can help reduce the amount 
of GHG emissions entering the atmosphere. Although gray 
hydrogen is viewed as not directly supporting decarbonization 
of the energy sector, we believe that early-use cases of gray 
hydrogen can provide key opportunities to minimize the 
risks of technology; enable development of supporting infra -
structure, including fueling stations; and contribute to lessons 
learned. Chevron holds more than 75 patents in hydrogen from 
early commercial ventures that are applicable to our future 
development plans. 
We have agreements in place with Toyota, Cummins and 
Caterpillar to explore commercially viable hydrogen opportu -
nities. These agree  ments cover an array of topics, from public 
policy to hydrogen-powered transportation to infrastructure.

20growing our carbon capture business 
Achieving net zero Upstream emissions by 2050 is unlikely 
without scaled deployment of CCUS and other CO 2 removal 
tech  nologies. We see CCUS opportunities in two areas: 
reducing the carbon intensity of our existing assets and grow -
ing our carbon capture business, primarily through hubs with 
third-party emitters as partners and customers. Our initial 
carbon capture projects have been focused on decarbonizing 
existing assets – such as our Gorgon facility, one of the largest 
sequestration projects in the world, with the capacity to  
store up to 4 million tonnes of CO 2 per year – providing us  
with key operational experience. Enterprisewide, we are 
targeting 25 million tonnes of CO 2 per year in equity storage 
by the end of this decade. 
To achieve these ambitions, we’re exploring several hub 
opportunities in the United States and abroad, each including 
multiple large customers and with facility nameplate capac -
ities of between 5 million and 20 million tonnes of CO 2 per 
year. We are advancing collaborative efforts with the U.S. 
Department of Energy and Svante to help develop innovative 
new technology to potentially reduce carbon capture costs. 
In addition, Chevron invested in Blue Planet to leverage carbon 
capture to produce low-carbon construction materials and to 
reduce the carbon intensity of industrial operations. In early 
2022, we announced an increased investment in Carbon Clean, 
a U.K.-based company with advantaged capture technology 
that is designed to reduce the costs and physical footprint 
required for carbon capture, minimizing site disruption and 
facilitating faster permitting. This partnership is an important 
step toward growing our future large-scale CCUS business.investing in scalable, nature-based solutions 
Offsets are expected to make up a notable portion of global 
reductions, especially in sectors that are harder to abate or 
do not have cost-effective reduction opportunities. We are 
investing directly in scalable, nature-based solutions – like  
soil carbon storage, reforestation and mangrove restoration.  
In addition, we plan to monetize excess high-quality credits. 
We expect to be a portfolio supplier of offsets by providing 
more customers with offset-paired products. In March 2022,  
we announced an agreement with Restore the Earth Foun -
dation for a reforestation project for up to 8,800 acres  
of property in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, U.S. 
Chevron’s experience in developing and using offsets dates 
back nearly two decades and is an important part of our 
operations in Australia, Canada, Colombia and California. 
We have a global carbon trading organization and actively 
participate in multiple registries and exchanges. Chevron is a 
founding member of the Markets for Natural Climate Solutions 
(NCS) Initiative. NCS markets provide a potentially cost- 
effective form of carbon management that can contribute  
to the goals of the Paris Agreement. In addition, Chevron is a 
consultative group member of the Institute of International 
Finance Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets 
(TSVCM). TSVCM brings together experts across the  
carbon market value chain to help build consensus on how 
best to scale up voluntary carbon markets. Chevron has 
invested in Boomitra, a startup developing an agricultural 
technology to enable farm carbon sequestration and 
monetization that has the potential to cost-effectively  
grow the supply of carbon offsets.

reducing the carbon intensity of fuels 
We are complementing the strength of our traditional 
products business with new lower carbon intensity products. 
Renewable fuels are important products that can help reduce 
the lifecycle carbon intensity of transportation fuels while 
meeting the world’s growing energy needs. To establish 
a reliable supply chain from farmer to fueling station, we 
announced a joint venture with Bunge North America Inc. to 
secure renewable feedstocks. We also intend to collaborate 
with Gevo Inc. to jointly produce sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF) and renewable blending components for motor gaso -
line. We tested a batch of SAF with Delta Air Lines and Google 
and tracked emissions data using cloud-based technology. 
The companies hope to create a common, more transparent 
model for analyzing potential GHG reductions that could be 
adopted by others. In February 2022, Chevron announced a definitive agreement 
to acquire Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG). REG is  
an inter  national producer of lower carbon intensity fuels and  
utilizes a global integrated procurement, distribution and 
logistics network to operate 11 biorefineries. The acquisition 
seeks to combine REG’s growing renewable fuels production, 
leading feedstock capabil  ities and organizational expertise 
in the renewable fuels industry with Chevron’s large manu -
facturing, distribution and commercial marketing position. 
Chevron expects this transaction to accelerate progress toward  
our goal to grow our renewable fuels production capacity to 
100,000 barrels per day by 2030 and position us to create  
an even stronger renewable fuels business that meets evolving 
customer needs. The proposed acquisition is subject to REG 
stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions.

Lead Environmental Specialist,  
Chevron Pipeline and Power 
employee spotlight
At Chevron, I’ve had the opportunity to help develop a 
more holistic waste management strategy, recognizing 
that waste is intertwined with other factors that can 
impact the environment. In this capacity, I identified 
opportunities to optimize business units’ waste report -
ing practices and trained data reporters across the 
enterprise to align with our data reporting expectations. 
I’m proud of my role in improving the quality of our 
waste data because a robust data set enables us to 
make better decisions on how to optimize our waste 
management approach. 
I’ve also served as a technical resource across the 
company, helping solve complex waste challenges and 
share best practices. I’ve helped develop new methods 
to increase waste recovery that can mitigate risk, 
reduce cost and reduce our environmental footprint. 
For example, I managed a project that developed a new 
approach to removing surface scales from scrap metal 
using a fiber laser beam delivery system. This approach 
has the potential to increase recycling options for scrap 
metal and reduce the creation of secondary waste 
streams when compared with other methods.
I’m encouraged by Chevron’s approach to waste 
manage  ment through our implementation of the Third-
Party Waste Stewardship standard that establishes  
a consistent approach for how we select and set expec -
tations for third-party-owned facilities that handle  
waste generated from Chevron operations. This pro  cess  
demonstrates how we work to influence the companies 
with whom we collaborate and illustrates Chevron’s 
commit  ment to our core values, which include protection 
of human health, safety and the environment.The ERMP provides a framework to identify, assess, mitigate 
and manage environmental risks, including those involving 
community health and social risks, across the lifecycle of an 
asset. The process is designed to be fit-for-purpose so that it 
can be applied to activities with a broad range of complexity, 
including large projects and ongoing operations. The ERMP 
leverages the principles of our former Environmental, Social 
and Health Impact Assessment (ESHIA) process and requires 
each business unit to address a broad scope of relevant 
environmental impacts. Though it is recommended that all 
new projects and activities apply the ERMP, business units 
have until year-end 2023 for full implementation. 
digital solutions 
Future environmental solutions rely on a strong foundation  
of standardized workflows, data automation, analytics  
and process integration. First deployed in 2020 at the 
Richmond Refinery, our Integrated Waste Solution (IWS) 
creates a digital interface between the personnel managing 
operations that generate waste and the environmental 
personnel responsible for waste handling and management. 
The solution automates and standardizes waste requests, 
approvals, track  ing and payment, which saves time and puts 
in place safe  guards. Through the development of IWS and 
related tech  nologies, we seek to streamline our reporting, 
reduce waste management storage time and align with our 
Third-Party Waste Stewardship standard designed to mitigate 
waste disposal risks.
innovation
The Chevron Technical Center (CTC) supports Chevron’s 
businesses through research, technology and capability 
development. The CTC also helps bridge the gap between 
business unit needs and externally developed emerging 
technology solu  tions such as technologies to generate 
biodiversity baselines, uninhabited aerial systems for 
environmental monitoring, real-time measurement 
tools for site assessment, and lower carbon solutions for 
environmental remediation.
Through research and development conducted in the  
Chevron Richmond Technology Center, we piloted the use  
of an infrared gun to rapidly measure total petroleum 
hydrocarbons in soil and drill cuttings at sites in California, 
Colorado and Michigan and deployed at full scale a similar 
commercially available device within our IndoAsia business 
unit. The technology eliminates the need to use any chemicals 
for sample extraction and analysis, and when used at scale,  
it enables faster turnaround and improved decision making  
in the field, which has resulted in notable cost savings.

Anew™ Circular Polyethylene, a circular polymer that can be used to make a wide variety of 
products, from automotive parts to kayaks. Both Chevron and CPChem hold certifications 
through International Sustainability and Carbon Certification PLUS, a globally recognized 
sustainability certification system for renewable feedstocks. CPChem and Chevron are 
evaluating future collaborative opportunities to reinforce both companies’ sustainability-
related efforts and to support CPChem’s annual production target of 1 billion pounds  
of Marlex Anew Circular Polyethylene by 2030, estimated to divert 1.5 billion pounds per 
year of plastic from ending up in landfills.

In 2021, 16 business units and 11 other stakeholder teams 
user-tested the new environment and stakeholder risk 
management tool, which collects baseline data for develop -
ing business unit risk profiles and assessing enterprise risk.  
We also hosted trainings to build competency with our 
qualified environmental facilitators, and these trainings 
included risk assessment workshops in Bangladesh and the 
Mid-Continent business unit. addressing plastic waste
Plastics are an essential part of modern life, and plastic waste 
should not end up in unintended places in the environment 
like rivers and oceans. We are taking steps to address plastic 
waste and support a circular economy in which post-use 
plastic is recycled, reused or repurposed. In 2019, CPChem 
became one of the founding members of the Alliance to End 
Plastic Waste, a nonprofit organization committed to reducing 
plastic waste globally. CPChem is a 50-50 joint venture 
between Chevron and Phillips 66.

25In 2021, Chevron used the World Resources Institute (WRI) 
Aqueduct tool to map our operated assets in water-stressed 
areas as defined by WRI. Six out of 15 Upstream assets  
are in areas of high or extremely high water stress, and one  
out of five refineries and one Oronite facility are also in  
areas of high or extremely high water stress. Our assets do  
not share the same physical attributes and would not be 
impacted in the same way across our portfolio. In 2021, out  
of the total amount of fresh water withdrawn by Chevron,  
19% was extracted in areas classified by WRI as having high  
or extremely high water stress. 
our approach to water management 
Chevron continues to strengthen our water management 
practices, underscoring our recognition that using water 
responsibly is integral to The Chevron Way values and  
our environmental policy and practices. We seek to protect 
this natural resource through our risk-based management 
systems, processes and standards, including: 
• Applying a risk-based approach to under  stand, prioritize 
and manage water risks across the lifecycle of our assets 
• In areas of high water stress, where water scarcity makes 
availability and access to this resource more challenging, 
utilizing water management concepts, such as efficient and 
responsible water use, reuse, recycling and conservation, 
and applying industry-standard practices to reduce water 
withdrawals for our operations, such as leveraging water  
of lower quality in lieu of fresh water and recycling and 
reusing wastewater and produced water 
• Establishing metrics to measure the effectiveness of our 
water management practices, which enables us to report 
our performance to stakeholders on a meaningful and 
regular basis2021

Heavy Oil and Water  
Treatment Specialist,  
Chevron Technical Center,  
San Joaquin Valley Business Unit
employee spotlight
I am passionate about my work as a water treatment 
specialist. My concern for cleaner water began when  
I was growing up in a poor part of India where the  
water had the highest fluoride levels in the world.  
After getting my Ph.D. in environmental engineering  
from Lehigh University, water management was the 
logical field for me to pursue. 
I started at the Richmond Technology Center conducting 
research on water treatment, and over the years, I have 
published several technical papers and have developed 
water treatments that resulted in patents. When I joined 
the San Joaquin Valley business unit (SJVBU), I took my 
research experience to the field. It has been fascinating 
to work with the process engineers, trying new concepts 
in water technology to improve efficiency while main -
taining the reliability of our facilities. The SJVBU has 
been an ideal laboratory for this work. 
I’m proud of our collaboration with Veolia, which engi -
neered a produced-water desalination plant in San Ardo. 
The produced water is treated in a multistep process 
that contains a number of safeguards to verify that the 
water meets the permit requirements to recharge the 
local groundwater aquifer. In 2021, produced water met 
approximately 98% of the San Ardo Field’s water needs, 
and more than 1,000 acre-feet of treated water from the 
field were returned for groundwater aquifer recharge. 
As the son of two professors, I have carried on their 
tradition by teaching and mentoring engineers and water 
specialists all over the world. I’m especially inspired by 
my conversations with members of the next generation 
because they recognize, as I do, that water is universally 
important to us all. alternatives to beneficially reuse produced water beyond  
what the operation requires for business needs. The consor -
tium was formed in 2019 to help meet New Mexico’s water 
needs. In 2021, MCBU was actively involved in the consortium’s 
pilot program to identify potential produced-water treatment 
technologies that will guide the state’s future actions 
regarding beneficial reuse.
el segundo refinery increases use  
of reclaimed water
Strong water management practices and innovative use  
of digital technology have enabled our El Segundo Refinery  
to increase use of reclaimed water by 8% in three years –  
from 70% in 2018 to 78% in 2021. Through recycling efforts, 
the amount of fresh water that was saved is enough to meet 
the daily water needs of 80,000 to 90,000 people in the 
Los Angeles Basin. In 2020, the refinery began using Plant 
Information Vision, a digital monitoring dashboard that tracks 
daily water use in cooling tower systems and alerts operators 
of optimization opportunities. This helps increase the use of 
recycled water in operations, thereby decreasing the use of 
fresh water. Innovative technology also helped conserve water 
during a recent tank inspection. Normally, the tank would need 
to be taken out of service and fully drained of its 1.8 million 
gallons of recycled water. But by using a robotic system, the 
refinery was able to complete its inspection without draining 
the tanks, preventing the waste of a valuable resource while 
performing a task that is critical to maintaining the integrity  
of our equipment.
singapore refinery reduces water use
Over the past five years, our joint-venture Singapore Refining 
Company (SRC) has increased the recycling and reuse of its 
process water. In 2018, Singapore’s national water agency 
presented SRC with the agency’s inaugural Water Efficiency 
Award and Watermark Award in the Refining category for 
efforts in water recycling. SRC’s journey to reducing water use 
in refining operations began in 2016 with the completion of the 
Effluent Treatment Recovery Plant (ETRP), the first of its kind 
in Singapore. Using flat-sheet ceramic membranes and a two-
stage reverse osmosis process to remove suspended solids, 
oil, grease and other contaminants, the ETRP treats water that 
would otherwise be discharged to the sea. The ETRP increased 
SRC’s capability to recycle water by up to 50%. Government 
incentives and technological advances have driven SRC’s 
recycling initiatives, and greater advances in water recycling 
are ahead. Through recycling efforts at  
our El Segundo Refinery,  
the amount of fresh water that 
was saved is enough to  
meet the daily water needs  
of 80,000 to 90,000 people in 
the Los Angeles Basin.

In 2021, Chevron joined the Global Water Solutions 
Project of the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD). Through this project, we contribute 
to deliverables and tools developed by WBCSD’s water 
stewardship workstreams, which includes providing input 
to the development of the Wastewater Impact Assessment 
Tool. Participation enables us to assess how we might apply 
these water stewardship concepts and principles to our 
refinery operations. In addition, the tool can help assess 
the potential impacts of wastewater on biodiversity and on 
fresh water at both the facility and supplier level.WRI’s definition of “water stress”: Baseline water stress measures the  
ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and ground -
water supplies. Water withdrawals include domestic, industrial, irrigation 
and livestock consumptive and nonconsumptive uses. Available renewable 
water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive water users and 
large dams on downstream water availability. Higher values indicate more 
competition among users.
Water withdrawn data cover only operated assets.
Our Fuels & Lubricants business and the Technology, Projects and Services 
(TP&S) organization were not included in this analysis. Freshwater withdrawals 
for the Fuels & Lubricants business and TP&S are minimal (0.7% of the total) 
compared with the overall use in the corporation.
MCBU’s entire freshwater consumption is considered as being withdrawn  
from a high-stressed or extremely high-stressed arid area even though parts  
of MCBU are not in a high-water-stressed area.
Data are full-year 2021 for freshwater use.

“Biodiversity” is the variation in living things in different 
regions on Earth, including the ecosystems and ecological 
processes that support them. Chevron recognizes the impor -
tance of protecting and conserving a region’s biodiversity, 
and we have a long history of working in collaboration with 
communities, industry groups, regulators and conservation 
groups to identify and protect biodiversity in parts of the 
world where we operate. 
Given the variation in biodiversity and the complexities of 
our operations, our Environment Risk Management Process 
(ERMP), under our Operational Excellence Management 
System, is designed to operationalize a risk-based approach to 
identify, assess and manage potential risks to the environment 
across the lifecycle of our assets, including those related to 
biodiver  sity. The ERMP screening step is designed to align with 
the Bio  diver  sity Indicators for Site-Based Impacts, a third-party 
methodology for aggregating biodiversity impact/benefit  
and performance data at the site level to provide indicators  of biodiversity management performance at the corporate 
level. The ERMP also facilitates Chevron’s Protective by  
Design concept, which applies the mitigation hierarchy, 
to avoid, reduce, restore or offset potential impacts to the 
environment, including on biodiversity. This includes the 
restoration of habitats, ecosystems and ecosystem services. 
Though it is recommended that all new projects and activities 
apply the ERMP, business units have until year-end 2023  
for full implementation.
When evaluating whether to operate in protected or 
ecologically sensitive areas, we consider the characteristics  
of the area, the type and proximity of the proposed operation, 
our ability to meet or exceed regulatory requirements, and 
our capability to avoid or manage potential impacts by using 
appropriately protective operating practices. When we  
engage in asset retirement and divestitures, we prioritize  
and mitigate asset retirement risks through timely planning  
and execution. When possible, we mitigate risks for residual

innovative solutions to protect biodiversity 
We invest in scientific research and develop and implement 
new technologies to manage biodiversity on and surrounding 
our assets. An example is Chevron’s Mustang comprehensive 
drilling plan (CDP), which covers nearly 100 square miles 
in northern Colorado. It was the first CDP approved by the 
Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC). 
Colorado Parks and Wildlife designated some of the Mustang 
area as high-priority habitat for Eastern Plains native fish, 
nesting areas for hawks and bald eagles, and winter range -
land for pronghorn and mule deer. This designation led 
Chevron to develop the area in a way that avoided identified 
nesting sites and wetland areas. By reducing or avoiding 
development in floodplains and wetlands, we seek to maintain 
the ecosystem support that a floodplain and associated 
wetlands provide, including water flow regulation and flood 
attenuation, water quality improvement, and other ecological 
functions that enhance biodiversity.Chevron Thailand worked to evaluate alternatives for 
retiring offshore platform jackets, revealing the potential 
environmental and social value of transforming the platform 
jackets into an artificial reef rather than removing them.  
To accomplish this, after removing the production equip  ment, 
seven jackets were lifted from their offshore location and 
laid on the seafloor near the shore, forming a reef more than 
1,600 feet long. Creation of the artificial reefs enabled Chevron 
not only to reduce asset retirement costs, but also to provide 
habitat for marine life and recreational diving opportunities,  
benefiting local fishers and communities and enabling scientists  
to further study artificial reef science and the value of such 
infrastructure in the Gulf of Thailand.
Chevron is working with Chulalongkorn University in Thailand 
and Curtin University in Australia to monitor the artificial 
reef over a three-year period, examining fish, benthic 
communities, sediment, plankton, and a range of water 
quality aspects and overall ecosystem value. In collaboration 
with the Scottish Association of Marine Science, we piloted 
a new technology in 2021, Structure from Motion 3D Photo -
grammetry, to collect and analyze video images from the 
artificial reef. The technology integrated the video images 
into geospatial software to create a 3D computer model  
that was analyzed to quantify 3D ecological characteristics  
of marine growth on the reef site.
INSITE
Chevron, as a member of the INfluence of Structures In  
The Ecosystem (INSITE) program, has contributed  
to building a legacy of scientific investigation into the 
potential influence of marine structures on the ecosystem. 
INSITE is a public/private partnership with the U.K. govern  -
ment, academia and industry that leads research projects  
and a Ph.D. scholarship program. The objective is to 
provide stakeholders with independent science-based 
studies to better understand the influence of man-made 
structures on the ecosystem of the North Sea. Innovative solutions in  
the Mustang CDP helped
reduce noise, air emissions,  
the surface footprint  
and truck traffic while
avoiding sensitive habitat  
in northern Colorado.152 
million miles
Installed pipelines now enable the  
elimination of storage tanks and emission  
control flare stacks, which reduces  
the potential for spills and avoids more  
than 152 million miles of truck traffic  
associated with hauling oil and water.
To improve facility design, COGCC agreed to extend drilling 
permits from two years to six years to provide more time 
to build infrastructure ahead of development. Installed 
pipelines now enable the elimination of storage tanks and 
emission control flare stacks, which reduces the potential for 
spills and avoids more than 152 million miles of truck traffic 
associated with hauling oil and water. This also enabled the 
upgrade of sub-facilities and the installation of new high-line 
power to electrify engines used for drilling and production 
compression, which has reduced noise and nearly eliminated 
combustion-related air emissions.
The plan also includes the reclamation of 1,471 legacy vertical 
wells, tank batteries and associated roads in the development 
area, which is expected to reduce Chevron’s surface footprint 
by 95% when compared to past practices and will return 
thousands of acres to other uses such as agriculture, rangeland 
and wildlife habitat. Recognizing the success of the Mustang 
CDP, in March 2020, COGCC approved a second 40,000-acre 
comprehensive plan, the Wells Ranch CDP, that will utilize 
similar field design and facility innovation. Chevron’s approach 
has become a model for development in Colorado.

Chevron has worked with Conservation Volunteers Australia, 
and in 2021, Chevron Australia announced a new initiative 
to support nature-based solutions to climate change. The 
initiative will result in 10 wetland locations across Australia 
receiving critical restoration. Wetlands can reduce the impacts 
of floods, offer notable ecosystem services and improve 
water quality. They are also home to a wide variety of native 
animals, fish and plants. The initiative will also contribute 
to innovative blue carbon research.
Lee Higgins
Senior HSE Specialist,  
Mid-Continent Business Unit
employee spotlight
For the past four years, my team and I have provided 
environmental support for the Mid-Continent business 
unit, working with multiple cross-functional development 
teams in Texas and New Mexico. For these projects, 
we’ve utilized Chevron’s Protective by Design concept to 
inform our decision making when developing new sites.
For example, in the East Texas Deadwood Development 
Area, we use field surveys and Geographic Information 
System data to plan flowlines and well pad locations that 
reduce potential impacts within the development area 
and to plan construction schedules to reduce vegetation 
removal during the nesting season that potentially could 
impact migratory birds. 
The Delaware Ranch Development Area in Texas 
straddles the Delaware River and is identified as poten - 
tial habitat for the protected Texas hornshell mussel.  
The project team selected a plan to separate operations 
on either side of the river that avoids impacting the 
mussel’s potential habitat. When planning development 
for the Dagger Lake Development Area in New Mexico, 
we strategically selected well pad locations that would 
avoid disturbing a designated habitat area for the lesser 
prairie chicken while still being able to access oil and 
natural gas utilizing horizontal drilling. We are also 
placing perching deterrents on taller facilities near the 
habitat area to ward off predators of the lesser 
prairie chicken. 
I feel fortunate to work for a company that is proactive 
and places a high value on incorporating environmental 
considerations into our construction and operations. 
Establishing Chevron’s approach up front enables further  
implementation of our Protective by Design concept.During construction of the Angola LNG (ALNG) facility, we 
became aware that Olive Ridley sea turtles had begun using 
the area as a nesting site. In response, ALNG engaged the 
Wildlife Conservation Society to implement a turtle conser -
vation program. A community education program was 
established within local communities about the importance  
of protecting sea turtles. Data were collected on local turtle 
populations, and risks to nesting turtles from construction 
activities were mitigated. In addition, nests were monitored  
in place or relocated to a protected hatchery. The conservation 
program started in 2006 with the support of local fishermen 
and community members, and by the end of 2020, more  
than 105,000 turtle hatchlings had been released from the 
hatchery. In 2021, ALNG signed a memorandum of under -
standing with Kitabanga Project that included a commitment 
to fund and monitor the ongoing conservation program.

employee spotlight
After receiving my Ph.D. in Earth Sciences, I joined 
Chevron because the culture aligned with my long- 
term aspirations to continue learning and growing as a 
person. For example, Chevron has a long history of  
using innova  tion and advanced technologies to unlock  
a deeper understanding of our assets. Today, we use  
data analytics, machine learning algorithms and artificial  
intelligence to improve our understanding of a range  
of topics in our industry, from stratigraphy to renewables  
and carbon capture. To advance my own digital compe -
tency, Chevron has provided access to digital training 
and experiential learning resources, opportunities to 
receive mentorship from subject matter experts, and 
time for me to work on my own small research projects. 
Chevron’s culture also values diversity, which has helped 
me embrace my own cultural heritage. As president 
of the Native American Employee Network, I’m able 
to focus on my Indigenous culture and its link with 
Chevron’s One Team approach, which values diverse 
perspectives and recognizes that each person has a 
unique skill set. 
Chevron’s Indigenous people-focused networks have 
merged into one unified global network that allows  
our former regional Indigenous networks to address 
common issues impacting Indigenous communities, 
such as recon  ciliation efforts to strengthen relationships 
between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. I often 
think about the fact that more than a third of the world’s 
remain  ing land belongs to Indigenous people. As Chevron  
continues to advance a lower carbon future and consider 
nature-based solutions, Chevron’s relationship with 
Indigenous communities will continue to grow. In addition to our Global Office of Ombuds, Chevron regularly 
conducts surveys to assess the health of the company’s 
culture. Recent surveys indicate high employee engagement, 
which is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment  
to the company’s values, strategies and purpose. In 2021, the 
company increased survey frequency to better understand 
employee sentiment throughout the year, including focused 
efforts to gain insights into employee well-being.
building a diverse talent pipeline
Our approach to attracting, developing and retaining a 
diverse workforce of high-performing talent is anchored in 
a long-term employment model that fosters personal growth 
and engagement. Chevron’s philosophy is to offer compelling 
career opportunities and a competitive total compensation 
and benefits package linking compen  sation to individual 
and enterprise performance. Chevron maintains strong 
partnerships with universities and diversity associations to 
develop and attract new as well as experienced talent. In 
addition, we have  coordinated efforts to recruit veterans, 
which are further supported by our Veterans Employee 
Network. We also look for creative, multidisciplinary 
innovators and leaders to introduce transformative ideas, 
envision new ways of working and help us grow our lower

COVID-19 pandemic, we continued our internship program 
virtually the past two summers, minimizing gaps in the talent 
pipeline, which resulted in a 91% full-time offer acceptance 
rate in 2021.
Chevron’s Welcome Back Program was created to hire, 
support and develop talented people who left the workforce 
for personal or family reasons and desire to return. Individuals 
complete a 12- to 16-week “returnship” focused on training, 
coaching and acclimation. Chevron is now considering a 
broader pool of candidates, flexible work options and a rolling 
cohort model so that we may hire into the program at any

developing talent 
We have a portfolio of learning and development programs 
designed to help people achieve their full potential by building 
leadership capabilities at all levels and by ensuring that 
the company’s workforce has the technical and operating 
capabilities to produce energy safely, reliably and efficiently. API DEI initiative
Chevron, in collaboration with the American Petroleum 
Institute’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion working group,  
is leading a workstream with Opportunity@Work, to  
recruit talented individuals from less traditional educational 
backgrounds and promote diversity. This pilot is ongoing  
in the San Francisco Bay Area and is set to launch in  
Houston in 2022.We invest in digital learning experiences to empower our 
employees to develop, maintain and enhance critical skills 
from any location. We’re also helping employees expand their 
horizons and plan for future positions with Gigs Marketplace. 
This digital platform allows employees to apply for short-term 
project opportunities across the organization to grow their 
capabilities beyond their current roles. 
We believe that leadership is not only about formally super -
vising a team or group but also about informally influencing 
peers and other colleagues. With that perspective, we believe 
that everyone in our organization has the potential to lead.  
We have multiple formal and informal leadership development 
programs. Your Leadership Our Future is our refreshed suite  
of leadership development programs with learning paths for 
all levels of employees, designed to help individuals discover 
the mindsets and capabilities that are most impactful for 
leading others in any environment. 
During 2021, we launched two formal sponsorship programs 
to build advocacy relationships between leaders and 
employees with the aspiration of developing a leadership 
pipeline that reflects the overall diversity of our workforce.  
We plan to leverage the learnings from these pilots to  
increase sponsorship activity over time.

working toward racial equity
In 2020, Chevron made a $15 million pledge to support the 
Black community in the United States to address barriers  
to equity. A year later, we continue to address racial barriers  
through education, job creation, talent and leadership devel -
op ment, and community and small business partnerships. 
Since establishing our Racial Equity strategy, we have 
progressed the following initiatives:
• Supporting the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF), 
which named Chevron Vice President and Chief Financial 
Officer Pierre Breber to its board of directors. Our spon -
sorship contributes to a TMCF scholarship program and 
creation of the Chevron Energy Innovation Summit, 
which features Chevron executives as speakers and other 
employees as judges in business case study competitions. 
• Pledging $150,000 over three years to the East Oakland 
Youth Development Center (EOYDC) and launching a 
Chevron Black Employee Network–led career-awareness 
program with EOYDC high school and college students.  
In addition, the Chevron EOYDC Special Scholarship 
Program provides funding to EOYDC graduates who need 
assistance with overcoming financial hardships resulting 
from the COVID-19 pandemic. • Expanding our Chevron Leadership Academy by  
establishing an academy at Prairie View A&M University.  
The program promotes leadership skills in students  
in the business, engineering and science disciplines 
and helps increase our access to diverse talent that can 
contribute to the company’s future growth.
• Establishing a Supplier Diversity Governance Board that 
provides strategic direction and oversight of Chevron’s 
supplier diversity strategy across Chevron’s U.S.-based 
business units. In addition, Chevron collaborates with  
major suppliers on an ongoing basis to influence their 
adoption of our commitment to supply chain inclusion.  
A recent win includes updating Chevron’s procurement 
policies on our Amazon purchasing platform, which, by 
the end of 2021, resulted in a fivefold increase in purchases 
with small and diverse sellers through this platform vs. 
the historical average. This commitment to a diverse and 
inclusive supply chain is founded on the belief that the use  
of inclusive practices in the procurement of goods and 
services creates a business advantage for our company, 
supports local economies and creates prosperity in regions 
where we operate.

36Chevron believes  
that we have a responsibility  
to respect human rights  
and that we can play a positive 
role in the communities  
where we operate.  
In 2021, we continued to advance our approach to respecting 
human rights by conducting assessments of potential im  pacts, 
identifying mitigations and engaging with appro  priate 
exter  nal stakeholders. We also continued to implement our 
Stakeholder Engagement and Issues Management (SEIM) 
process, through which we operationalize respect for human 
rights. In 2021, more than 19 business units updated their risk 
profiles. The types of risks captured through this process 
vary considerably and can include social and human rights 
impacts. Once a Chevron business unit identifies a risk, it 
establishes management plans to address the risk and prevent 
or mitigate potential impacts. In addition, business units are 
required to maintain a grievance mechanism as appropriate. In 
2021, six business units underwent reviews of their grievance 
mechanisms to assess their efficacy and identify opportunities 
for improvement. Also in 2021, to educate our workforce, we 
provided human rights training to more than 5,400 employees 
and contractors – including appropriate personnel who joined 
Chevron as part of the Noble Energy acquisition – using our 
updated human rights computer-based training module.

37Sofía Nuñez
Global Labor Relations Counselor
employee spotlight
Before I joined Chevron, I worked with a law firm  
in Buenos Aires that specialized in international labor 
relations, often assisting clients from abroad in their 
collective bargaining relationships. My current role is  
to provide labor relations support to business units  
on three continents. It’s a fascinating and challenging  
job because labor relations issues vary from country  
to country. 
I’m guided by Chevron’s commitment to respect the 
right to freedom of association and collective bargain -
ing, as set out in the International Labour Organization 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights  
at Work. These rights fall under the employee focus  
area of Chevron’s Human Rights Policy and align  
with The Chevron Way. As such, the Labor Affairs  
Team is a key partner, supporting business units in 
implementing our Human Rights Policy. 
I feel especially proud of the support and subject  
matter expertise my team provided one of our  
business units as they negotiated their first collective 
bargaining agreement. Similarly, we have worked  
with our colleagues in Africa to provide data-driven 
support for their anticipated negotiation of a renewed 
labor agreement next year.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the 
specific labor issues on the ground has been challenging, 
since normally I would travel to our business units and 
talk to employees. However, I’ve been able to overcome 
this difficulty by working with labor relations specialists 
to build trust and mutual understanding.which has human rights as one of its nine focus areas, and 
assesses the security management efforts within a business 
unit. As part of our commitment to continual improvement, 
Chevron will seek to identify additional opportunities to 
advance respect for human rights in conflict-affected and 
other high-risk areas across the focus areas of our Human 
Rights Policy.
addressing grievances in bangladesh
Bangladesh began managing community grievances when 
onshore seismic activities were taking place under Chevron 
Bangladesh Blocks Thirteen and Fourteen, Ltd. The process 
was subsequently expanded for use with communities 
surrounding additional operational areas and over the years 
has been enhanced based on continuous learning, a key 
attribute of rights-respecting mechanisms. For example, the 
team has established a cross-functional grievance resolution 
committee, comprising internal stakeholders across multiple 
areas, including operations, health and safety, security, and 
community engagement. This team has assessed, reviewed 
and addressed more than 50 grievances since their creation in 
2016. The types of grievances lodged have included impacts 
of security lighting and water discharge, among others. For 
example, when the grievance related to security lighting was 
introduced, a review revealed that the intensity of the security 
lighting may have been one of the contributing hindrances to 
the ability for some crops located very close to the fence 
to complete the process of photosynthesis. To contribute to 
remediation, the angle of the lighting was changed and the 
intensity of the lighting reduced. 
respecting human rights in equatorial guinea
Chevron is committed to respecting human rights in the 
communities where we operate. Since 2018, the Equatorial 
Guinea business unit has supported Ven Amiga (Spanish 
for “Come Friend”), an anti-trafficking initiative run by the 
nonprofit organization Por la Igualdad y por los Derechos 
Humanos de la Mujer en África (IDHMA). The program is 
conducting a national prevention and awareness campaign, 
mobilizing communities at all levels to prevent human 
trafficking. It focuses on mitigating the risks to vulnerable 
groups such as women and children and raising awareness of 
the risks of labor exploitation. The target audience includes 
educators, students, community leaders and the public.  
As the only NGO working on anti-trafficking measures in 
the country, IDHMA is working with the government of 
Equatorial Guinea to advocate for the enforcement of laws 
and prevention of human trafficking. Supported by the 
U.S. Embassy and working across sectors, it is also utilizing 
innovative methods to educate, inform and galvanize 
support. Chevron is proud to support IDHMA’s work with the 
government of Equatorial Guinea, the U.S. Embassy and  
other entities as a part of this cross-sector collaboration.In Bangladesh, a team

39building trust and integrity
Chevron and the city of Richmond share a history that 
stretches back more than a century. Established in 1902,  
our refinery in Richmond was Chevron’s first major refinery  
and creates products that fuel progress in Richmond and 
around the world. Chevron is committed to being good 
neighbors and providing affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner 
energy. The refinery supplies approximately 60% of the jet 
fuel for major Bay Area airports, approximately 20% of the 
gasoline in Northern California and 100% of the paraffinic 
base oils on the West Coast. We also host the campus of the 
Richmond Technology Center, a world-class scientific research 
facility that supports Chevron’s worldwide operations and 
has developed some of the world’s most significant energy 
innovations. We do all of this with a focus on improving 
our environmental performance. In 2021, Chevron released 
an update to the Stakeholder Engagement and Issues 
Management (SEIM) process. Our goal is to improve how  we manage environment, social and community health  
risks across our business and the lifecycle of our assets.  
At the Richmond Refinery we can see these aligned  
processes in action. 
respecting communities 
Chevron aims to be a leader in health, safety and envi  ron-
mental performance. The protection of people, assets, 
communities and the environment is our highest priority.  
We have a long-standing commitment to reduce criteria air  
pollutant emissions in Richmond. The refinery has funded  
an independently operated community air monitoring 
program since 2013 and we have reduced particulate matter 
emissions refinery-wide by 30% since 2018. Our community 
outreach includes ways to promote two-way dialogue,  
provide access to quality, reliable data, and support the  
health and safety of our community. Air monitoring is  
one of the tools used to understand neighborhood criteria  
air emissions and increase transparency.

Our strong distribution network, coupled with excess capacity 
in a new hydrogen unit, is expected to put Richmond in an 
advantaged position to grow a profitable hydrogen business. 
We plan to use Richmond’s volumes, combined with existing 
and future strategic partnerships, as the foundation to support 
demand growth in the heavy-duty transportation, industrial 
and power sectors. In addition, we recently initiated two green 
hydrogen pilot projects – one utilizing a gasified waste stream 
and another a solar-powered electrolyzer.
Richmond is just one example of how we seek to continue 
improving our environmental performance, enhancing 
community partnerships and enabling significant economic 
impact development. We have learned through decades of 
experience that our success is directly tied to the progress and 
prosperity of the people we work with and the communities 
where we operate.

The 3,000 employees and contractors who serve our 
Richmond operations make us the city’s largest employer. 
Among those employees are generations of families who 
have seen their children, cousins, aunts and uncles, and even 
some grandchildren enjoy careers at Chevron Richmond. 
The refinery has a variety of programs that build our talent 
pipeline and grow leadership capabilities at all levels to ensure 
the company’s workforce has the technical and operating 
capabilities to produce energy safely and reliably. One in 
particular, the Regional Occupational Program (ROP), is a  
free job readiness course offered through a partnership with 
the Richmond Refinery and the Contra Costa County Office  
of Education that helps prepare community members for jobs 
in the petrochemical and related industries. Students from  
all walks of life learn the basic pro  cesses and equipment 
common to the industry and have an opportunity to make 
connections with local employers. Since 2015, Chevron 
Richmond has directly hired more than 115 ROP graduates  
as either maintenance mechanics or process plant operators, 
and other program graduates have gone on to work for  
other facilities or companies across the energy industry.

a 55% reduction in malaria parasites among children aged  
2 to 14 and a 63% reduction in the mortality rate among 
children under 5 years old, as reported by the implementing 
partner, Medical Care Development International.

For more than 30 years, PRC has served the needs of  
San Francisco’s most vulnerable people and communities, 
including those struggling with substance abuse, HIV/  
AIDS and behavioral health challenges. In 2021, Chevron  
contributed funds to support PRC programs involving  
workforce development, behavioral health initiatives, and  
diversity and prosperity health issues. PRC was formed 
through the merger of the Positive Resource Center, Baker 
Places and the AIDS Emergency Fund. Chevron’s support  
for PRC demonstrates our role in helping address the health 
risks and systematic inequities that can potentially have a 
major impact on the communities where we operate.education
Investing in the future
We believe education is critical to achieving social equality  
and enabling human progress. In 2021, we collaborated 
with the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and 
Techbridge Girls, to launch the first Summer Engineering 
Experience for Kids program aimed to introduce middle-
school girls of color to science, technology, engineering and

Chevron is helping promote effective STEM education in 
Southeast Asia through three grants to the Southeast Asian 
Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) Regional 
Centre for STEM Education. The grants aim to improve STEM 
education in both the formal and the informal education 
sectors across Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia  
through developing evidence-based policy, building capacity 
of researchers and educators, and piloting innovations  
such as career academies that can create better pathways 
from high school to further education and the workplace.  At Chevron, we work to make the world a better place. Our partnerships and investments

Jakarta, Indonesia. The five-year program, sponsored by 
The Nature Conservancy and its local Indonesian affiliate, 
Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara, is a collaboration with 
the Ministry of Environment and Forestry’s Jakarta Natural 
Resources Conservation Center. Now at its halfway mark, the 
MERA program is about to open Jakarta’s first-ever center 
for mangrove education to help build public awareness about 
mangrove ecosystem conservation. 
Providing disaster relief
Chevron has a history of providing humanitarian aid to the 
communities where we operate when they are devastated by 
natural disasters. In 2021, the company donated $3 million 
to organizations focused on supporting U.S. Gulf Coast 
communities affected by Hurricane Ida. The funds not only 
provided immediate relief, but also helped communities 
rebuild in the aftermath of the hurricane. In early 2022, 
Chevron donated $5 million to the World Food Programme 
and the Red Cross to support their efforts to respond to the 
ongoing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. As part of our Chevron 
Humankind program, the company can match qualifying 
donations made by employees and retirees and make financial 
contributions to organizations where employees volunteer.

I love my work as a social investment advisor, especially 
when I’m part of a team working to solve challenges 
confronting our organization and the communities we 
operate in. 
I was especially impressed by the passion and commit  ment 
of the Chevron and Tengizchevroil (TCO) people who 
came together to mobilize our response to COVID-19 in 
Kazakhstan. My primary role was to ensure that critical 
supplies like medicine and equipment were delivered 
quickly and efficiently to the company in charge of 
distributing the supplies to hospitals and clinics around 
the country. 
Our first shipment of emergency supplies arrived in late 
2020 at the Almaty Airport in the middle of the night. 
Our team quickly got up to speed on the airport’s new 
COVID-19 procedures and developed an understanding 
of how to manage the logistics for medical supplies.  
We spent hours making sure that the delivery of medi -
cation arrived in full and was properly documented. 
Throughout 2021, a team worked with the Kazakhstan 
Ministry of Healthcare and our nonprofit partner MAP 
Inter  national to deliver more than 14 million units of criti -
cal medicines, 20 million protective personal equipment 
items, 1.5 million single-use syringes and six CT scanners.
TCO’s team continues to work closely with government 
authorities in the Atyrau region to keep the workforce 
safe and make medical resources available. As of Decem -
ber 2021, more than 97% – or 95,000 individuals – in the 
TCO workforce had been fully vaccinated. 
I am proud of how we have all mobilized and worked in 
unison to support my country’s pandemic response.

Ipieca roadmap continues on page 45Chevron is proud to contribute to the achievement of the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  
We have a long history of investment in health, education and 
economic development with the goal of creating measurable 
and enduring value. Through our membership in Ipieca, we 
worked with the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development on the creation of an SDG Roadmap for the 
oil and gas sector  (“Roadmap”). The Roadmap identifies 
how Ipieca, as an industry associ  ation, and individual oil and 
gas companies working within the sector, can work toward 
a lower-emissions future while contributing to a healthier and more prosperous world aligned with the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development. This will allow for a uniform 
approach to demonstrating alignment to relevant SDGs for  
the oil and gas companies. The oil and gas sector has the 
potential to advance all 17 goals either directly or indirectly 
and the Roadmap identifies 10 SDGs as priority areas where 
the sector has the most influence or ability to respond to 
societal needs.
Below are select examples of Chevron’s contribution  
to the Roadmap, as of 2021.climate
SDGs:3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
7  Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern  
energy for all. 
8  Promote sustained, inclusive and sustain   able economic growth,  
full and productive employment and decent work for all.
9  Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable 
industrialization and foster innovation.12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
14  Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine  
resources for sustainable development.
15  Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial eco -
systems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification,  
and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.contributing to the UN SDGssocial

Our Board of Directors oversees and guides Chevron’s 
business and affairs. As part of their responsibility, the 
Board oversees risk management policies, practices and 
systems that are applied throughout the company. Board 
members regularly consider critical risk topics as part of their 
deliberative decision-making processes. Annually, through 
Chevron’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, they 
review financial, operational, market, political and other 
risks inherent in our business and oversee the safeguards 
and mitigations that are put in place. Also, as part of their 
responsibility, the Board oversees Chevron’s strategic and 
business planning process. Our Operational Excellence (OE) 
Management System enables us to systematically manage 
risks related to workforce safety and health, process safety, 
reliability and integrity, environment, efficiency, security,  
and stakeholders. Preventing high-consequence incidents  
and impacts starts with understanding and mitigating risks 
and maintaining a system of effective safeguards to help  
keep our workforce, the communities where we operate and 
the environment safe. 
board oversight 
The Board has four standing Committees, all composed 
entirely of independent Directors: Audit, Board Nominating 
and Governance, Management Compensation, and Public 
Policy and Sustainability. Each Committee fulfills important 
responsibilities to assist the Board’s oversight of risks and to 
build long-term stockholder value. 
In 2020 and 2021, the full Board reviewed their governance  
of potential climate change-related risks and energy transition 
opportunities with the aim of providing clarity of Board and  
Committee roles and responsibilities. Each Committee under -
took a revision of their charter in order to clearly articulate 
oversight related to climate issues and coverage of related 
Board responsibilities. The Audit Committee Charter clarifies 
the Committee’s oversight of the company’s sustainability 
and climate change-related risks as they relate to financial risk 
exposures and oversight of the corporation’s OE audit and 
assurance process. The Management Compensation Committee Charter has been 
amended to clarify the Committee’s oversight in aligning 
compensation policies and practices with stockholder interests, 
including those related to sustainability and climate change. 
The Chevron Incentive Plan was modified to include an energy 
transition category that measures progress toward activities 
that lead to achieving our GHG metrics, growing renewable 
energy and carbon offsets, and investing in low-carbon 
technologies. This addition directly links virtually all workers’ 
annual bonuses to performance measures aimed at advancing 
a lower carbon future.

49compliance and training
The Chevron Way forms the foundation of our compliance 
program through its expression of values and expectations  
for social responsibility and business conduct. Developed  
from these overarching principles, the Business Conduct 
and Ethics Code communicates expectations for ethical 
business conduct. The Code reinforces our compliance com -
mit ment and the responsibility of each employee to ensure 
that Chevron’s activities fully adhere to legal and policy 
requirements everywhere we operate. Chevron maintains 
internal accounting, administrative and operational controls  
to manage these standards of conduct and compliance.  
We communicate this requirement to our business partners 
through our contractual requirements and through ongoing 
engagement. Chevron employees and contractors receive 
training on Chevron’s Business Conduct and Ethics Code  
every two years. 
Our compliance program addresses detailed compliance 
requirements for many important subjects, including anti-
corruption, internal controls, international trade, anti-boycott, 
OE, data privacy and competition law. For each subject, 
senior-level Chevron leaders provide risk-based guidance  
on the company’s compliance requirements and training.  
In addition, we continue to expand our offering of diversity 
and inclusion trainings. Popular topics include unconscious 
bias and inclusive leadership.
Across Chevron, compliance is everyone’s responsibility.  
We take pride that our employees are constantly mindful  
of the company’s stringent compliance requirements.  
And in that spirit, Corporate Compliance issues a quarterly 
award celebrating meaningful efforts to do business the  
right way.The Chevron Hotline operates 24 hours a day, seven days  
a week and is available for anonymous reporting in multiple 
languages if someone suspects that anyone in Chevron or  
our affiliates has violated any company policy or local laws 
or has information on any activity that could damage the 
company’s reputation. Chevron does not tolerate any form of 
retaliation for reports made in good faith. This includes blatant 
actions, such as firing, transferring, demoting or publicly 
undermining someone, as well as more subtle retaliation, such 
as avoiding someone or excluding them from professional  
or social activities. It includes actions taken by managers and 
employees alike.
doing work the right way
We contribute to the communities where we work and live  
by creating jobs, developing and sourcing from local  
suppliers, and giving back in the form of social investment 
partnerships and programs. We pay taxes in jurisdictions 
around the world and comply with all applicable tax laws.  
We support the public finances of host countries by paying 
what we owe, in full and on time. Over the past decade, 
Chevron’s tax obligations have surpassed $110 billion, by 
accruing $64 billion in income taxes and more than $48 billion 
in non-income taxes, such as property taxes, severance  
taxes and payroll taxes. 
Chevron also provides a competitive total compensation  
and benefits package that enables us to attract and retain a 
highly competent global workforce. Our pay philosophy  
is to pay our workforce competitively and equitably based  
on job responsibilities and job performance. 24/7
To reinforce our Business Conduct and Ethics Code,  
the Chevron Hotline operates 24 hours a day,  
seven days a week and is available for anonymous  
reporting in multiple languages.
BPC
The Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) is a Washington, 
D.C.–based think tank that actively fosters bipartisanship 
to solve challenging issues and chart a productive 
path forward. Through our membership in BPC’s ESG 
Taskforce, Chevron participates in constructive, bipartisan 
conversation about ESG issues with U.S. government 
policymakers. We believe our work with this task force 
serves as a venue for policymakers and staffers to explore 
the fast-evolving landscape of ESG and climate risk 
disclosures and to consider bipartisan solutions.

I manage a team that advocates Chevron’s positions  
with the U.S. government and abroad. One of our 
biggest challenges is lobbying effectively at a time  
when the United States is so politically polarized.  
Our strategic time horizon is long, and we need to be 
able to work with policymakers on both sides. Our goal 
is to help enable the United States to maintain a vibrant 
energy sector, which is critical for economic vitality. 
When we don’t achieve alignment with our member 
trade groups, we may independently share our own 
approach. We seek to be a trusted and reliable source  
of information to governments around the world to 
create better policies. I’m particu  larly proud of the 
opportunity I get every day to articulate Chevron’s 
contribution to society as we work toward advancing  
a lower carbon future.lobbying
Building on our 2020 Climate Lobbying Report , we updated 
the lobbying and trade association webpage that includes a  
de tail ed description of our policies, processes and oversight.  
We now disclose all U.S. trade association memberships where a  
portion of our dues are attributed to lobbying and the range of  
lobbying expenditures made through these trade associations.  
We report a five-year history of corporate political and Chevron  
Employees Political Action Committee contributions and the 
Executive Committee reviews and endorses corporate political 
contributions and the central budget annually. All Chevron 
employees adhere to strict internal review procedures for 
all corporate political contributions, and no employee is 
reimbursed for making a political contribution. All corporate 
political contributions are made independent of executives’ 
personal political preferences and in alignment with Chevron’s 
business interests. Beginning in 2022, we are planning semi-
annual updates regarding corporate political contributions 
and employee political action committee contributions.
As part of our oversight, employees receive mandated  
online training on political compliance education, delivered to 
in-scope employees and translated into several languages.  
In addition, internal legal counsel and the political compliance 
team provide regularly scheduled training to all employees 
who might engage in lobbying activities. Some jurisdictions, 
including California, also require that lobbyists take training as 
part of their registration.

2021 was a pivotal year for cybersecurity. The threat  
landscape evolved with increased targeting of process  
control networks (PCN), exploitation of trusted software  
in supply chains, and frequency of ransomware attacks.  
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic created an environ  ment 
where a large number of employees and contractors may 
be working remotely at any given point in time, which has 
provided more opportunities for mali  cious hackers to exploit.
At Chevron, we seek to protect our people, information  
and assets by using a risk-based, multilayered approach  
to cybersecurity. In 2017, we integrated cybersecurity  
into our Operational Excellence Management System  
with the Cybersecurity for Personnel and Assets process.  2021

cybersecurity program to 
mitigate the risks inherent in 
an increasingly connected 
and challenging cybersecurity 
landscape
The prevention of high-consequence cybersecurity incidents  
is a notable goal of our Enterprise Risk Management process. 
Chevron’s Digital Transformation effort integrated 
cybersecurity into our platforms and promotes Security by 
Design, one of six digital enterprise imperatives that form 
our company’s digital strategy. Security by Design aims to 
protect Chevron’s high-value assets and the value of our digital 
solutions by making security intrinsic to the development of  
the digital solutions we build before we build them. 
assuring safeguards are in place
We test our cybersecurity program using internal and external 
assessments to verify that safeguards are in place and 
effective. The frequency and rigor of compliance controls 
cybersecurity safeguards and programs are organized  
and managed based on an internationally recognized  
cybersecurity framework developed by NIST (National

52and audits are determined using a risk-based approach. 
Because the threat landscape continuously changes, we 
use penetration testing, which simulates attacks against the 
company, employing tactics, techniques and procedures 
hackers use to achieve their objective of accessing sensitive 
data or disrupting business operations. 
In the operational technology space, cybersecurity for PCN 
(e.g., industrial control systems) is a top priority for Chevron. 
PCNs have multiple safeguards in place to protect them against 
attack. We use a risk-based approach to establish that PCN 
architecture is securely designed and implemented. 
preparing the workforce
We require employees and contractors to complete training 
either annually or biannually on a range of cybersecurity  
best practices, including information on risk awareness,  
data privacy, privileged user access and email phishing. 
Training is updated regularly to reflect current cybersecurity 
challenges and Chevron’s cybersecurity objectives. We also 
have a cyber  security awareness campaign to make the 
workforce aware of risks and threats and educate people  
on safe cyber behaviors. 
establishing resilient operations
The intensifying threat landscape and the speed and 
sophistication of the ability of malicious actors to exploit 
vulnerabilities have made cyber attacks increasingly difficult 
to prevent. Therefore, we seek to quickly identify and rapidly 
respond to cyber incidents to limit their scope and impact  
and enable us to restore normal operations as fast as possible. 
In addition, we use multiple methods to regularly test our 
cybersecurity program, including exercises that test and build 
our capabilities to enable us to maintain a ready state for 
responding to and recovering from cyber incidents. 
supporting the new way of working
Previous crises such as hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast 
prepared Chevron for the impact of COVID-19 as we shifted 
to working at home. At peak, more than 35,000 employees 
and contractors were able to work safely from home with 
the protections provided by our cybersecurity team. The 
cybersecurity team worked with vendors and partners to 
provide us with the resources needed to enable secure access 
to our network. To maintain our cybersecurity posture as 
Chevron embraces a hybrid work model, we continue to 
monitor the network and conduct vulnerability assessments, 
audits and email phishing exercises to test that we are 
appropriately managing the risk.

employee spotlight
Before joining Chevron, I was a systems administrator in 
the U.S. Air Force for eight years. That experience was 
great preparation for my current work as operational 
technology, OT, cybersecurity engineer at Chevron. 
In the Air Force, I supported all aspects of IT, from 
delivering network security to software configuration. 
As an OT security engineer, I provide digital support to 
our operations, which focuses on managing our process 
control networks. My role is to design and establish the 
guardrails for the multiple safeguards we have in place to 
prevent or mitigate impacts to our PCNs. 
One of our biggest assets is Security by Design, which 
helps build cybersecurity into a system’s architecture 
and individual solutions. Using Security by Design, my 
team works with our business units to develop guardrails 
and test that those guardrails are effective. The team 
also evaluates our vendors to certify that they’re 
secure by design – it’s a process that not only supports 
cybersecurity, integrity and reliability, but also has the 
potential to reduce costs. 
There’s also a very human side to our work. For example,  
a PCN may monitor the facility’s emissions and effluents.  
My team’s job is to put in the protocols so that we have  
confidence that the data are protected and reliable. 
Accurate and timely data enable us to have the infor -
mation to help keep our employees and the communities 
where we operate safe and healthy.

mental health
At Chevron, we recognize the importance of self-care, mental 
health and emotional well-being as part of our overall health, 
safety and productivity. We provide our employees with 
convenient access to work-site wellness programs and use 
data to evaluate effectiveness and engagement. 
Providing wellness programs
Chevron’s Healthy You program offers tools and resources 
to help eligible participants reach their health goals. The 
program is mobile and on-demand, which fits the needs of our 
global workforce to help them reduce stress, make healthier 
life choices and take steps to protect themselves from 
communicable diseases, including COVID-19. Now available 
in four languages, the program has extended its reach into 
18 countries, where it is demonstrating its effectiveness in 
supporting a healthier, safer, more productive workforce. 
Surveys found between 69% and 87% of Chevron participants 
felt the Healthy You program provided the following out -
comes: improved their productivity, helped them feel more 
committed and engaged at work, made them proud of the 
company culture, and helped them develop useful habits.  
A survey conducted by our U.S. vendor, WebMD, indicated  
the Healthy You program has helped Chevron employees 
achieve lower personal health risk rates when compared with 
other WebMD clients included in the survey.
Another resource available to employees is the meQuilibrium 
(meQ) app, a stress-management tool designed to help users 
learn ways to navigate stress, overcome negative thinking, 
and build greater resilience to the stressful thoughts and 
situations that come with daily life. Chevron meQ members 
scored higher than members at other companies in several 
key areas, including overall resilience, connection to their job 
and connection to their team. The meQ app is also available 
on-demand in nine countries and four languages.chevron’s OEMS

54Building strength and resilience 
To help support the mental health and wellness of our global 
workforce, business units may adopt additional programs 
on a site-specific basis. To maintain operations at Angola 
LNG at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an emergency 
management team listened to employees who articulated a 
need for rest, exercise and stress relief. In consultation with 
Chevron’s Health & Medical doctors, Angola LNG developed 
the Strength and Resilience Movement – a calendar of activities, 
education events and special meals to create a sense of 
community and provide opportunities for rest, exercise and 
stress relief. In Israel, workers on the Leviathan Production 
Platform engaged in a “Lose to Win” campaign aimed at 
healthy weight loss. In Thailand, we established a virtual 
mental health talk forum, created engaging activities to 
support healthy hearts and provided peer-to-peer support 
programs to increase workers’ self-reliance. 
return to the workplace
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, a large segment of 
our global workforce remained onsite to keep our facilities 
operating safely. The other members of our global workforce 
have been working remotely while continuing to provide 
effective support to our operations. During this time, we 
have actively addressed evolving issues, updating workforce 
guidelines to be consistent with the advice of leading public 
health organizations for providing a safe workplace. 
We now have a better understanding of the risks and of 
viable and effective safeguards, and we have the capacity to 
manage the impact of the virus on our operations at the local 
and regional level. Based on what we have learned, Chevron 
has developed new safeguards and operating standards and 
updated existing protocols to adjust for the ever-changing 
conditions of the pandemic, including a strategy for a paced, 
conditions-based return to the workplace that allows our 
business units to make decisions based on local conditions. 
The company also announced a hybrid work model, based on 
employee feedback and learnings from the pandemic, that 
will give employees the flexibility to combine in-office and 
remote work. We also have region-specific resources available 
to help our workforce navigate this transition. We recognize 
that the risks associated with COVID-19 might impact our 
communities to varying degrees for the foreseeable future, 
and we are counseling our employees to be vigilant and use 
the safeguards available to them.

Process Engineer,  
Pascagoula Refinery
employee spotlight
During the planning phase for recent turnarounds,  
I was 28 weeks pregnant, so I went to our local medical 
clinic to evaluate my fitness for duty because working 
a turnaround is more physical than a typical day at 
work. Performing inspections on equipment can involve 
crawling into tight spaces, climbing ladders, increased 
noise exposure and other activities in the plant. Our 
industrial hygienist provided me with recommendations 
to discuss with my doctor and supervisor to help 
keep me healthy and safe while performing my job 
responsibilities during the turnaround. 
On the job, whenever I brought up concerns to my team, 
my co-workers were available to help me. To complete 
tasks that I could not physically perform in my third tri -
mester, such as confined space entry for column inspec -
tions, I took advantage of HoloLens, which is a headset 
that can be worn in the field to provide me with a remote 
view on my iPad. My supervisor also supported my 
need for new maternity FRC (flame-resistant clothing). 
The overall support I received at this time was critical 
in keeping me safe and healthy during my pregnancy 
while enabling me to perform typical turnaround tasks. 
Completing a turnaround is an important milestone for 
any process engineer hoping to grow their capabilities, 
and I didn’t want to miss out on that opportunity. 
This experience is consistent with the way Chevron has 
supported me across my career. They have allowed me 
to be creative and open-minded with my work – and 
they have encouraged me to bring my recommendations 
to the table. Overall, I feel very fortunate to work for 
a company where I do not have to choose between a 
thriving career and the personal experience of being  
a parent.

comprehensive risk management based on data and science 
Preventing high-consequence incidents and impacts starts with  
understanding and mitigating risks. We manage risk across our six focus areas  
through a system of safeguards. Learn more at chevron.com/oems .
Monitoring heat stress and heat strain
On hot days, workers in outdoor and some indoor settings 
face an increased risk of incurring heat strain (the overall 
physiological response to heat stress), which can lead to 
significant illness and even death. To protect our workforce 
from heat strain, we are researching and piloting the  
feasibility of a wearable skin patch that could provide real-
time, automated analysis of sweat loss, electrolyte loss, 
temperature between the skin and clothing, and motion.  
Using these measurements, it’s possible to identify conditions 
that can lead to heat stress and heat strain, alert workers  
when they need to take breaks, and provide recommendations 
for replenishment of fluids and electrolytes. 
Enforcing greater road safety 
Transportation safety in the communities where we operate 
is a top priority. As a founding member of the Permian Road 
Safety Coalition, we share and advance best practices among 
the companies operating in the region as well as educate 
communities on their critical role in road safety. This initiative 
in the Permian Basin is consistent with our enterprisewide, 
risk-based approach to land transportation safety, with a 
focus on applying appropriate safeguards and controls to 
prevent serious injuries and fatalities. In 2021, Chevron started 
using road safety analytics to evaluate crash data history 
and identify high-risk road segments to understand the risks 
associated with various routes and schedules. These tools 
support our transportation safety efforts by providing drivers 
with alternative lower-risk routes. workforce safety
Chevron’s leaders drive our OE culture by managing risk 
and learning from each other. Chevron is committed to 
continuously improving safety and in this spirit, we innovate  
to find better ways to protect our workforce.
Preparing for high-risk activities
Consistent with our goal of preventing fatalities and serious 
incidents, we established Start-Work Checks (SWCs) in 
2018 for workers involved in high-risk activities. The SWCs 
require these workers to assure that critical safeguards are 
in place and functioning as intended before they start a task. 
In each case, a verifier confirms the worker’s assessment 
with leadership support from a supervisor, when required. 
SWCs are digitally available to workers on company-enabled 
mobile devices, providing access to information for each 
task. Chevron’s approach to preventing serious injuries and 
fatalities with SWCs has made our operations safer and 
positively influenced the safety of our industry. We believe 
the SWCs have contributed to our decreased fatality rate from 
2018 to 2021. The IOGP’s Safety Committee was aware of  
the success SWCs provided to Chevron’s workforce. As a 
result, the committee welcomed Chevron to voluntarily lead  
a sub-team within the IOGP Life-Saving Rules task force to 
build out verifiable SWCs. Integrating SWCs for all legacy 
Noble Energy assets is ongoing.

56Promoting active partnership 
The OEMS establishes the expectation to apply robust 
standards to assessing, managing and mitigating risks from  
all our operations, including those that employ a contractor 
workforce. Our approach to workforce safety requires training 
for all employees and contractors on Chevron’s pro  cesses, 
standards and guidelines. Building upon the success of our 
Contractor HES Management program, we developed the 
Contractor Operational Excellence Management (COEM) 
process to establish clear accountabilities, promote active 
partnership, and provide a consistent process to help prevent 
serious injuries, fatalities and loss-of-containment events.  
Key enhancements of COEM include:
• Fit-for-purpose learning methodology  
for consequence assessment
• New guidelines for working together in  
a contracting environment
• Increased rigor in HSE qualification  
standards for contractors
• Improved risk assessment process for  
evaluating a contractor’s ability to  
implement and verify effective safeguards
• Clarification of definition of safeguard  
assurance before work starts
In 2021, we piloted COEM in our Fuels & Lubricants business, 
and our other business units are developing deployment 
strategies to introduce COEM in 2022. COEM process require -
ments and standards will be integrated into prac  tical work 
instructions, training, procedures, tools and other methods.process safety
The systems to manage process safety are complex, and it 
takes people with skills in a wide variety of disciplines working 
together to keep our safeguards strong and effective.
Transforming our organization
In 2021, we completed the transformation of our organization 
and the integration of Noble Energy and launched Chevron 
New Energies. Much like managing change in our equipment 
and operations, organizational change requires a review and 
authorization process for evaluating proposed adjustments  
to anticipate unforeseen new hazards and plan for unintended 
consequences. To manage these changes, we asked experts 
and empowered our workforce to identify gaps and evaluate 
potential risks associated with the organizational changes.  
The transformation helped improve our process safety culture 
by engaging leaders who not only embraced change and 
growth but also are committed to sustaining OE performance  
at a level that meets our competitive objectives.YCAB
In Indonesia, Chevron supports the YCAB Foundation , an 
organization dedicated to breaking the cycle of poverty 
through education and innovative financing. Beginning 
in December 2021, Chevron Pacific Indonesia and the 
YCAB Foundation collaboratively held a two-month mass 
vaccination program to administer COVID-19 vaccines 
to residents of West Java, an Indonesian province where 
vaccinations had previously lagged. Outreach emphasized 
reaching vulnerable groups and those with disabilities.  
In addition, Chevron cooperated with the Health Crisis 
Center of the Ministry of Health to lease a secure warehouse 
in Jakarta to store COVID-19 donations and equipment.  
We also funded training for the Ministry of Health’s staff  
on warehouse management.
Maintaining reliability and integrity
The reliability and integrity of our equipment is another 
important dimension of process safety. We are using digital 
technologies to transform our ability to look at equipment 
across our enterprise and gain better insights to further 
improve our integrity and risk management. As of 2021, the 
harmonization and standardization of the design, operating 
and maintenance practices within our Upstream, Midstream, 
and Downstream & Chemicals businesses have enabled the 
development of an enterprisewide data system and equipment 
stewardship approach: Facilities Integrity and Reliability 
Management (FIRM). We will begin implementing FIRM in 2022.

May 2021 release of the Corporate Sustainability Report (2020). Numbers in table may not sum due to rounding.performance
We consider environmental, social, and governance 
information in both voluntary and mandatory disclosures.  
For voluntary reporting, we consider the reporting guidelines, 
indicators and terminology in the Sustainability Reporting 
Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry  (2020) by Ipieca, the 
International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), 
and the American Petroleum Institute (API). We also consider 
other leading reporting frameworks, such as the Stakeholder 
Capitalism metrics developed by the World Economic  
Forum, to determine which data to include in our tables. 
Chevron uses the World Resources Institute/World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard  
(2015) definition of three “scopes” to report GHG emissions.
enhancing our reporting
We provide index columns that map our current reporting  
data to the relevant Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB) and Ipieca frameworks. The indices are based solely on Chevron’s interpretation and judgment and do not 
indicate the application of definitions, metrics, measure -
ments, standards or approaches set forth in the SASB and 
Ipieca frameworks. Please refer to the relevant footnotes for 
information about Chevron’s data-reporting basis.
In this year’s Corporate Sustainability Report , we added  
a new table that tracks our progress toward our 2028 GHG 
emissions intensity targets. We also expanded our global 
employee diversity data to provide region and gender 
information. In line with our approach to provide comparable 
and transparent data, we developed the portfolio carbon 
intensity (PCI) methodology to enable the comparison of 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions of companies that may 
participate in different parts of the value chain. In addition, 
we are also providing a separate GHG data performance table 
based on the API Template for GHG Reporting (March 2022) 
and API Guidance Document for GHG Reporting (March 2022).

Chevron has been working in leadership roles within 
API to develop a template for reporting core GHG 
emissions data in an effort to support API member 
companies in reporting consistent, comparable and 
transparent climate-related data to the financial 
sector, policymakers, industry customers and other 
stakeholders. Additional information and a copy

ESG data quality
The accuracy of the information reflected in our report  
is important to us. Since 2004, Chevron has engaged  
an accredited assurance provider, Lloyd’s Register Quality 
Assurance, Inc. (LRQA), to verify that our Operational 
Excellence Management System (OEMS) meets international 
environmental and safety management system standards  
and specifications. In 2021, we obtained a Certificate of 
Approval that demonstrates the alignment of our OEMS  
with ISO 14001:2015 and 45001:2018 standards, as well  
as the integrity and strength of our Chevron Technical  
Center in setting the strategic direction of the OEMS and 
providing oversight and verification of its effectiveness 
throughout the corporation. 
We also engaged LRQA to provide independent assurance 
on Chevron’s processes used to create the Corporate 
Sustainability Report  for calendar year 2021 to a reasonable 
level. LRQA’s assurance engagement covered Chevron’s 
operations and activities worldwide and evaluated how 
effective Chevron’s reporting processes were in delivering 
health, safety and environmental indicators that are useful for 
assessing corporate performance and reporting information 
consistent with core and additional reporting elements  
in the Ipieca/API/IOGP Sustainability Reporting Guidance  
for the Oil and Gas Industry  (2020) and SASB Oil and Gas –  
Exploration and Production, Midstream, and Refining & 
Marketing accounting metrics referenced in the performance 
data tables. In some cases, Ipieca elements and SASB metrics 
referenced are partially reported. For more than 10 years, we have conducted independent 
third-party assurance of Chevron’s GHG emissions. In 2021,  
we expanded this assurance to include Chevron’s performance 
data, Scope 3 emissions and GHG emissions on an operational-
control basis. The objective is to assess whether the assured 
emissions data are reported in accordance with the principles 
of completeness, comparability across the organization and 
accuracy, including calculations, use of appropriate conversion 
factors and consolidation.

in Enabled Reductions may occur due to Chevron’s current practice  
of reporting offsets in the calendar year in which they were retired.  
See footnote 21 for more information on offsets.
 5 Unless otherwise noted, Scope 1 and Scope 2 data collected as of  
January 31, 2022. Data include estimates.
 6 Scope 1 includes direct emissions. For reporting, Chevron includes indirect 
sources of GHG emissions within Scope 1 that are outside of the traditional 
Scope 1 definition such as GHG emissions from processes like drilling 
and completions, and tolling agreements up to the point of third-party 
custody transfer of the oil or gas product. Direct GHG emissions related to 
production of energy in the form of electricity or steam exported or sold 
to a third party are included in the reported Scope 1 emissions to align 
with Ipieca’s Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry  
(2020). Chevron’s Scope 1 includes emissions of six Kyoto GHGs – carbon 
dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), sulfur hexafluoride, 
perfluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons.
 7 Calculation methods for Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are based  
on the American Petroleum Institute’s Compendium of Greenhouse  
Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (2009)  
or, where relevant, local regulatory reporting methodologies.
 8 When a nonoperated joint venture (NOJV) provides consolidated emissions 
data, Chevron seeks to allocate its equity share of those emissions to the 
most representative scope and GHG based on best available knowledge of 
the NOJV’s operations.
 9 Consistent with our financial accounting, Venezuela NOJV emissions are not 
included for 2021 emissions reporting.
 10 We provide methane emissions data and intensity performance as a mass 
of methane as well as its conversion under the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) 100-year global warming 
potential (GWP) to a CO 2e. Although we strive to provide consistent data  
from our operated and nonoperated assets, some nonoperated assets may  
provide their data only on a CO 2e basis. Given the common industry practice  
of using the AR4 100-year GWP, we have assumed that nonoperated assets 
that did not provide methane mass data use a 100-year GWP of 25. We 
continue to work with our joint-venture partners to provide information  
on a standardized basis to increase transparency. 
 11 Downstream includes emissions from refineries, terminals, marketing and 
distribution, including renewable fuels. Chemical and base oil facilities 
located within refineries are included in refinery emissions.
 12 Chemicals includes emissions from stand-alone chemical, additive and 
lubricant facilities.
 13 Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem) LLC data collected as  
of April 7, 2022.
 14 Other emissions include GHG emissions from Corporate Aviation, Chevron 
Environmental Management and Real Estate Company, energy management 
and power from Chevron Pipeline and Power, and the North American  
Data Center.
 15 Exported emissions are direct GHG emissions related to production of 
energy in the form of electricity or steam that are exported or sold to a 
third party. Direct GHG emissions related to production of energy in the 
form of electricity or steam exported or sold to a third party are included  
in the reported Scope 1 emissions for each segment.
 16 Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam. 
CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O are accounted for in Chevron’s Scope 2 emissions. 
Scope 2 emissions are accounted for using the market-based approach 
as described in the World Resources Institute’s GHG Protocol Scope 2 
Guidance (2015), including calculating Scope 2 emissions net of contractual 
instruments such as renewable energy credits (RECs).
 17 The scope of verification for reporting year 2021 includes portfolio carbon 
intensity, upstream carbon intensities, refining carbon intensity and enabled 
reductions, as well as total Scope 1, total Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 11 
use of sold products on both an equity-share and operational-control basis. 
For 2017–2020, third-party verification covers Chevron’s total Scope 1 and total Scope 2 equity emissions, as first reported in Chevron’s Corporate 
Sustainability Report for each reporting year. Annual third-party verification 
does not include Chevron’s equity-share emissions for CPChem.
 18 Chevron calculates emissions from third-party use of sold products in 
alignment with methods in Category 11 of Ipieca’s Estimating Petroleum 
Industry Value Chain (Scope 3) Greenhouse Gas Emissions (2016). Emissions 
are based on aggregate production, throughput and sales numbers that 
include renewable fuels.
 19 Carbon capture, utilization and storage includes both CO 2 sold to third 
parties and CO 2 (and other gas) injected for carbon storage.
 20 RECs are credits generated from renewable electricity generation within the 
United States that are retired by Chevron. Reported Scope 2 emissions are 
net of contractual instruments such as RECs.
 21 Offsets are credits generated from the avoidance or reduction of GHG 
emissions or the removal of GHGs from the atmosphere that are purchased 
or developed and then retired by Chevron, excluding RECs. Includes  
offsets retired in compliance programs. For programs with multiyear 
compliance periods, offsets are reported in the calendar year they are 
retired, except for 2017, where offsets were apportioned to the compliance 
obligation for that year. 
 22 Total Energy Consumption includes energy generated from Chevron’s 
operations and imported energy. Exported energy is not subtracted from 
the total.
 23 Manufacturing Energy Index (MEI) (Refining) is an analysis of Chevron’s 
refining energy performance based on the Solomon Energy Intensity Index 
methodology. Chevron’s MEI includes the refining assets at Chevron’s 
operated and nonoperated joint-venture refineries. 
 24 2021 Upstream Energy Intensity reflects continued improvements in 
Chevron’s calculation methodology.
 25 Pipeline Energy Intensity covers assets operated by Chevron Pipeline 
Company. Pipeline Energy Intensity for 2020 and 2021 does not include 
legacy assets acquired from Noble Midstream Partners LP.
 26 Chevron’s Non-Manufacturing Energy Index includes operations from 
Chevron’s chemicals and additives, products and services, and lubricants 
businesses. It reflects the energy required to produce Chevron’s products 
compared with the energy that would have been required to produce the 
same products in 1992 (the index’s base year).
 27 For compiling and reporting air emissions data, Chevron follows regulatory 
definitions of VOC. SO X emissions include SO 2 and SO 3, reported as 
SO 2-equivalent. NO X emissions include NO and NO 2 (reported as NO 2-
equivalent) and exclude N 2O.
 28 SO X and VOC emissions increased in 2021 due to production activity 
increases and inclusion of first full-year emissions of newly acquired and 
recommenced assets. 
 29 Fresh water withdrawn from the environment is defined per local legal 
definitions. If no local definition exists, fresh water is defined as water 
extracted, directly or indirectly, from surface water, groundwater or 
rainwater that has a total dissolved solids concentration of less than 
or equal to 2,000 mg/L. Fresh water withdrawn does not include 
effluent or recycled/reclaimed water from municipal or other industrial 
wastewater treatment systems, as this water is reported under nonfresh 
water withdrawn. Nonfresh water withdrawn could include: seawater; 
brackish groundwater or surface water; reclaimed wastewater from 
another municipal or industrial facility; desalinated water; or remediated 
groundwater used for industrial purposes. Produced water is excluded 
from fresh water withdrawn, fresh water consumed and nonfresh water 
withdrawn. Water quantities may be determined using direct measurement 
techniques or engineering estimation methods.
 30 Refining includes data from refineries, including chemical and base oil 
facilities located within refineries. 
 31 Other includes, but is not limited to, chemical and lubricant facilities, as  
well as Chevron Environmental Management and Real Estate Company.
 32 Chevron calculates fresh water withdrawn intensity for Upstream using 
gross operated production.
 33 Chevron calculates fresh water withdrawn intensity for refining using  
total refinery inputs, which comprise all feeds into the refinery. This  
includes purchased crudes for crude units and third-party feeds for other 
processing units.notes to pages 59 through 72
chevron.com/sustainability
74 34 Chevron reports fresh water withdrawn and consumed in water-stressed 
regions according to the World Resources Institute’s definition and 
categorization of “baseline water stress.” Baseline water stress measures 
the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and 
groundwater supplies. Water withdrawals include domestic, industrial, 
irrigation and livestock consumptive and nonconsumptive uses. Available 
renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive 
water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Higher  
values indicate more competition among users.
  Chevron’s fresh water withdrawn and consumed in high and extremely  
high-water-stressed areas excludes: Chevron’s Fuels & Lubricants business 
and the Technology, Projects and Services (TP&S) organization. Freshwater 
withdrawals for the Fuels & Lubricants business and TP&S are minimal  
(0.7% of the total) compared with the overall use in the corporation.  
For purposes of this reporting, Chevron categorizes all of the water 
withdrawn and consumed by Chevron’s Mid-Continent business unit as 
being in a high-stress or extremely high-stress region.
 35 Oil concentration is determined by the sampling of effluent streams, using 
methods required or recommended by regulatory agencies or authorities, 
where applicable. Chevron reports the total cumulative amount of oil 
discharged to surface water excluding spills, which are reported separately.
 36 Chevron reports petroleum spills to land and water to conform to the 2020 
Ipieca Reporting Guidance. Spills to land and water that are greater than or 
equal to one barrel are included. Spills to secondary containment, chemical 
spills and spills due to sabotage are excluded.
 37 To conform to the 2015 and 2020 Ipieca Reporting Guidances, and where 
appropriate information and data exist, our hazardous waste numbers 
starting in 2015 exclude remediation waste generated; disposed of; and 
recycled, reused or recovered. Hazardous waste amounts are quantified 
using methods required or recommended by regulatory agencies or 
authorities, where applicable. In other instances, similar methods are 
used, including direct measurement onsite or at the point of shipping, 
engineering estimates and process knowledge. Chevron follows the 
regulatory definitions of hazardous waste applicable to the jurisdictions 
in which we operate, including de minimis specifications (below which 
hazardous waste quantities do not need to be reported).
 38 The 2021 data are based on information received from government entities 
and recorded internally as of April 7, 2022.
 39 Global employee diversity and U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) percentages have been rounded to the nearest  
whole number. Global data are as of December of the year identified. 
Although gender is not binary, gender is currently reported in binary 
(men, women) terms to align with U.S. government reporting regulations. 
Our most recently filed Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 is 
available for download at chevron.com/eeo-1. EEO-1/EEOC gender and 
ethnicity counts differ from those in the Global Employee Diversity table 
due to differences that may vary from other methodologies. For the Global 
Employee Diversity table, “gender data not available” means data were  
not collected or employee chose not to disclose, and service station 
employee data are not included unless specifically stated. 
 40 Ethnicities with representation of less than 2%, such as, but not limited to, 
Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Two or More Races.
 41 This is not a precise year-over-year comparison. For 2020, some but not  
all employees for whom gender data were not available were counted  
as men or women using visual identification in accordance with U.S. EEOC 
guidelines. For 2021, visual identification was not used and is only used  
in the U.S. EEOC Statistics table.
 42 Data collected for year 2021 on February 7, 2022. For year 2020,  
data collected as of February 24, 2021. For year 2019, data collected  
as of January 23, 2020. For years 2017–2018, data collected as  
of February 20, 2019.
 43 This section reflects Chevron data collected as of March 14, 2022. Health and 
safety performance rates include both injury and illness-related incidents.
 44 Serious injuries are injuries that result in significant disfigurement, or 
typically result in permanent or long-term impairment of an internal organ, 
body function or body part.
 45 Data include catastrophic and major incidents only, as defined in 
the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) Land

portfolio carbon intensity methodology note
introduction
The portfolio carbon intensity methodology is designed to 
facilitate carbon intensity accounting of a company’s portfolio. 
It uses a representative value chain that includes emissions 
associated with bringing products to market, including the 
Scope 3 emissions from their use. The PCI methodology 
facilitates transparency in calculations and data with  
information taken from financial statements and emissions 
disclosures. This approach enables comparison of companies 
that may participate in different parts of the value chain and  
the use of real data. 
Intent:  The PCI methodology provides a framework for 
transparent and consistent comparisons of the mix of energy 
products provided by a company, inclusive of elements of  
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The methodology is broadly 
applicable to oil and gas companies involved in exploration  
and production, refining, or marketing activities.
PCI definition:  Estimated energy-weighted average GHG 
emissions intensity from a simplified value chain from the 
production, refinement, distribution and end use of marketed 
energy products per unit of energy delivered.
Units:  Grams of carbon dioxide-equivalent GHG emissions 
per megajoule of energy delivered (g CO 2e/MJ) on a higher-
heating-value basis to align with prior frameworks on gas value 
chain emissions and with heating values commonly used in 
commercial contracts.†
Scope:  The PCI is calculated on an annual basis as the weighted-
average GHG intensity of energy delivered across gas, natural 
gas liquid (NGL), oil, biofuel, hydrogen and lower carbon power 
products. Carbon removals are deducted from total lifecycle 
emissions estimates.The following energy products ( i) are included in the  
PCI methodology:
•  Gas:  piped gas, LNG and third-party-traded volumes 
•  Natural gas liquids:  NGLs from Upstream, refining and third-
party-traded volumes 
•  Oil: crude oil, refined products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel,  
fuel oil and other petroleum products) and third-party-  
traded volumes 
•  Biofuels:  ethanol, renewable diesel, biodiesel, sustainable 
aviation fuel and renewable natural gas
•  Hydrogen:  gray hydrogen, blue hydrogen and green hydrogen 
that are externally marketed 
•  Lower carbon power:  external sales of wind, solar and 
geothermal power 
The following removals ( j) are included in the PCI methodology 
calculation:
•  Carbon capture, utilization and storage removes CO 2 either 
directly from the atmosphere or from streams that would be 
released to the atmosphere. It does not include CO 2 produced 
from naturally occurring reservoirs that is used for enhanced  
oil recovery.
•  High-quality offsets  include nature-based solutions.
For traditional hydrocarbon products (gas, NGL and oil), 
marketed volumes are based on the business segment 
(production, refined products or marketing) with the largest 
overall commodity volume, inclusive of all traded volumes.
Chemicals and other business lines that do not primarily supply 
energy products are excluded from this calculation.
†  Several prior product-intensity frameworks have used lower heating value for intensity calculations.

76Σ Σ
Σmethodology and data sources 
Traditional hydrocarbon products: The intent of the frame -
work is to capture value chain emissions associated with the 
maximum hydrocarbon product volume for a company among 
its production, refining and marketing activities.  For all products 
that a company produces or refines, the PCI methodology uses 
the company’s equity GHG emissions and corresponding GHG 
intensity. To estimate the emissions for marketed products that 
the company does not produce or refine, the PCI methodology 
uses industry-average segment factors from the International 
Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook. Hydrocarbon transporta -
tion emissions are estimated in the PCI using IEA World Energy 
Outlook estimates for transportation emissions from oil and  
gas. Emissions associated with end use of marketed products 
are based on industry-standard combustion factors and assume 
all sold energy products are combusted, although this is not  
the case (e.g., plastics and lubricants). The graphic on page 78  
is a depiction of the value chain approach for the refined-
product value chain. 
Biofuels, hydrogen and lower carbon power: GHG emissions 
are calculated based on third-party lifecycle assessments 
and the energy provided by Chevron in the most recent year. 
Lifecycle assessment data sources include California Air 
Resources Board (CARB) Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) 
Pathway Certified Carbon Intensities for similar feedstocks and 
pathways, a Hydrogen Council report on a lifecycle assessment 
for hydrogen decarbonization pathways, and harmonized 
lifecycle assessments of electricity generation from the National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Intergovernmental  
Panel on Climate Change Working Group 1.
The model does not adjust for the energy efficiency gains 
associated with some applications of electricity and hydrogen 
relative to existing hydrocarbon infrastructure. For example, 
CARB estimates that energy provided as electricity to an electric 
vehicle is 3.4 times more efficient than energy provided by 
gasoline to an internal combustion engine. Model updates could 
be made in the future, if supported by the end use of electricity 
or hydrogen products. Inputs are collected from financial disclosures and public  
GHG reporting, with the exception of the biofuels component. 
Biofuel volumes are based on purchase data for ethanol, 
renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and biodiesel and 
production volumes for renewable natural gas in the United 
States, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Australia. 
Volumes from international GS Caltex operations in South  
Korea are assumed to be zero. For 2016–2021, aggregate  
biofuel volumes used in the PCI calculation are 60,000, 61,000,  
62,000, 68,000, 61,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil-equivalent  
per day, respectively. Biofuel carbon intensity values are based 
on CARB LCFS default pathway values. For 2016–2021, the 
weighted-average biofuel carbon intensity values used in the 
PCI calculation were 52, 52, 51, 50, 48 and 47 grams carbon 
dioxide-equivalent GHG emissions per megajoule, respectively.
CCUS: Net GHG removal emissions associated with CCUS 
represent the volume of emissions that would be permanently 
sequestered underground or utilized in other products  
with a deduction for supply chain emissions associated with  
capture, transport or storage. CCUS projects that reduce  
Scope 1 and 2 emissions would reduce the production, refining  
or other sectoral intensity and would not be double-counted  
as removals; for example, CO2 captured by an integrated CCS  
plant would already be accounted for in the facility’s Scope 1 
emissions intensity. 
Offsets: Offsets that are retired by the company or on behalf 
of customers for use of product provided by the company are 
deducted from the total emissions in the metric. 
Improvements over time: Methodologies and emissions factors 
may be updated in future years to reflect additional information 
or data that become available. For example, updates may 
include updated industry averages, primary data from third-
party producers/refiners and adjustments to energy efficiency 
assumptions, if warranted, based on the end-use applications  
for volumes of energy marketed by the company.portfolio carbon intensity methodology note, cont.equations, cont.

Emissions reported are net (Scope 1 and 2). The emissions included in the metrics generally represent Chevron’s equity share of emissions from Upstream, including LNG, which  
are emissions from operated and nonoperated joint-venture assets based on Chevron’s financial interest. For reporting, Chevron includes indirect sources of GHG emissions  
within Scope 1 that are outside of the traditional Scope 1 definition, such as GHG emissions from processes like drilling and completions, and tolling agreements up to the point  
of third-party custody transfer of the oil or gas product. For oil and gas production intensity metrics, production is aligned with net production values reported in the Chevron 
Corporation Supplement to the Annual Report, which represent the company’s equity share of total production after deducting both royalties paid to landowners and a 
government’s agreed-upon share of production under a Production Sharing Agreement. Chevron’s equity-share emissions include emissions associated with these excluded 
royalty barrels in accordance with Ipieca guidance. Also in accordance with Ipieca guidance, Chevron’s equity-share emissions do not include emissions associated with royalty 
payments received by the company. Allocation of emissions between oil and gas is based on the fraction of production represented by liquids or gas. Flaring and methane 
intensities use the total of liquids and gas production. Oil and gas production intensities use liquids production and natural gas production, respectively.
refining carbon intensity , kilograms CO 2e/boe  
The refining carbon intensity (RCI) metric provides a measure of GHG released during the

*  Emissions from third-party processing of imported feedstocks are estimated using information including supplier data, industry segment averages and engineering estimates. 
Emissions included in the calculation represent refinery processing only and do not include terminals or chemical, additive, base oil and lubricant facilities not integrated  
into a refinery. Feedstocks include hydrogen and intermediate products that will be further refined or used in conversion units. Feedstocks do not include natural gas used  
as fuel or products intended solely for blending into finished products. Feedstocks are assessed on a net basis (imports minus exports). 
†  Emissions associated with the production of hydrogen can account for 25% of total refinery emissions, and more than half of the hydrogen used in U.S. refining is imported  
from a third party. (“Available and emerging technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the petroleum refinery industry,” US EPA Office of Air and Radiation

 i [(GHG intensity fossil fuel  – GHG intensity i) * (Energy) i ] +  j(Net GHG removals) j
Where: (GHG Intensity) fossil fuel  is the average intensity of displaced fossil fuel that is calculated in  
the PCI methodology, (GHG intensity) i is the simplified lifecycle GHG intensity of energy product i,  
(Energy) i is the energy of the marketed low-carbon product i (e.g., biofuels, hydrogen), and  
(Net GHG removals) j is the net volume of GHG emissions stored.
Enabled emissions reductions are the estimated avoided 
emissions relative to fossil fuel use primarily associated  
with biofuels, hydrogen, CCUS and offsets that the company  
has marketed in the most recent calendar year, regardless  
of whether the company retained rights to the emissions 
reduction attributes. 
Over time, new energy products may be added to the calcu -
lation, along with associated volume information. Avoided 
emissions associated with natural gas-fired power generation  
via co-generation or coal-fired power generation displacement 
are excluded from this calculation for purposes of simplicity. For biofuels and hydrogen products, the enabled emissions 
reductions are calculated based on the lifecycle GHG savings 
relative to the same amount of energy provided by diesel 
fuel. Where appropriate, energy efficiency factors are used to 
calculate the volumes of displaced fossil fuels. More details on 
emissions factors and calculation assumptions are available in 
the PCI methodology note (see pages 76–78 ).
Net GHG removal emissions associated with CCUS and offsets 
represent the volume of emissions that would be sequestered 
or utilized in other products. GHG emissions associated with 
CCUS or offset value chains would be netted from the reductions 
associated with the activity. enabled emissions reductions methodology noteequations, cont.

80Σ ΣThis report contains forward-looking statements relating  
to Chevron’s operations and energy transition plans that are 
based on management’s current expectations, estimates  
and projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other 
energy-related industries. These statements are not guarantees 
of future conduct or policy and are subject to certain risks, 
uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the 
company’s control, including government regulation and oil  
and gas prices. See Forward-Looking Statements Warning  
on page 75  of this report.
This report covers our owned and operated businesses and  
does not address the performance or operations of our suppliers, 
contractors and partners unless otherwise noted. In the case  
of certain joint ventures for which Chevron is the operator, we  
exercise influence but not control. Thus, the governance, proc -
esses, management and strategy for those joint ventures are 
known to differ from those detailed in this report. All financial 
information is presented in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
Therefore, the actual conduct of our activities, including the 
development, implementation or continuation of any program, 
policy or initiative discussed or forecasted in this report, 
may differ materially in the future. As with any projections or 
estimates, actual results or numbers may vary. Many of the 
standards and metrics used in preparing this report continue 
to evolve and are based on management assumptions believed 
to be reasonable at the time of preparation but should not be 
considered guarantees. The statements of intention in this report 
speak only as of the date of this report. Chevron undertakes  
no obligation to update publicly any statements in this report.
This report contains information from third parties, such as 
the World Resources Institute and IEA. Chevron makes no 
representation or warranty as to the third-party information. 
Where necessary, Chevron received permission to cite third-
party sources, but the information and data remain under the 
control and direction of the third parties. Where Chevron has 
used information, it has noted the source. This report contains 
terms used by Ipieca and SASB, as well as information about how 
the disclosures in this report align with the recom  mend  ations 
of Ipieca and SASB. In doing so, Chevron does not intend to 
endorse or adopt and is not endorsing or adopting these phrases 
or recommendations. In using these terms and referencing the 
recommendations, Chevron is not obligating itself to use the 
terms in the way defined by Ipieca and SASB, nor is it obligating 
itself to comply with any specific recommendations or to provide 
any specific disclosure. Chevron makes no representation or  
about this report
warranty as to Ipieca or SASB’s use or definition of specific terms 
or recommendations. For example, with respect to the use of  
the term material , individual companies are best suited to deter -
mine what information is material , under the long-standing U.S. 
Supreme Court definition of that term, and whether to disclose 
this information in U.S. Securities and Exchange financial filings.
As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as  
“the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “its,” “we” and “us” 
may refer to one or more of Chevron’s consolidated subsidiaries 
or affiliates or to all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated 
otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron – i.e., those 
companies generally owned 50 percent or less. All of these terms 
are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise 
description of any of the separate companies, each of which 
manages its own affairs.
Further, as used in this report, the term “project” may describe 
new Upstream development activity, including phases in a  
multi  phase development, maintenance activities, certain existing 
assets, new investments in Downstream & Chemicals capacity, 
investment in emerging and lower carbon intensity activities,  
and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for  
con venience only and are not intended as a precise description  
of the term “project” as it relates to any specific government  
law or regulation. In addition, for Chevron, “lower carbon energy” 
includes a variety of existing and emerging energy solutions 
and services, including traditional energy sources linked with 
renewables or abatement technologies or measures, carbon 
capture and sequestration, offsets, blue and green hydrogen, 
geothermal, and nuclear.
