Letter from Our  
Chairman & CEO
At Visa, we work every day to connect the world to 
enable individuals, businesses and economies to 
thrive, and we are committed to doing so in a way  
that supports both inclusive and sustainable growth  
to improve people’s lives and drive economic and 
societal progress.
I am pleased to share with you Visa’s annual Corporate 
Responsibility & Sustainability Report, which details 
our commitments and progress as an inclusive, 
responsible, ethical and sustainable corporate citizen 
across four key areas:
  Empowering People and Economies  by supporting 
micro and small businesses, expanding financial access 
to the unbanked and underserved, building financial 
capability and strengthening our communities   Securing Commerce and Protecting Customers  
through an evolving and multi-layered approach 
that enables reliable, trustworthy and frictionless 
digital payment experiences
  Investing in Our Workforce  by developing our 
world-class talent, fostering a diverse and inclusive 
culture and offering training and benefits that 
support our employees’ success
  Operating Sustainably and Responsibly  
through advancing environmental sustainability  
and upholding the highest standards for integrity, 
compliance and corporate governance
As Visa celebrated our 60th anniversary and 10 years  
as a publicly-traded company, we also marked a year 
of continued progress toward our goals across these 
four areas, including the following highlights:
Empowering
Expanded our financial empowerment focus on micro 
and small businesses, implemented programs including 
She’s Next, Money Is Changing and Visa Everywhere 
Women’s Edition and helped unbanked individuals 
access electronic payments accounts — now reaching 
396 million toward our goal of 500 million by 2020
Securing
Evolved our industry-leading security capabilities, 
expanded Visa Token Service and opened a new  
Cyber Fusion Center in London to strengthen our 
global capability to rapidly collect, analyze and 
leverage cyber threat intelligence information
Investing
Expanded Visa University, our signature global  
learning platform, launched a world-class online and 
in-person inclusion training program and created a 
Gender Inclusion Council of 20 Visa leaders to create  
a more inclusive working environment Operating
Committed to transition to 100% renewable electricity 
by 2020, reduced our greenhouse gas emissions year 
over year for the second consecutive year, implemented 
the Visa Supplier Code of Conduct, expanded our 
Supplier Diversity program and became a founding 
supporter of the Centre for Sport and Human Rights
I am particularly proud of the growing third-party 
recognition we continue to receive for our 
environmental, social and governance performance. 
Visa was once again named to the Dow Jones 
Sustainability North American Index and the 
FTSE4Good Index in 2018. We also were listed as one 
of Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies for the 
seventh consecutive year and included as members  
of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens and 100 Most JUST 
Companies rankings — among other recognitions.
I invite you to read our latest Corporate Responsibility 
& Sustainability report, and hope you enjoy exploring 
how Visa is helping create thriving economies, strong 
communities and a healthy planet.
Sincerely, 
Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Business for Social Responsibility, Centre for Sport and 
Human Rights, Corporate Eco Forum, Chief Executives

Materiality * 
To inform our corporate responsibility and sustainability 
strategy, Visa maintains ongoing engagement with 
various stakeholder groups, including shareholders, 
clients, third-party environmental, social and  
governance (ESG) organizations and interest groups.  
In addition, we conduct formal ESG materiality  
assessments on a biennial basis to identify the topics 
most relevant to Visa and our external stakeholders.  
We organize and calibrate our corporate responsibility 
and sustainability strategy around these topics. In 
2019, we will conduct our next materiality assessment 
to ensure our strategy continues to align with our  
stakeholders’ evolving priorities and expectations and 
Visa’s long-term success. Read more about our most 
recent materiality assessments in our 2016 Corporate 
Responsibility Report . 
*  In this report, our use of the terms “material,” “materiality” and other similar 
terms refers to topics that reflect Visa’s significant economic, social and 
environmental impacts or that substantially influence the assessments and 
decisions of a diverse set of stakeholders. We are not using these terms as 
they are used under the securities or other laws of the United States or any 
other jurisdiction or as these terms are used in the context of financial

Responsibility & Sustainability
At Visa, ongoing corporate responsibility and

level across our strategic and operational areas,  
with executive and Board oversight. 
Visa’s Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 
Leadership Council serves as the central coordinating 
body facilitating our corporate responsibility  
and sustainability strategy and reporting efforts.  
The Leadership Council is co-chaired by our Vice 
President — Head of Corporate Responsibility and 
Sustainability and our Chief Counsel — Corporate,  
with cross-functional representation from more  
than a dozen senior leaders. 
Since 2016, the Nominating and Corporate  
Governance Committee of the Visa Board of Directors 
has had formal responsibility for and oversight of 
corporate responsibility and sustainability policies, 
programs and reporting. The full Board receives 
quarterly updates on Visa’s ongoing ESG activities,  
as well as information about ESG trends and events. 
Visa’s governance of specific ESG topics is spread 
among our Board committees as follows: Audit & Risk Committee

8910Supporting the United  
Nations Sustainable  
Development Goals
The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) provide a shared blueprint for governments, 
businesses and civil society organizations to address the 
most pressing environmental and social issues facing 
our world today. 
At Visa we are committed to addressing these 
sustainable development challenges — helping to 
create thriving economies and a thriving planet. In 2017, 
we conducted a robust analysis of our impact on the 
SDGs and found that we contribute most to Goal 8, 
Decent Work and Economic Growth and Goal 5, Gender 
Equality. As a leading global payments technology 
company, we secondarily contribute to at least six 
other SDGs. We also support the SDGs in other ways, 
including serving on the Corporate Action Group  
for Reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals, 
convened by the Global Reporting Initiative and the 
UN Global Compact. We are taking action to address 
these goals in a variety of ways:

Visa envisions a world where all

able to use secure, convenient 
and affordable payment and 
other financial services to help 
meet daily needs, long-term 
goals and to thrive. We are 
proud of our history of 
contributing to the growth of 
worldwide financial networks, 
implementing financial 
inclusion initiatives, providing 
free, award-winning financial 
literacy programs and using  
our time, talent and assets to 
strengthen local communities.

1213Financial Empowerment
We believe that an open and more connected world  
is one where consumers and businesses enjoy greater 
choice and flexibility. To create that world, we need to 
bridge the gap between those who have access to digital 
payments and those who do not. Also, we need to 
continue to eliminate points of friction that still exist 
for consumers and business — from how value is 
exchanged between individuals, between businesses 
and how workers are paid in the growing gig economy.
 
Financial empowerment is an important component 
of lifting individuals and communities out of poverty, 
yet access is not always distributed equitably. In response, 
we are focusing our business and philanthropic efforts 
on enabling the success of micro and small businesses 
(MSBs), particularly women-owned businesses. 
Financial empowerment is also closely tied to education, 
and financial literacy is essential if individuals and 
economies are to prosper. 
Connecting Commerce
Visa’s core business of providing simple, safe and 
frictionless payment experiences helps empower 
individuals and businesses around the world, including 
those in emerging economies and remote locations. 
We continue to enable payment products and services 
that expand access to the formal financial system, 
including the following:
Visa Direct
Visa Direct is a global capability that powers real-time 
payments and payouts backed by the security of 
VisaNet. Visa Direct allows merchants, governments  
and corporations to send fast direct payments to 
individuals instead of cash, check or ACH. Visa Direct 
also enables ride-share drivers to receive their wages 
daily, insurance payouts to be disbursed and delivery 
service representatives to be paid securely and in  
real time.* The capability is already used by partner 
companies to help millions of gig economy workers 
get paid quickly and conveniently.
QR Payments 
Our QR payment solution, scan-to-pay, is a low-cost 
acceptance solution for merchants, enabling the 
growth of digital payments in developing economies 
and remote locations. With scan-to-pay, a business 
needs only to display a QR code to accept digital 
payments, saving the cost, time and complexity of 
installing a terminal and telecommunications wiring. Scan-to-pay allows payments to be sent from a  
Visa prepaid, debit or credit card account by simply 
using a smartphone to scan a QR code displayed  
by the merchant. 
QR-based payments are growing in many parts of the 
world where reliable electricity supply or landline 
infrastructure are lacking. In 2018, we saw acceptance 
grow steadily to more than 700,000 scan-to-pay 
acceptance points in India, one of the largest countries 
adopting this technology. Scan-to-pay’s recent launches 
in Cambodia and Ghana, with a commercial launch 
planned for Tanzania in 2019, showcase that the solution 
is expanding in emerging markets of all sizes and regions.
* Actual fund availability varies by financial institution. Visa requires U.S. issuers 
to make funds available to its cardholders within a maximum of 30 minutes  
of approving the transaction.Prepaid Products 
Governments around the world are using Visa prepaid 
cards to deliver a wide range of social benefits, disaster 
relief, tax refunds, grants and scholarships, payroll, 
loans and other disbursements to recipients through 
digital payments. Visa prepaid cards have helped 
government agencies streamline payments by 
reducing processing and distribution costs related  
to payments via cash, checks and vouchers and by 
enhancing fraud mitigation. 
 
For example:
  In the Dominican Republic, the government is using 
Visa prepaid cards to transfer subsidies electronically 
to more than 900,000 beneficiaries through its Social 
Subsidies Payment System (SPSS).   In Egypt, Visa is partnering with the government  
to promote financial inclusion and transition away 
from cash by disbursing wages, social welfare and 
pensions on Visa prepaid cards. 
  In the U.S., 37 states, the District of Columbia and  
the federal government disburse funds to recipients 
with Visa prepaid cards, including child support 
payments, unemployment insurance benefits, 
workers’ compensation, temporary assistance for 
needy families (TANF), tax refunds and payroll. 
Small Business Solutions 
Small businesses are the backbone of local economies 
around the world, representing up to 70% of total 
global employment. Yet half of small businesses fail 
after five years due to difficulties with obtaining 
funding, keeping sound financial records and 
maintaining new office equipment. Visa is committed to helping small businesses thrive 
and grow by delivering services, products and 
programs that help with the following activities: 
  Managing cash flow with credit, debit and prepaid 
cards, Authorize.net and Visa Direct
  Keeping their customers and themselves secure 
with POS chip-enabled payment terminals, and 
mobile-enabled tap-to-pay contactless payments
  Reducing costs with business-relevant discounts 
from Visa SavingsEdge
  Growing their business with Visa Commerce Network’s 
card-linked offers and exclusive advertising benefits 
from Yelp , along with online  and in-person educational 
and supportive resources and initiatives like She’s 
Next, Empowered by Visa 
Empowering Micro  
& Small Businesses
By helping micro and small businesses (MSBs) thrive, 
Visa works to help drive economic growth and improve 
the livelihoods of millions. We harness our capital, assets, 
people, knowledge and partnerships to empower 
MSBs by providing:
  Access to business and financial education, skills and 
support networks
  Affordable and appropriate financial services and 
access to markets to drive growth 
  Savings and other tools to support resilience when 
faced with unplanned circumstances  
Visa will deepen partnerships with clients, 
governments, fintechs, non-profits and other private 
sector leaders to help ensure that our programs 
produce tangible outcomes in improving livelihoods.
14Visa’s programs for empowering MSBs include  
the following: 
Practical Business Skills
For more than 25 years, Visa has partnered with 
governments, financial institutions, merchants, schools 
and NGOs to provide financial literacy programs around 
the world. Our programs include the new Practical 
Business Skills  for MSBs, an offering that provides 
educational resources and interactive tools to help 
business owners start, manage and grow their 
companies. During 2019 and beyond, we plan to scale 
these programs globally through clients, non-profits 
and government partners.
Programs and Partnerships
We collaborate with other organizations to promote 
economic inclusion and access to financial services for 
MSBs across the globe. The following examples showcase 
key partnerships of 2018 and early 2019:
  Côte d’Ivoire: Visa is partnering with the national 
government to advance its economic, financial 
system and development goals by supporting the 
digitization of payments in cocoa and cashew value 
chains, transportation, government wages and the 
postal service, together with financial literacy training. 
  India: Visa and TechnoServe, a global nonprofit,  
are working together to improve the livelihoods of 
female farmers by increasing their participation in 
agricultural value chains while improving agronomy 
and business skills. As a result of the pilot, women 
are transforming their roles at home, in businesses 
and in farming cooperatives by assuming leadership 
roles. Over 18 months, farming cooperatives 
increased revenue by 313 percent, farmer revenue 
increased by 30 percent, female board members in 
cooperatives increased by 167 percent and female 
shareholders by more than eight times.   Mexico: Visa is collaborating with Fundes, a  
nonprofit in Latin America, to develop and test Enko,  
a capacity-building program, to help micro and 
small business owners improve their business 
management skills. During the pilot period, which 
concluded in 2018, nearly 4,000 business owners 
across five sectors accessed the training platform 
free of charge. The training platform boosts skills 
across 32 modules with subjects including marketing, 
management, finance and retirement planning. 
Empowering Unbanked  
& Underserved Consumers
Around the world, 1.7 billion people remain excluded 
from the formal financial system and from the tools 
and services that help them smooth cash flow, save for 
life goals and manage unexpected events. Visa has a 
significant opportunity to advance financial inclusion, 
improve the lives of millions of people and strengthen 
economies around the world. 
In 2015, Visa committed to provide access to 500 million 
previously unbanked or underserved people by 2020 
through a Visa branded payment account, in support  
of the World Bank’s goal of Universal Financial Access. 
Since then, 396 million consumers worldwide received 
first-time access to digital payment products through 
Visa, with more than 115 million in 2018 alone. Of the 396 
million, more than half are women, 33 percent are rural 
residents and 36 percent are lower-income individuals. 
Visa aims to achieve these goals by tailoring our core 
business lines to meet local market needs and by 
creating commercial and philanthropic partnerships 
that maximize the impact of digital financial services 
and the global reach of our payments network.Practical Money Skills

15 Empowering Women
Visa is committed to promoting gender equality and empowering 
women within our organization and across the globe. Despite their 
contribution to both the formal and informal economy worldwide, 
women-owned MSBs are unserved or underserved financially. Financial 
products such as savings, credit and insurance help low-income  
women build their assets, grow their businesses and ensure economic  
resilience in challenging times. When woman-owned MSBs thrive,  
their owners’ livelihoods improve and they reinvest in their families and 
communities — creating a ripple effect of long-term, inter-generational 
change: education for their children, better housing and healthcare  
for themselves and their families. 
Women’s World Banking
Visa is proud to support the Visa Foundation, which made its inaugural grant of up to $20 million to Women’s 
World Banking in 2017. Through this five-year initiative, Women’s World Banking will financially empower 
women-led MSBs around the globe. In the first year, WWB launched a Leadership and Gender Diversity 
Program for central bankers and financial policymakers in conjunction with the Oxford University and the 
Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI). The program seeks to promote more gender positive policies across 
dozens of countries. WWB also completed research in Nigeria and Egypt and tested savings solutions  
in Mexico and India, that will be offered starting in 2019. 
She’s Next
Visa launched She’s Next, Empowered by Visa, as part of our ongoing commitment to support female 
entrepreneurs. In partnership with the Female Founder Collective, She’s Next helps female small business 
owners by creating convenient and secure digital payment methods, providing key research findings and 
offering unique small business credit/debit cards. Through the program, we help female entrepreneurs  
build a seamless customer experience, manage their finances and grow their businesses.

Visa launched the Money is Changing program to understand the shifting social norms related to personal 
finance and empower women to embrace a new conversation about money. Our research has found that 
women today approach finances in a way that differs significantly from the attitudes of past generations.  
In response to these trends, Visa is creating resources to help women learn from each other to make 
personalized and informed financial decisions.
Financial Literacy
Visa is proud to provide free and accessible financial 
education that helps empower people to better manage 
their money and improve their quality of life. 
Our award-winning flagship program, Practical Money 
Skills, provides parents, teachers, students and consumers 
with free financial literacy tools and resources for every 
stage of their lives, including: 
  Lesson plans for teachers and activities for students 
in pre-K through college, as well as the interactive 
“Your Money, Your Future” program
  Personal finance videos and articles that are available 
on mobile devices and via social media to inform 
both teenagers and adults about the benefits of 
managing their personal finances wisely and provide 
tools for them to do so
  Games that make financial literacy education fun, 
including an updated version of Financial Football 
and our new game, “The Payoff,” which focuses on 
behavioral change
  Tools and resources for adults, such as personal 
finance basics and budget calculators 
During 2019 and beyond, we plan to work with Visa’s 
priority merchants, clients, non-profits and government 
partners to scale Practical Money Skills and other 
Financial Literacy programs. 
Notable Highlights in 2018 include:
  Turkey: Visa’s “I Can Manage My Money” financial 
education program reached nearly 500,000 
individuals across the country with in-person 
trainings. Additionally, the program was selected  
as one of the best practices for an inclusive approach  
for delivering trainings to different disadvantaged 
1617segments, regardless of their education and 
socio-economic backgrounds across Turkey.  
The program team also presented at the G20 
conference in Argentina in December 2018. 
  United States: The JumpStart Coalition for Personal 
Financial Literacy presented Visa with an award  
for innovation, highlighting Financial Football and  
The Payoff.
  China: Visa launched a new mobile app called Fortune 
Teller, which educates consumers how to budget 
properly. The app is available China and Malaysia. 
Programs and Partnerships
Visa continues to develop programs and partnerships 
around the world to reach underserved and unbanked 
communities. And as part of our core business, we 
expanded payment systems to reach the financially 
excluded and help convert cash economies to  
digital economies.
  United States: Visa and the Filene Research Institute 
worked with 40 U.S. and Canadian credit unions to 
test financial products for minority communities. 
Products and programs tested included the following: 
credit access for immigrant households, small business 
microfinance, affordable auto loans using sophisticated 
data mining techniques and two alternative credit 
scoring models to help households avoid or transition 
out of high-cost payday loans. Combined, these 
programs resulted in loans of $85 million to 58,000 
households in 2016 and 2017. 
  Mexico: As of December 2018, the Visa-branded OXXO 
Saldazo account in Mexico reached 10 million 
customers, representing the first formal financial product 
for 42 percent of its users. This success is due in part 
to the ease of opening the account at the OXXO 
chain of 24/7 convenience stores and its low cost.   China: Through the NE Financial Inclusion 
Demonstration Zone program, Visa and its partners 
have helped more than 6 million rural, poor Chinese 
understand better how to use available financial 
services to improve their farming, herding and other 
income-generating activities, pay for goods and 
services more efficiently and avoid fraud. 
Community Support
At Visa, we use our time, talent and resources to 
strengthen communities in which we operate.  
Our approach to community support includes: 
 Community Giving
 Employee Community Involvement
 Humanitarian and Disaster Relief
Community Giving
In 2018, Visa and the Visa Foundation contributed to 
strengthening the markets and communities in which 
we operate, including the following examples across 
our primary regions:
Asia Pacific (AP) 
Visa’s philanthropic contributions in the Asia Pacific 
region spanned 14 countries, including notable 
support in Australia, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines 
and Vietnam, and focused on addressing local needs 
such as at-risk youth, underprivileged children’s health care and youth education. At our Singapore regional 
hub, we funded programs to alleviate hunger and 
support underserved families and women. Through a 
regional employee-directed charitable grant program, 
we supported charities offering skills-building workshops 
for women and migrant workers, technology-enhanced 
learning centers for children with disabilities and 
mentorship programs for students taking part in 
entrepreneurship programs. 
Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East  
and Africa (CEMEA) 
In our CEMEA region in 2018, Visa contributed to 
philanthropic causes in 7 markets, including Nigeria, 
Russia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Ukraine 
and others. Our efforts supported children with 
disabilities, food programs and youth education.  
In Ukraine, for example, Visa partnered with UNICEF  
and with our merchant clients to run two national 
charity campaigns. In Russia, Visa’s community 
involvement included contributions to Downside Up, 
which supports children with Down syndrome, and  
to the Volunteers to Help Orphans charitable fund. 
Europe 
In 2018, Visa worked to strengthen communities in 
Europe, including in France, Greece, Italy, Spain and  
the United Kingdom. For example, Visa partnered with 
Junior Achievement Europe to provide educational 
programs for entrepreneurship, work readiness and 
financial literacy in France, Italy and Spain. Visa also 
contributed to numerous organizations for community 
and humanitarian support in Greece. 
The Visa Foundation helps empower low-income, financially 
underserved micro and small businesses around the world, 
creating a ripple of impact throughout communities. 18Latin America 
In Latin America, Visa’s philanthropic efforts in 2018 
focused on supporting six markets, including Brazil, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru.  
We helped fund programs focused on education, 
health care, environmental protection and women’s 
advancement. Through our Latin America regional hub 
in Miami, we supported organizations serving youth, 
including St Jude Children’s Research Hospital and 
HISPA, an organization that provides educational 
programming for local underserved Hispanic students. 
Our 2018 community partners in Latin American 
markets included: Associação de Educação Financeira 
do Brasil, Fundación A la Rueda Rueda (Colombia), 
Bécalos and Quiera Fundación (Mexico) and 
Laboratoria Peru. Visa cardholders in Brazil can 
participate in the “Causas” charitable giving program. 
For every transaction made with a card enrolled in  
the program, Visa donates one cent of Real to an 
institution or cause selected by the cardholder.
North America 
Visa provides philanthropic support to programs 
across the United States and Canada to strengthen 
local communities. In the United States, our approach 
first includes our communities with significant employee 
presence. In the U.S., Visa contributed to organizations 
working to support children’s health, veterans, 
underserved youth and homeless services through 
partners such as Hero Homes in Northern Virginia, 
Central Texas Food Bank in Austin and Boys & Girls Clubs 
and Tipping Point in San Francisco. In Canada, Visa’s 
community support included Toronto Children’s Care 
and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada. Beyond our 
immediate local office communities, we joined with 
many of our clients and partners to contribute to more 
than 50 additional community organizations, including 
partners such as Back on My Feet, Children’s Miracle 
Network, Junior Achievement, National Women’s Law 
Center, Refugees International and Share Our Strength. Employee Community  
Involvement
We complement our corporate contributions by 
engaging our employees around the world to give 
back to their local communities through donations  
of time, talent and funds. We empower our employees 
to get involved in causes important to them through 
various mechanisms, including: 
  Matching Gifts: matching employees’ personal 
donations up to US $10,000 per year
  Volunteer Time Off (VTO): up to two days VTO  
per eligible employee
  Team Volunteer Events: Visa-organized team 
volunteer opportunities
  Employee Volunteer Councils: leadership 
development opportunities
In 2018, we introduced our Dollars for Doers offering, 
which provides employees with $10 per hour for 
volunteering — up to a total of $500 per year — to 
donate to the eligible charity of their choice. Humanitarian & Disaster Relief
When disasters strike, Visa and the Visa Foundation 
respond with support for impacted communities 
through relief, volunteering and recovery efforts.  
We provide immediate relief and long-term assistance 
through grants, double-matching of employee 
donations and, when appropriate, waiving our fees  
and interchange on consumer cardholder donations  
in consultation with our clients. 
In 2018, Visa and the Visa Foundation provided financial 
support to the recovery efforts after Hurricane Florence 
and Hurricane Michael in the U.S. and Typhoon Mangkhut 
in the Philippines. We also activated a two-to-one 
match of employee donations and leveraged our 
sponsorship of the NFL to create an online campaign 
to support relief efforts. In addition, our humanitarian 
relief efforts supported those affected by wildfires  
in California and Greece, earthquakes in Indonesia and 
Taiwan, tsunamis and flooding in India and Indonesia 
and the volcanic eruption in Guatemala. 
Visa Back to Business Project
We developed the Visa Back to Business Project in  
2018 to help consumers locate and support small 
businesses that are operating in areas hit by natural 
disasters. By identifying successfully processed Visa 
transactions in the disaster area, the Visa Back to 
Business Project website provides consumers with  
a list of open businesses to support. Giving & Volunteering Snapshot

Employee Generosity  
Shines on #GivingTuesday
In 2018, Visa participated in the annual 
#GivingTuesday global event by offering double 
matching of employees’ charitable donations on 
that day. More than 1,000 employees participated 
and donated more than $1 million to 1,300 
organizations, with Visa providing more than  
$2 million in matching funds. Participation in 
2018 was more than 29 times greater than in 
2017. With their generosity and commitment, 
Visa employees proved that together, we are  
a stronger force for good. 
1920Securing 
Commerce  
& Protecting 
Customers
Connecting the world begins 
with our commitment to 
protect payments security, 
consumer privacy and 
transaction integrity. Visa 
employs an evolving and  
multi-layered approach  
to help protect the digital 
payments system and  
its users and to safeguard  
our network. 
SDG 17
SDG 8
20Payments Security
As of the end of 2018, the Visa network had enabled 
more than 3.3 billion card credentials that were 
available to be used at nearly 54 million merchant 
locations across the globe. Even as payment volume 
has exponentially increased, we have evolved our security 
capabilities to lower the global fraud rate to less than 
0.1 percent. In 2018, we continued on our mission to 
significantly reduce fraud, increase approval rates and 
reduce consumer friction. 
To succeed in this mission, we have implemented a 
security strategy that addresses the existing and 
emerging threats to data, transaction and infrastructure 
security, and that advances the security vision that  
we share with our ecosystem stakeholders. 
The key components of the strategy are to: 
  Empower the consumer with stronger authentication, 
fraud detection and consumer tools
  Invest in intelligence and technology to detect, 
prevent and eradicate threats and devalue data
  Set a governance process to protect customers’ data
  Promote a strategic vision, which is to be a catalyst 
for growth, enabling end-to-end risk solutions that 
increase approvals, reduce fraud and enhance the 
customer experience
We continued on our mission 
to significantly reduce fraud, 
increase approval rates and 
reduce consumer friction.Empower the Consumer
Visa’s security strategy starts with meeting the 
consumers’ needs for payment security, trust, reliability 
and convenience. To meet these needs, we employ, 
authentication, fraud detection and consumer tools  
to address vulnerabilities in the payments ecosystem. 
Consumer Tools
Consumers want to be in control. Through our 
financial institution clients, we provide consumers  
with the ability to manage their security settings, 
enabling them to set restrictions on card use and  
to customize card alerts through Transaction Controls. 
The alerts can allow cardholders to identify unauthorized 
charges before fraud losses occur. A global Visa  
study found that cardholder alerts can reduce fraud  
by up to 37 percent. 
Authentication
Thinking beyond the 16-digit card number, we use 
data such as biometrics and payment device type  
to validate the authenticity of a transaction without 
negatively affecting the consumer experience. 
Fraud Detection
Visa employs analytics to thwart potential fraud.  
Visa Advanced Authorization (VAA) uses machine 
learning to analyze payment fraud trends and to 
provide real-time risk scores for incoming transactions. 
Visa Risk Manager enables our financial institution 
clients to create customized, analytics-informed rules 
that deliver the optimal customer experience based  
on the financial institutions’ risk appetite and strategy. 
These capabilities prevented an estimated $25 billion 
in fraud-related losses in 2018–2019.*  
*The period specified here includes May 1, 2018–April 30, 2019.
2122Invest in Intelligence  
& Technology
The second layer of our security strategy involves 
investing in intelligence and technology to prevent, 
detect and eradicate threats to payment data and 
infrastructure. Securing payment data was fundamentally 
transformed with the introduction of the EMV®  
Chip, which allows for more secure transactions by 
producing a unique cryptogram for every single 
transaction, rather than using a static account number. 
Visa continues to build and invest in new technology 
to protect the payments ecosystem.

Next Gen Risk Tech/Tokenization
Protect Visa
TimeVisa works to devalue data by removing sensitive 
information from the ecosystem and making stolen 
data invalid via solutions like tokenization. 
  Tokenization — Tokens do not reveal account 
details, such as the 16-digit account number, so  
they have less value if stolen or intercepted during  
a transaction. We predict that tokenization will be  
the “Chip for the Internet,” driving similar fraud 
reductions in digital commerce that chip cards have 
been able to achieve in the physical commerce 
space. Tokens can also be safely stored by online 
merchants or on mobile devices to facilitate 
e-commerce and mobile payments. In 2018, we 
expanded Visa Token Service (VTS) to devalue  
data in 40 markets around the world.  
We are able to harness data by identifying potential 
fraud before it occurs via capabilities like Vital Signs 
and eCommerce Threat Disruption. 
  Vital Signs actively monitors for and helps prevent 
fraudulent ATM cash-out attempts for all VisaNet 
clients. ATM cash-outs occur when criminals 
simultaneously conduct withdrawals at multiple 
ATMs. Our goal is to evolve Vital Signs to better 
detect broader patterns of suspicious behavior 
based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine 
Learning, and to look for emerging methods of 
fraudulent attacks before significant losses result. 
  eCommerce Threat Disruption (eTD) works by 
proactively scanning websites for malicious 
payment malware. In a recent case, eTD detected  
a compromise that affected multiple online service 
providers and potentially saved as much as  
$141 million before fraud could occur. Set a Governance Process
As industry leaders, we build and maintain trust  
via a set of standards, processes and rules that  
apply across the payments ecosystem. We are 
continuously evaluating our partnership programs 
with our clients — issuers, merchants and  
acquirers — to ensure we are all working together  
to protect consumers’ data. 
Promote a Strategic Vision
The emergence of new technologies, new participants 
and new ways of transacting (for example, via new 
types of mobile devices) presents a unique set of 
security challenges that we must manage. The final 
layer of our strategy recognizes that establishing  
a strategic vision will be key to adapting in this 
environment. At Visa, we believe that security is  
a catalyst for growth, responsible innovation and 
enhanced convenience.

Empower consumers and clients23Cybersecurity at Visa
In parallel with our role in advancing the security of  
the broader payments ecosystem, Visa also remains 
committed to championing cybersecurity within our 
walls. Approximately 5 percent of our workforce is 
dedicated to cybersecurity. Our multifaceted security 
approach empowers our employees to deploy security 
solutions that help keep our clients and consumers 
safe, while providing solutions that make Visa the best 
way to pay and be paid. 
We invest significantly in our comprehensive  
approach to cybersecurity at Visa, including through 
the following elements:
Strategy 
We execute a cybersecurity strategy approved by 
executive management and reviewed by the Board  
of Directors. The strategy unifies and drives action 
across information security program areas to protect 
Visa from data breaches and maintain trust in the 
payments ecosystem. 
Policy
Visa supports implementation of various privacy 
regulations and maintains and regularly reviews 
policies to protect information assets and consumer 
nonpublic personal information.
Visa’s cybersecurity policy, the Key Controls, provides  
a strong foundation for protection of our information 
assets and consumer nonpublic personal information 
(NPI). The Key Controls also support compliance  with external reviews and regulatory requirements, 
including the Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standard (PCI DSS), Statement on Standards for 
Attestation Engagements (SSAE-18), Sarbanes-Oxley 
(SOX 404), Payment Card Industry Personal Identification 
Number (PCI PIN), Webtrust, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act (GLBA), the European Union (EU) General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and examination by the 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). 
Audit
To ensure quality of our security systems, we conduct 
annual internal and external audits of our IT infrastructure 
and applications to evaluate current performance and 
risk reduction measures against industry standards. 
These assessments have consistently confirmed Visa’s 
security posture as stable and mature while helping 
Visa identify key risks and improvement opportunities.
Technical Controls
Visa deploys state-of-the-art security technologies  
to protect against data confidentiality, integrity and 
availability risks, emphasizing core cybersecurity 
capabilities to minimize risk exposure. 
We are continuously focused on enhancing our 
defense-in-depth security approach, which applies 
multiple layers of protection to reduce the risk of  
any single control failing. These measures include  
the following:
  A formal program to devalue sensitive and/or 
personal data through various cryptographic means 
  Embedded security in the software  
development lifecycle  Identity and access management controls to  
protect against unauthorized access 
  Development of advanced cyber detection  
and response capabilities
For example, Visa uses AI and deep learning technology 
to monitor our network and understand the threats 
aimed at our company. Our platform collects billions  
of security logs each day, providing insight across the 
network and within our infrastructure. We combine 
this data with external intelligence on attacks observed 
outside of our data centers and network. Using machine 
learning tools, we focus on the events that appear to 
pose a risk, enabling our cybersecurity team to intervene. 
We operate this platform globally, with teams in 
multiple time zones detecting and responding 24x7x365. 
In addition, to address external risks and nontechnical 
aspects of security, we mandate that third parties 
maintain an adequate data security posture, as well as 
account for the human factors that influence security 
though extensive and regular security awareness training 
for our employees and contingent workers. 
Response & Resilience
Our advanced defensive capabilities — which include 
monitoring, detection, response, intelligence and 
investigation — are complemented by internal processes 
and policies designed to ensure resiliency in the event 
of a cyberattack affecting Visa or a third party. 
To continually maintain and improve the effectiveness 
of our resiliency capabilities, we place enhanced focus 
on third-party resiliency and communication protocols 
and regularly conduct cross-functional exercises that 
involve multiple response and recovery teams, as well 
as external partners and agencies. 24Oversight
Our cybersecurity approach is supported by robust 
governance processes, which involve regular reporting 
to the management- and Board-level committees 
responsible for risk management and oversight of 
cybersecurity. Frequent reporting is conducted by  
the Executive Vice President, Technology and Operations, 
and the Senior Vice President, Chief Information 
Security Officer. 
Collaboration
We are strengthening and expanding our global 
capabilities through Visa’s Cyber Fusion Framework  
to rapidly collect, analyze and leverage cyber threat 
intelligence information flow internally from private 
and public sector partners. The bidirectional flow  
of information that results from Visa’s private and 
public sector partnerships is an important source of 
threat intelligence. It is vital to our efforts to stop 
cyberattacks targeting Visa and consumer payment 
information across the payments ecosystem. In 2018, 
we opened a new Cyber Fusion Center in London, 
adding to our existing Center in the eastern U.S. 
We continuously work to protect our data and systems 
from various and evolving cybersecurity threats, including 
advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, phishing and 
social engineering schemes.
In 2018, we focused on building internal capabilities  
to reduce dependence on vendors and ensure faster 
development of security solutions. We are empowering 
and equipping developers across Visa to embrace a 
“Shift Left” mentality (resolving issues earlier in the 
software development lifecycle) to continually improve 
product security. Through these efforts, we are creating 
“Security Champions” across the organization. Consumer Privacy
Visa is committed to protecting the privacy and 
confidentiality of our stakeholders’ Personal 
Information. Visa’s Global Privacy Program, led by  
our Chief Privacy Officer, is designed to ensure that 
Personal Information is handled properly worldwide. 
Visa’s Corporate Risk Committee and the Audit and 
Risk Committee of the Board oversee the Global 
Privacy Program and risks related to data privacy, 
including compliance with well over 100 privacy  
and data protection laws, including the GDPR, the  
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and other data 
protection laws. 
Visa maintains a Global Privacy Policy to provide guidance 
to Visa staff worldwide on the privacy principles that 
apply to the handling of Personal Information in  
the course of Visa’s business operations. This Policy  
helps us comply with industry standards and applicable 
legal requirements. The Policy is supported by a set  
of privacy-related policies and procedures (including 
Visa’s Information Security Policy and Visa’s Records 
and Information Management Policy, among others) 
Visa’s Cybersecurity 
program received the 
highest rating among peer 
companies from Gartner 
Consulting during our 2019 
program review. that are aligned to global privacy legal and regulatory 
requirements, as well as best practices in the industry. 
The Policy applies to all Visa employees, agents, 
contractors and consultants. 
Visa strives to offer innovative products, services and 
solutions, and we appreciate that our ability to  
process Personal Information securely, only when 
necessary, is central to our mission. We consider 
privacy and security throughout our research and 
development processes. We use Privacy Impact 
Assessments and Privacy-by-Design methodologies  
to help identify and manage privacy risk. 
When we process personal information, we are 
committed to: 
Being Transparent
Our privacy notices explain what 
information we collect, how it 
may be used and whether it will 
be shared with third parties.
Protecting Information
We have in place robust systems  
to secure personal information 
entrusted to us.
Offering Choice
We offer consumers choices about 
our communications with them and 
use of their personal information.
Respecting Individual Rights
We provide mechanisms for 
consumers to access and update 
personal information as required  
by law.
25
In 2018, the EU adopted the GDPR to protect the data 
privacy of all individuals living within the European 
Economic Area (EEA). Visa established policies and 
processes required for the implementation of the 
Regulation, which became effective on May 25, 2018. 
The GDPR applies to all companies that process the 
personal data of people living in the European Union, 
regardless of where the company is located. The 
regulation also requires timely notice of data breaches, 
plain language applications for consent to use data 
and equally easy processes to withdraw consent and 
erase personal information. 
 
Visa took the following steps to address the 
requirements of the GDPR: 
  Enhanced and adjusted its privacy program and 
governance to follow the GDPR framework
  Created an inventory of all GDPR-compliant Personal 
Information held by Visa and how it is used
  Updated public-facing privacy notices  Adopted one global privacy policy that supports 
GDPR compliance
  Engaged with financial institution clients and others in 
the payment services ecosystem through a consistent, 
coordinated way that also will help them comply  
We are leveraging these processes to prepare for 
future regulation, such as the California Consumer 
Privacy Act (effective January 2020) and the Brazilian 
General Data Protection law (effective February 2020). 
We require all Visa employees to complete annual 
compliance training, including training on our Global 
Privacy Policy, as well as security awareness training. 
Additionally, we provide role-based training to staff 
with particular responsibility for personal information, 
such as those Visa employees who handle Individual 
Rights Requests directly from consumers.

Visa Privacy Center .Transaction Integrity
Visa is committed to ensuring the integrity of its payment 
system to maintain and enhance shareholder trust in 
Visa as the most secure way to pay. 
Visa’s Franchise Risk Management (FRM) programs 
focus on monitoring, detecting and preventing 
transactions that are illegal. FRM includes Visa’s Global 
Brand Protection Program, which manages situations 
where the Visa brand is associated with illegal 
activities. These include transactions such as: 
  Illegal Internet 
gambling
  Illicit pharmaceutical 
sales Child abuse images
  Abuse of intellectual 
property rights 
As part of this program, Visa is a supporter of the U.S. 
Financial Coalition Against Child Exploitation. The 
Coalition, sponsored and managed by the International 
Centre for Missing & Exploited Children and the  
U.S.‐based National Center for Missing & Exploited 
Children, combines the resources of the public and 
private sectors to severely disrupt and dismantle 
commercial child pornography. The Coalition’s goal  
is to eradicate the profitability of commercial child 
pornography by intercepting the flow of funds to and 
from these illegal enterprises. Visa also is a member of 
and has a strategic partnership with the International 
Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC), a Washington, 
D.C.-based non-profit organization devoted solely to 
combating product counterfeiting and piracy, which  
are seen by the organization as creating severe public 
health and safety hazards, as well as economic harm.Investing in  
Our Workforce
Visa’s mission to connect the 
world to enable businesses, 
economies and individuals to 
thrive is fueled by the talent, 
diversity and dedication of  
our employees. We invest in 
our employees’ career growth 
and development and foster 
an inclusive culture. We also 
provide comprehensive 
benefits and work to ensure 
employee safety. At Visa, we 
celebrate our employees’ 
unique life experiences, 
talents, passions and the 
contribution they can make  
to drive innovation in the 
payments technology industry.

26Employee Learning  
& Development 
Learning and development are critical components  
of Visa’s commitment to supporting our employees. 
Our programs cater to employees at every stage of 
their careers. 
We continue to scale our learning programs throughout 
the world. Led by our Chief Learning Officer, the Visa 
Learning organization is focused on developing our 
current and future workforce through educational 
programs in areas such as payments, diversity and 
inclusion and leadership. We encourage our employees’ 
development through a variety of mechanisms,  
including on-the-job training with managers, mentors 
and peers, classroom learning and self-directed learning. 
In 2018, 98 percent of Visa employees worldwide 
engaged in optional learning activities. We continue to use Visa University — our signature 
global learning platform — to equip our employees 
with the appropriate knowledge and skills to shape 
the future of commerce. With physical campuses in 
Foster City and Singapore, as well as a global digital 
campus, Visa University is now home to more than 
80,000 learning resources. Classes are often taught and 
facilitated by company executives and senior leaders 
who bring real-world context and ideas for practical 
application aligned with Visa’s goals. Visa University 
Faculty bring expertise in leadership, business context 
and understanding of Visa’s objectives to their teaching. 
Visa provides employees with additional development 
opportunities through our educational assistance 
program. The program grants up to $5,250 to full-time 
employees in good standing who wish to pursue 
continued education at an accredited college or 
university. Employees can continue to earn annual 
tuition assistance until they recover their full investment. At Visa, we believe maintaining our position as a 
leading payments network requires helping develop 
other participants of the broader payments ecosystem. 
We continue to offer educational opportunities to 
external partners through the Visa Business School  
and the Visa School of Public Policy. In 2018, we 
reached over 40,000 people around the world via 
these initiatives. 
Visa University — our 
signature global learning 
platform — features classes 
taught and facilitated by 
company leaders and is 
now home to more than 
80,000 learning resources.
Developing the Future Workforce
At Visa, we believe that a qualified workforce is critical to remaining competitive and have committed to numerous 
programs and partnerships that strengthen STEM skills and prepare current and future employees for success. Visa is one  
of 200 companies that signed the White House Pledge to America’s Workers  in 2018. Together, these companies have 
committed to expanding programs that educate, train and reskill American workers from high school age to those near 
retirement. The companies that have signed the pledge have promised to reach more than 6.5 million workers combined.
In addition, in early 2019, Visa CEO Al Kelly joined the newly created American Workforce Policy Advisory Board ,  
a 25-member advisory committee led by the White House and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Advisory Board 
membership includes private sector leaders, as well as experts from government, higher education, labor and business 
groups. The Board is advising the Administration on ways the private sector and educational institutions can collaborate 
to prepare the current and future workforce to fill jobs that demand increasing levels of digital skills. 
2728Employee Engagement
Dee Hock, Visa’s Founder and Chairman, once said  
that “an organization, no matter how well designed,  
is only as good as the people who live and work in it.”  
We continue to embody this belief and strive to inspire, 
motivate and empower our employees. We believe 
that an engaged workforce helps fuel our success. 
Our engagement approach centers on communication 
and recognition. We communicate with our employees 
in a variety of ways, including the company intranet 
editorial content, digital signage, live events in regional 
offices and quarterly all-staff meetings. Employees also 
have access to our enterprise social platform and our 
Go Beyond employee recognition program, which 
encourages recognition from both managers and peers 
and provides greater visibility for those being 
acknowledged. 72% of all employees have received  
a recognition since Go Beyond was introduced in  
2015, with a total of nearly 52,000 recognition notes 
sent in 2018 alone. 
We assess employee engagement by administering  
an annual Employee Survey, which invites employees 
to provide feedback on a variety of topics, including 
company direction and strategy, individual growth and 
development, tools and processes and collaboration. 
In 2018, 95 percent of employees responded to the 
Survey. Overall, scores increased in 44 of 49 total

In response to employee feedback, we continue to 
seek out improvement opportunities in several areas 
of focus, including recognition and process efficiency. 
Following the Survey, Visa managers are encouraged 
to present the results to their teams and discuss 
opportunities for improvement. Teams across Visa are 
empowered to take action based on survey results.  
In addition, the Simplify Work and Tools (SWAT) 
committee formed to improve global tools, processes 
and policies at Visa, resulting in changes that have 
received positive feedback from employees.
Employee Safety 
Visa’s Global Security and Safety (GSS) team is responsible 
for protecting Visa staff and safeguarding company 
facilities. Visa assesses and manages risk to ensure the 
delivery of global security, emergency response and 
safety management in support of our employees, 
wherever they work.
Our GSS team monitors:
  Emerging security threats such as natural  
disasters, civil unrest and terrorist attacks via security,  
government and media sources
  Visa personnel on business travel and employees 
who are working outside their home countries
  Visa assets including facilities and strategic  
third-party sites  
 The GSS team is able to assess and respond to threats, 
prioritize the safety of potentially affected employees 
and engage appropriate senior executives to enable 
response mechanisms.
 Gold Award for RoSPA 
In 2018, for the fourth consecutive year, Visa  
in Europe was awarded the Gold Award for 
Occupational Safety and Health by the U.K.’s 
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents 
(RoSPA). The award highlighted once more our 
strong leadership and workforce commitment  
to occupational health and safety.Employee Benefits
Our employees are one of our most important assets, and 
we structure our Total Rewards and Benefits Package to 
attract and retain a talented and engaged workforce. We 
continue to add to and evolve our programs to meet our 
employees’ needs, providing comprehensive health, 
financial wellness and quality-of-life coverage. 
We believe this approach has been successful, as we 
were proud to see that 83 percent of our employees 
favorably rated Visa’s employee benefits in our 2018 
employee engagement survey, compared to 75 
percent in 2017. 
Visa maintains a portal, available to most of our 
workforce, that provides employees with a streamlined 
experience for all benefits information.
Health
Visa focuses on supporting employee health with a 
variety of tools, which vary by location, and include  
an online wellness portal, onsite fitness centers, group 
exercise classes, gym membership discounts, seminars 
on healthy lifestyle topics, ergonomic consultations 
and free annual flu immunizations. We also help our 
employees to prioritize their mental health by offering 
an Employee Assistance Program.
In 2018, we introduced a new expert medical guidance 
program in the United States designed to support our 
employees and their families in navigating medical 
care systems. The program provides medical provider 
matching, appointment scheduling, second medical 
opinion services, as well as guidance via phone or 
video chat. Financial
In addition to base salary, Visa provides various forms 
of financial payments, benefits and services to our 
employees, such as bonuses, pre-tax contributions  
to eligible savings accounts and our employee stock 
purchase plan (ESPP). Visa’s ESPP enables employees to 
contribute 1–10 percent of eligible compensation toward 
the purchase of Visa stock at a 15 percent discount and 
applies to full- and part-time employees who work at 
least 20 hours per week in our larger locations. 
In early 2018, Visa increased our 401(k) match for 
participants in the U.S. We now contribute $2 for every 
$1 our employees contribute, up to 5 percent of base 
pay, for a total of 10 percent. All regular U.S. employees, 
except Executive Committee members, are eligible for 
the increased 401(k) match.Life
We offer programs to support our employees in  
the moments that matter. Specific services vary  
by location and include programs such as: 
  Paid time off  
and holidays 
  Child and elder  
care services
  Concierge and  
errand running    Auto and home 
insurance 
 Legal services
 Paid parental leave
 Adoption assistance
 Discounts program
During fiscal year 2018 and early fiscal year 2019, we 
introduced family emergency leave (10 days paid time 
off ) and increased paid bereavement time from three 
days to five days in some locations. 
Reflecting the value that Visa places on our people, we 
foster an inclusive culture that supports flexible work 
in a way that ensures both positive employee and 
company outcomes. We aim to support employees in 
achieving personal and professional goals where roles 
allow, and at the same time we expect employees to 
be flexible in order to ensure we are always meeting 
the needs of the business.We offer programs to 
support our employees in  
the moments that matter.

Diversity & Inclusion 
At Visa, we foster an inclusive workplace that encourages 
diversity of thought, culture and background. We want 
our employees to feel like they can bring their whole 
selves to work, creating an environment where diverse 
perspectives are voiced and heard. We are a global 
team that celebrates the uniqueness of each individual. 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion begins at  
the top. Visa’s Executive Committee, with support from 
our CEO and Chief Diversity Officer, oversees diversity 
and inclusion within the company. The Committee  
meets quarterly to review, develop and recommend 
opportunities for us to grow our diversity and inclusion 
program and to drive accountability for results. Our investments in diversity and inclusion training, 
combined with our dedication to building a diverse 
talent pipeline, help foster the growth and development 
of all employees. We also collaborate globally to solve 
important challenges like equal pay and minority 
representation and work to address unconscious biases. 
In 2018, we created a Gender Inclusion Council,  
which meets regularly to discuss gender inclusion  
and representation within Visa. The Council, composed  
of 20 Visa leaders from around the world and led by 
two senior executives, underscores the importance  
of including both men and women in the dialogue  
and Visa’s overarching commitment to create an 
environment where everyone can advance. The 
Council also leads the developments of live inclusion 
case studies to discuss real-life scenarios created to 
drive a more inclusive working environment.  In addition, the Diversity & Inclusion College at Visa 
University offers a specialized diversity and inclusion 
curriculum and provides tools and resources to help 
employees understand diversity and inclusion and 
their impact in the workplace. We expect that all  
of our people managers participate in an Inclusive 
Leadership Training via the Diversity & Inclusion 
College by 2019. The curriculum encourages an 
inclusive and collaborative environment within  
teams and within Visa. In 2018, we also continued  
to strengthen our leadership development programs  
for diverse employees, including:
  Elevate — Our leadership development program  
for high-performing African American/Black and 
Hispanic/Latinx employees. More than half of 
program participants have received promotions or 
expanded opportunities since entering the program.
  Executive Edge — Our leadership development 
program for female employees, developed in 
partnership with University of California – Berkeley’s 
Haas School of Business. Since entering the program, 
a majority of program participants have received 
expanded roles at Visa.  
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion extends 
beyond internal initiatives. In 2019, we sponsored the 
FIFA Women’s World Cup in France and became the 
first-ever Union of European Football Associations 
(UEFA) sponsor dedicated to women’s football. 
In addition, Visa offers programs and campaigns that 
help build women’s financial literacy and support 
female entrepreneurs, such as “Money is Changing” 
and “She’s Next, Empowered by Visa” . For more 
information about these programs, see the  “Empowering 
People and Economies”  chapter of this report. Partnering on

Environmental  
Sustainability
As we use our electronic payments network to 
connect cardholders, financial institutions, merchants 
and governments around the world, we recognize  
the importance of understanding and minimizing the 
environmental footprint of our payments ecosystem. 
In 2018, we continued our systematic approach 
through our commitment to measure our global 
impact, implement reduction and mitigation initiatives 
and report on our progress through formal and 
informal channels.
Measuring & Reporting 
Visa has completed eleven global environmental 
impact audits, a process dating back to 2008 — the 
year of Visa’s initial public offering. Conducted with 
oversight by a leading third-party environmental firm, 
the annual process measures our global energy usage, 
water usage, waste production, landfill diversion  
and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including  
Scope 3 emissions from our business travel, employee 
commuting and global procurement activities. Our direct 
environmental impact in these areas primarily results 
from energy used in data centers and business offices. 
To continue to improve the management of our 
environmental impacts and report on our progress,  
we have continued to improve global data collection 
around the world across our areas of impact (see 
accompanying chart). In 2018, we once again provided a quantitative and 
qualitative public response to the CDP Climate Change 
questionnaire, as well as participated in the CDP 
Supply Chain Initiative. We provide a summary of data 
submitted to CDP in this report. We also obtained 
independent verification of our energy and emissions 
data by Bureau Veritas. 
Based on our materiality assessment, we report on  
our environmental impact in the following areas: 
 Energy and climate
 Water
 Waste
 Transportation
Energy & Climate
With the global prioritization of the potential impacts 
of climate change, we have increased our focus on 
measuring and addressing the area contributing most 
to our environmental impact — our use of energy. 
While our footprint is smaller than that of more 
resource-intensive industries, we are committed  
to continue improving our energy efficiency and 
procuring clean energy when possible. In calendar year 2018, we used approximately 711,268 
gigajoules (GJ) of energy from electricity, natural gas 
and other fuels. This represents a slight increase of  
4.5 percent compared to 2017, which resulted from 
the continued expansion of our operations, with our 
employee headcount growing by 7.4 percent and our 
square footage increasing by 3.2 percent year-over-year. 
Our energy intensity, a commonly used metric that 
adjusts for growth, improved by 9 percent year-over-year, 
representing four consecutive years of improvement. 
This energy use is reflected in our Scope 1 and  
Scope 2 emissions. 
Since 2009, we have used international standards — such 
as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol of the World Resources 
Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development — to calculate and report the GHG 
emissions associated primarily with our energy usage. 
In 2018, our direct (Scopes 1 and 2) GHG emissions, 
measured in absolute terms with a market-based 
approach, were 62,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (MTCO2e). This represents a 5 percent decrease 
year-over-year from 2017 and a 34 percent decrease 
from our 2009 baseline year, largely driven by green 
building design, energy efficiency and the progress 
towards our commitment to purchase 100 percent 
renewable electricity.

2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Long-Term Climate Risks  
& Opportunities
 In response to increasing concern about the 
impact and risk associated with climate change, 
Visa completed our first formal climate risk 
assessment in alignment with the Task Force  
on Climate Related Financial Disclosures. We 
conducted a scenario-based climate assessment 
across many geographies to identify the risks 
and opportunities related to our operations  
and the broader transition to a low-carbon 
economy. We expect the results of this analysis 
to continue to inform our key functions, including 
risk, strategy and government engagement. Since 2009, our baseline year, our global office square 
footage has increased by 64 percent and our global 
employee population has grown by 159 percent. Our 
emissions intensity indicators have decreased as we 
have become more efficient and purchased renewable 
energy while growing our business.  
Specifically:
  Direct emissions per employee: decreased 12 percent 
vs 2017; decreased 75 percent vs 2009 baseline
  Direct emissions per square foot of space: decreased 8 
percent vs 2017; decreased 60 percent vs 2009 baseline
  Direct emissions per dollar revenue: decreased 16 
percent vs 2017; decreased 78 percent vs 2009 baseline
In 2018, we expanded our Scope 3 emissions inventory 
and estimated emissions from the following relevant 
categories: business travel, waste and — for the first 
time in 2018 — purchased goods and services and 
employee commuting. We concluded that our Scope 3 
emissions result primarily from procurement of goods 
and services and from business travel. While our 
reported Scope 3 emissions increased year-over-year  
due to inclusion of additional categories, our emissions 
from commercial business travel decreased by 7 
percent from 2017. 
With our greatest energy usage and associated GHG 
emissions originating from purchased electricity at our 
offices and data centers, we continue to invest in 
energy efficiency efforts at those facilities. Our energy 
usage per transaction decreased by 16 percent 
compared to 2017. In offices around the world, we are investing in energy 
efficiency measures, including LEED -based building 
design and operations, lighting upgrades and motion 
sensors. We also have an efficient electronics policy 
that mandates at least 90 percent of new electronics  
in our largest corporate campus offices meet either 
ENERGY STAR or EPACT certification standards. As a 
result of these and other measures, at the end of 2018, 
67 percent of Visa’s owned or leased square footage, 
occupied by 64 percent of our employees, had 
achieved LEED (or other green-building certification). 
An additional 3 percent of square footage is pending 
certification approval (see sidebar, “Green Buildings”). 
In our data centers, we focus on being intelligent users 
of energy. We continue to address energy efficiency, 
advance our mechanical cooling approach, reduce 
refrigerant use and decommission underutilized 
servers through our award-winning efforts. Our largest 
data center was certified LEED Silver in 2010. The 
center incorporates a reflective roofing material, 
reclaimed water system and an advanced indoor air 
quality system. 
In 2018, we committed to transition to purchasing 
renewable electricity equivalent to 100 percent of  
our global electricity usage, and in 2018 we were 
purchasing or in contract to purchase renewable 
electricity in London, Foster City, San Francisco,  
Austin and other key locations.

35UN Climate Change engagement
At the COP 24 climate conference in Katowice, Poland, Visa partnered 
with United Nations Climate Change and the Adaptation Fund to 
showcase how contactless technology could enable environmental 
giving. Over the course of the event, the platform logged over  
19,700 taps for donations toward climate adaptation.
Travel & Transportation 
With employee business travel and employee 
commuting comprising one of the largest sources  
of GHG emissions, Visa continues to identify,  
enable and encourage more sustainable travel  
and commuting behavior among employees. 
Programs include the following:
  Shuttles: Visa offers employee shuttles between 
nearby public transit hubs and other offices. Over 
the course of 2018, we provided 290,000 rides and 
reduced emissions from employee commuting by 
1,431 MTCO2e.
  Public transit: We encourage employees to use 
public transportation by offering transit subsidies. 
  Virtual meetings: We provide and encourage the use 
of videoconferencing technology to reduce the need 
for business travel, especially international travel.Water 
At Visa, we recognize the growing importance of water 
as an environmental sustainability topic. Our business 
offices and data centers account for most of our water 
use, and we continue to focus on understanding, 
measuring and reducing our water impacts. 
In 2018 we identified major areas of water usage to 
inform our efficiency and reduction efforts. Globally, 
we estimated using 49,410,996 gallons of potable 
water in 2018, with 76 percent occurring in the United 
States, 6 percent in the United Kingdom and the 
remainder in the Philippines, Singapore and elsewhere. 
By business source, 75 percent of potable water usage 
originated in our offices while 25 percent occurred  
in our data centers.
Informed by our understanding and measurement,  
we invest in water efficiency projects, including 
waterless cooling, water reuse and innovations in  
heat rejection in our data centers, as well as sensors  
on water fixtures and low-flow toilets in our business 
offices. In one data center location — our largest  
water user, responsible for almost 20 percent of  
Visa’s total — we deployed technology that reduces 
potable water use by 80 percent. 
Waste Reduction & Diversion 
Through waste reduction, recycling and composting 
efforts, Visa is working to curb the amount of office 
waste we dispose of in landfills. While not a major 
producer of solid waste, we are proud of our continued 
progress. We have increased our landfill diversion  
rate from 57 percent in 2014 to 76 percent in 2018.
In 2018, Visa completed the 
first estimate of emissions 
from purchased goods and 
services and identified 
major areas of water usage 
to inform our efficiency 
and reduction efforts.

Empowering  
Sustainable Lifestyles
At Visa, we are extending our commitment to 
environmental sustainability beyond our direct 
operations through our initiatives to inspire and 
empower sustainable lifestyles among our employees, 
as well as participants in commerce more broadly.  
Employees
We are committed to empowering our 17,000 employees 
around the world to be sustainability stewards in the 
workplace, at home and in our communities. Informed by 
our global employee green survey, in which employees 
expressed strong expectations of Visa’s environmental 
performance, as well as interest in participating in 
sustainability initiatives, we continued and expanded  
our employee engagement initiatives: 
  Visa launched employee Green Teams in  
several of our largest office locations to conduct 
environmental projects, host events and  
develop sustainability-focused community 
volunteering opportunities. 
  We also launched the Visa Eco-Challenges program 
to enable employees to commit to more sustainable 
choices or activities, such as taking public transit, 
changing out light bulbs or opting for the stairs 
instead of the elevator. During the launch, Visa 
employees committed to more than 2,000 actions  
in the first three weeks.   Visa celebrates Earth Month with educational  
events, expos, service projects and other activities. 
We highlight environmental causes and events to 
which employees can contribute using the 16 paid 
hours of volunteer time off that Visa provides. 
  We offer commuter benefits to encourage the use  
of lower-carbon or public transportation. More than 
2,400 employees use these commuter benefits. 
  Visa provides information and drop-off locations  
to help employees responsibly dispose of and 
recycle e-waste. 
Consumers
Visa is also committed to inspiring and empowering 
sustainable lifestyles. 
In 2018, we partnered with the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
Adaptation Fund on an initiative to help people 
support climate environmental action in a new way.
Through this effort, Visa created a contactless payment 
kiosk at the 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) in 
Katowice, Poland. The event featured a simulation  
in which a landscape of deforestation improved as 
attendees tapped a Visa contactless card. For each tap, 
Visa donated €3 to the climate resilience projects of 
the Adaptation Fund for afforestation and conservation 
projects in developing countries, with more than 
20,000 taps made during COP24. 
Visa is committed to empowering our 17,000 employees around the world to be 
sustainability stewards in the workplace, at home and in our communities. Our employees 
continue to share their willingness to be active participants in environmental efforts.Corporate Governance 
 
Visa’s governance practices promote long-term value 
and strong board and management accountability  
to our shareholders, clients and other stakeholders. 
In 2018, we continued key corporate governance 
practices, including: annual election of directors; 
majority voting for directors; proxy access; annual 
board, committee and director evaluations; risk 
oversight by committees and full Board; and stock 
ownership requirements for directors and executive 
officers. We continued our proactive ongoing 
engagement with shareholders and discussed 
summaries of the feedback with our Board. Board & Committee Structure 
Visa’s Board of Directors consists of 10 members.  
Other than our Chief Executive Officer, all directors  
on our Board are independent, including the Lead 
Independent Director. 
The board includes four committees: Audit and  
Risk, Compensation,  Nominating and Corporate 
Governance and the recently-created Finance 
Committee, effective January 1, 2019. All four  
Board committees are 100 percent independent. 
Board Composition
An important function of the Board is succession 
planning and Board refreshment. The Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee focuses on Board composition and future direction of the business to 
ensure a mix of skills, experience, tenure and diversity 
that promote and support Visa’s long-term strategy. 
Our Board and each of our committees conduct an 
annual evaluation, which includes a qualitative 
assessment by each director of the performance of  
the Board and the committee or committees on which 
the director sits. The Board also conducts an annual 
peer review, which is designed to assess individual 
director performance. The Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee oversees the evaluation process. 
Over the past few years, the evaluation process has  
led to a broader scope of topics covered in Board 
meetings and to improvements in Board process.  
Last year’s evaluation contributed to the Board taking 
the following actions:
 Appointing a new member to the Board
  Holding one of its quarterly meetings in our London 
office to focus on Visa’s strategic direction in Europe
  Forming a Finance Committee to oversee the 
Company’s financial-related matters, including 
finances, investments, mergers and acquisitions, 
debt, and other tax, treasury and insurance matters 
Board Diversity
The Board, through the Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee, strives to reflect the diversity 
of our key constituencies around the world (clients, 
consumers, employees, business partners and 
shareholders). While the Board does not have a  
formal policy on diversity, in assembling our Board,  
our objective is to have wide diversity in terms of 
business experiences, functional skills, gender, race, 
ethnicity and cultural backgrounds. 
3940Board & Executive Compensation 
Programs & Philosophy
We provide our named executive officers (NEOs) with 
short- and long-term compensation opportunities  
that encourage improving performance to enhance 
shareholders’ value while avoiding excessive risk-taking. 
We maintain compensation plans that tie a substantial 
portion of NEOs’ overall target annual compensation  
to the achievement of the company’s corporate 
performance goals. The Compensation Committee 
employs multiple performance measures and strives to 
award an appropriate mix of annual and long-term equity 
incentives to avoid overweighting short-term objectives.
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices 
are important elements of Visa’s long-term corporate 
strategy (and included in the company’s seven 
strategic pillars), and contribute to Visa being a 
sustainable and responsible corporate citizen. As  
part of our annual incentive plan, the Compensation 
Committee measures individual performance of Visa’s 
executive officers by reviewing their achievement of 
pre-established goals that further one or more of the 
company’s seven strategic pillars. A number of these 
individual goals promote and incorporate ESG factors, 
including diversity and inclusion, employee leadership 
and development, cybersecurity and data privacy,  
and financial inclusion and access. In addition, 
individual performance, which is tied to the strategic 
pillars, is considered when setting the value of the 
officers’ long-term equity award. Our non-employee directors receive a combination  
of cash and equity compensation for their service on 
our Board, reflecting their significant commitment  
of time and the skill level required of members of our 
Board. Our Compensation Committee structures this 
compensation with the goal of attracting and retaining 
a high caliber of directors and aligning their interests 
with those of our shareholders. 
A detailed review of executive and board 
compensation is provided in our proxy statement. 
Risk Oversight
The Board recognizes the importance of effective  
risk oversight in running a successful business and in 
fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities to Visa and our 
shareholders. While our senior leadership team is 
responsible for the day-to-day management of risk, 
our Board is responsible for promoting an appropriate 
culture of risk management within the Company to set 
the right “tone at the top.”  The Board is also responsible 
for overseeing our aggregate risk profile and monitoring 
how we address specific risks, such as strategic and 
competitive risks, financial risks, brand and reputation 
risks, cybersecurity and technology risks, legal and 
compliance risks, regulatory risks and operational risks.
More information on the oversight of risk by the  
Board and its committees can be found in Visa’s 2019 
Proxy Statement. 
2018 Committee Updates
In 2018, the committees focused on the 
following priorities:
  The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed  
the key risks facing Visa and oversaw the 
Company’s response to several regulatory 
developments, including adoption of the 
GDPR in Europe and corporate tax reform  
in the U.S. 
  The Compensation Committee continued 
with its commitment to paying for 
performance and preferring variable over 
fixed pay through the use of multiple metrics, 
compensation types and measurement 
periods designed to support shareholder 
value creation, while avoiding undue risk. 
  The Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee continued to focus on Board 
composition and structure, including adding  
a new member to the Board and forming a 
Finance Committee to assist the Board in its 
oversight of the Company’s financial matters. Shareholder Engagement
Our Board and management team greatly value the 
opinions and feedback of our shareholders, and we are 
committed to proactive, ongoing engagement with our 
shareholders throughout the year. In 2018, in addition 
to regular interaction of our Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations team 
with investors, we reached out to our top 50 investors, 
representing more than 50 percent of our outstanding 
Class A common stock. We also held in-person and 
telephonic meetings with 26 institutional shareholders 
representing approximately 37 percent of our 
outstanding Class A common stock. 
Topics covered during our discussions with  
investors included:
  Board composition and refreshment, including 
diversity and skills criteria 
  Board risk oversight, including cybersecurity  
and privacy 
  Our executive compensation program  
and philosophy 
  Additional corporate responsibility and sustainability 
topics, including human capital management and 
environmental sustainability
A summary of the feedback we received was discussed 
and considered by the Board, and we have made 
enhancements to our disclosures to improve 
transparency in these areas.
Further details of our governance practices are provided 
in our Corporate Governance Guidelines  and our 2019 
Proxy Statem ent.

4243Ethics & Compliance 
Trust underlies everything we do at Visa. We maintain 
the trust of our stakeholders through a culture of 
honesty and integrity, in which we hold ourselves to 
the highest ethical standards and strive to continuously 
strengthen our ethics and compliance program. 
Our commitment to ethics and compliance starts with 
our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code), 
which applies to everyone working with or on behalf 
of Visa, including employees, contingent staff and the 
Board of Directors. Visa also has adopted a Supplier 
Code of Conduct,  which applies to our suppliers. All 
Visa employees are required to annually certify that 
they have received and will comply with the Code, 
disclose conflicts of interest and complete compliance 
training. In 2018, we revised our Code to:
  Provide greater clarity on the expectations of 
employees regarding media inquiries, use of social 
media and service on external commercial boards
  Highlight requirements for safeguarding sensitive 
data from unauthorized use or disclosure
  Emphasize Visa’s position relating to harassment  
and discrimination and close personal relationshipsCompliance Program
Visa’s global compliance program provides processes 
and controls to manage legal and regulatory risk,  
drive an ethical culture and empower the business  
to achieve Visa’s objectives legally and with  
integrity. Compliance coordinates closely with other 
functions such as Controllership, Risk Management, 
Information Security and Internal Audit to ensure  
robust cross-functional management of Visa’s risks. 
The Office of the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), 
along with the business leadership, is responsible  
for Visa’s global compliance and ethics program. The 
program includes mandatory compliance training  
for employees and contingent staff. New staff are 
required to complete the curriculum within their  
first two months at Visa, and annually thereafter. The 
majority of the training appears as online learning 
modules, with some additional training sessions 
provided in person. In addition to annual Code of 
Conduct training, required in-depth training courses 
include the following topics: Anti-Bribery, Anti-Money 
Laundering, Antitrust and Competition Law, Data 
Privacy, Key Controls, Political Participation, Lobbying 
and Contributions, Prevention of Insider Trading, 
Records Management and Workplace Harassment  
and Discrimination. 
Our employees recognize our commitment to ethics and compliance. In our 2018 
employee engagement survey, over 90 percent of respondents stated that they  
believe that Visa behaves ethically in its business dealings, and that the company 
promptly investigates and addresses allegations of misconduct/unethical behavior. 
Named the winner of Corporate Secretary 
magazine’s “Best Compliance and Ethics 
Program (Large cap company)” award in  
both 2017 and 2018
Named to the World’s Most Ethical 
Companies list by Ethisphere Institute for 
seven consecutive years (2013–2019)44
Commitment to compliance is a key part of the 
performance evaluations of our business leaders 
throughout the world, and includes the completion  
of pre-agreed actions to promote compliance, such as 
improving controls, striving for 100 percent compliance 
training completion, top-down leader communications 
emphasizing the importance of compliance and other 
activities that are assessed each quarter and annually. The 
performance of these activities is included in a scorecard 
that considers both the achievements of the business 
leaders, as well as how the achievements are made. 
The Compliance program also encompasses 
implementation and monitoring of compliance 
policies and procedures, internal controls and 
communications to prevent and detect unethical 
behavior, as well as the investigation of and follow-up 
on non-compliance incidents. Visa regularly measures 
the effectiveness of our compliance programs by 
conducting risk assessments of the program areas  
as well as validations of our controls. Visa is a member of the Compliance and Ethics 
Leadership Council, a leading provider of best practices 
research, executive education and decision-support services 
to Chief Compliance Officers. Visa also continuously 
benchmarks and scans for compliance-related best 
practices as a member of the Business Ethics Leadership 
Alliance, High Technology Working Group and the  
Bay Area Ethics and Compliance Association.
The CCO works closely with the General Counsel, the 
CEO and the Legal department, reports to the Board’s 
Audit and Risk Committee and the CEO on a quarterly 
basis (or more frequently as needed) and briefs the  
full Board of Directors. Reports to the Board provide 
program performance results, compliance hotline 
metrics, employee training data, new program and 
communications initiatives, as well as updates on 
global regulatory developments. 
Visa’s Ethics and Compliance Working Group (ECWG),  
a cross-functional group chaired by the CCO,  
informs Visa management and key stakeholders  
of compliance-related issues and priorities. The ECWG 
also assists with strengthening compliance ownership 
in the business, promoting Visa’s culture of compliance, 
communicating changes to compliance program  
areas and updates to policies, coordinating and aligning 
with other controls functions and reinforcing the 
responsibility of each individual Visa employee  
to manage risk and maintain appropriate controls. 2018 Updates
In 2018, we introduced the Ethical Manager Toolkit 
(“Toolkit”) to provide managers with the resources  
to respond to a variety of ethics issues. The  
Toolkit — which is available through our Visa  
University Digital Campus — includes short videos, 
scenarios based on real-life situations and other 
materials for managers to use when dealing with 
potential ethics issues. Moving forward, we expect 
managers to use these resources to conduct ethics 
discussions with team members throughout the year. 
Over the course of 2018, Visa compliance officers visited 
44 of our global offices, meeting with employees to 
provide comprehensive training on our Ethics and 
Compliance policies and programs, observe office 
culture and listen to any staff concerns. The visits 
promote compliance awareness and foster an 
atmosphere in which employees feel encouraged  
to speak about any potential issues. Operating Within the Law
At Visa, we are committed to complying with applicable laws, following our Code and working with  
integrity. The Code provides our employees with guidance and links to resources, such as policies that promote 
compliance with laws and regulations. We highlight our commitment to three such policies here: 
Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorist Financing and Sanctions
Visa is committed to complying with all applicable anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing and 
sanctions laws and regulations. We conduct our business in compliance within the economic sanctions  
and trade embargo laws of the United States. Our decisions to do business with various partners are guided 
by applicable law and by considerations for protecting our clients and reputation. 
Anti-Bribery
Visa has a comprehensive Anti-Bribery Program that contains a robust set of preventive controls in place  
to ensure bribery risks are mitigated in our global operations. Visa’s compliance group conducts quarterly 
monitoring and testing to ensure the controls are working to mitigate any inherent risks. In addition, these 
controls are validated regularly by other corporate control functions, such as quarterly by Controllership  
and Operations Support, and by Internal Audit according to a schedule determined by its overall enterprise 
risk assessment rating.  
Our Anti-Bribery Program requires background checks on all third-party intermediaries working with public 
officials, and requires intermediaries to periodically certify compliance with applicable bribery laws. In July 
2018, we distributed a copy of the Anti-Bribery Policy training to third-party intermediaries to remind them  
of Visa’s Anti-Bribery procedures and their own anti-bribery responsibilities arising from their relationships with 
Visa. In 2019, we published our Anti-Bribery Policy  externally. 
Antitrust and Competition Law Compliance
At Visa, we want to outperform our competition based on the merits of our products and services, not 
because of unfair business practices. We comply with applicable antitrust and competition laws and do  
our part to promote a fair, competitive marketplace. We have an Antitrust and Competition Law Compliance 
Policy, which explains the purposes of competition laws and guides employees on compliance with such 
laws. We have also developed robust, customized training courses to raise awareness regarding competition 
laws and to reinforce our policy requirements.
In addition, the Legal function within Visa includes specialists who help ensure that we monitor changes  
and developments in Anti-Money Laundering, Antibribery and Competition laws and maintain up-to-date 
controls, policies and procedures for compliance with these laws.
45Engaging with  
Governments
As public sector decisions have the potential to 
significantly affect Visa’s business, direction and growth, 
Visa is committed to engaging with governments  
and their representatives in order to contribute our 
expertise on issues facing the global electronic payments 
sector. Through this engagement, we seek to identify 
areas of shared value between public sector goals and 
the expansion of electronic payments. As we do so,  
we are committed to acting ethically and transparently. 
First, Visa is committed to being an active, constructive 
and leading participant in global public policy issues. 
We aim to serve as a thought leader on global payments 
issues and also more broadly on the economy, growth, 
inclusion and development. Led by Visa’s Government 
Engagement team, Visa actively works with country, 
state and local governments around the world to For the third consecutive year, the CPA-Zicklin Index 
identified Visa as a “trendsetter” in political disclosure  
and accountability, the highest designation in the index, 
with a score of 95.7 out of 100.
develop thought leadership and regulatory analysis to 
identify unique insights that shape the future of global 
policy. In collaboration with partners across the world, 
we contribute to the global discourse on payments 
policy by sharing data-driven insights with policymakers 
and academic researchers. In the rapidly evolving 
payments industry, helping policymakers understand 
new technologies contributes to the development of 
innovative policies and programs for goals, such as 
ensuring payments system security, achieving greater 
financial inclusion, bringing more transactions into  
the formal economy and growing acceptance of 
electronic payments.Visa is a strategic partner of the World Economic 
Forum (WEF) and an active participant in the WEF 
FinTech Cybersecurity Consortium, which brings 
together regulators, academics and industry leaders  
to develop frameworks for public-private collaboration 
to help shape a digital future that is sustainable, 
inclusive and trustworthy. In addition, Visa is a 
corporate partner of the WEF Centre for the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution (C4IR), a San Francisco-based 
global institution that assembles governments, leading 
companies and experts from around the world to 
co-design and pilot innovative approaches to work,  
as well as to govern new technology. 
We also provide training and outreach programs to 
governments and policymakers around the world 
through Visa University and through partnerships with 
George Mason University and the Stanford Graduate 
School of Business, fostering the exchange of ideas  
on the law and economics of digital financial services.  
In 2018, Visa’s initiatives to engage governments 
included these highlights:
  Established a Development Finance Institution 
practice to enable more structured long-term 
partnerships with multilateral development  
banks and international organizations on shared  
priorities, including innovation, tourism and 
international trade.
46Innovation Pop-up  
in Washington, D.C.
In July 2018, Visa invited policymakers and thought 
leaders to a dynamic pop-up innovation experience in 
Washington, D.C. to engage with the latest in payments 
technology and learn how Visa serves as a trusted 
partner for financial institutions and merchants. By 
educating policymakers on our suite of services, we 
enable government officials to better understand our 
industry, business and capabilities. 47  Trained more than 947 participants from 42  
countries through the Visa School of Public Policy. 
New programs included a customized Executive 
Education program for Singapore, Malaysia,  
Thailand and Philippines participants, focused on  
a human-centered approach to regulation, as well  
as our first Executive Education program for LAC 
governments and policymakers, which focused  
on enabling payments in a digital economy.
  Commissioned the third iteration of the Government 
E-Payments Adoption Ranking (GEAR) Study  by the 
Economist Intelligence Unit to review the enablement, 
adoption and use of digital payments by 73 national 
governments and assess each country’s commitment 
to promoting and using digital payments in an 
inclusive way.
  Initiated research on a variety of payments policy 
issues, such as the global informal economy and  
the ways in which digital payments can alleviate 
global issues, and shared relevant, data-driven 
recommendations with policy makers.  
Second, as an industry leader, we believe in sharing 
our knowledge and understanding of the value 
created through global payments networks — for our 
shareholders and customers, and also for governments, 
citizens and the economy across the globe. We aim  
to maintain healthy and transparent relationships 
around the world by communicating our views  
to elected officials and policymakers. In 2018, we 
continued to engage officials and policymakers at the 
federal, state and local levels in the United States  
and internationally, providing them with information 
on our business model and commitment to maintaining 
best-in-class cybersecurity, as well as the innovations 
that enable access to financial services through 
government partnerships around the world. 
Third, Visa supports political interests that align with 
our business objectives, and we are committed to 
doing so in a responsible and transparent manner.  
Visa maintains a Political Participation, Lobbying and 
Contributions Policy to provide greater transparency  
to our stakeholders and facilitate enhanced Board 
oversight of our activities. The Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee of the Visa Board  
of Directors must approve all corporate funds used  
for political contributions. The Committee also reviews 
our Annual Corporate Political Contributions Report,  
through which we disclose all political contributions, 
including contributions toward annual trade 
association memberships for which dues exceed 
$25,000, and to U.S. tax-exempt organizations that 
draft model legislation, if applicable. Visa Political Action Committee
In the United States, Visa’s Political Action Committee 
(PAC), enables eligible employees to voluntarily pool 
their financial resources to support federal campaign 
committees and political party committees. The Visa 
PAC helps advance and promote a policy agenda that 
aligns with our industry and values. Visa publicly discloses 
all Visa PAC contributions, in accordance with the 
requirements of the Federal Election Commission. Human Rights
As a global payments technology company, Visa 
stands for acceptance, security, convenience and 
universality. We recognize our responsibility to respect 
and advance the rights of everyone, everywhere,  
and we are committed to establishing high ethical 
standards across our company and in our supply chain.
 
Our commitment includes respecting and advancing 
the human rights guided by international frameworks, 
including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (UDHR),  the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights  and the 
International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration 
on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.  
Visa’s cross-functional Human Rights Working Group 
oversees our human rights strategy, helping to 
coordinate our efforts to identify and mitigate human 
rights risks at Visa and in our value chain. The results of 
these efforts, as well as those taken by the Corporate 
Responsibility and Sustainability team, are shared with 
relevant members of our executive team and, as 
appropriate, with the Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee of the Visa Board of Directors. 
Periodically, Visa conducts a corporate-level human 
rights impact assessment to identify salient human 
rights issues across our business. Our human rights 
strategy, informed by these assessments, focuses on 
our role as: 
48An Employer

and advance the rights of everyone, everywhere.Centre for Sport  
& Human Rights
As a corporate sponsor of highly visible  
global sporting organizations and events, we 
recognize our role in helping promote human 
rights in sports. In 2018, Visa became a founding 
supporter and Advisory Council member of the 
Centre for Sport and Human Rights (“Centre”). 
The organization convenes governments, 
international organizations, sports bodies, hosts, 
human rights groups, trade unions, sponsors 
and broadcasters to work toward a world of 
sport that fully respects human rights. Through 
its work, the Centre is aligning the sporting 
world with the fundamental principles of 
human dignity, human rights and labor rights.
4950Responsible Sourcing 
Our commitment to operating responsibly and 
sustainably extends beyond our global operations,  
to our suppliers and business partners. We believe  
a responsible supply chain is essential to fulfilling  
our commitment, and we focus on deepening our 
partnerships with suppliers to meet or exceed social 
and environmental standards, drive innovation and 
efficiency, as well as create lasting, positive impact.
Through our global Supplier Code of Conduct,   
we outline our expectations of our suppliers in areas 
including human rights, employment practices, 
environmental impact, supplier diversity, conflicts of 
interest and other areas of responsible business practices. 
Further, we expect our suppliers to champion these 
values in their own supply chains.
 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct is distributed to 
suppliers globally, and they are responsible for 
establishing management systems that support  
the content of the Code.
In 2018, we continued implementation of our Supplier 
Code through:
  Developing Supplier Code of Conduct onboarding 
procedures to ensure continuity across all regions 
  Updating our Global Master Services Agreement 
template to reflect the Code 
  Updating our Global Sourcing Policy to reference 
the Code
  Publishing the Code online
  Training our Global Sourcing team on the Code’s 
principles and implementation Supplier Diversity
Visa recognizes that a supply chain that includes diverse 
suppliers promotes competition and quality from our 
vendors, drives innovation and helps us better reflect 
the diversity of our customers. In 2018, we benchmarked 
the Visa Supplier Diversity Program  against industry best 
practices to identify improvement opportunities. Based 
on the results, we aligned our program with our 
corporate Diversity & Inclusion  efforts and developed 
engagement plans to encourage supplier diversity 
considerations at each stage of our sourcing process. 
We encourage qualified small and diverse businesses 
to become official suppliers of products and/or 
services to Visa. Visa requires diverse suppliers to be 
certified by a third party certification organization or  
its regional affiliates (if applicable) and to maintain 
valid certification(s). We track U.S. supplier diversity  
in the following categories:
 Minority Business Enterprises (MBE)
 Women Business Enterprises (WBE)
 Disabled-owned business
  Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender-owned 
business (LGBT)
 Disabled Veteran-owned business
 Small, Certified HUBZone Business 
 Small Business Enterprises (SBE)  
We also encourage our prime suppliers to participate  
in Visa’s Second-Tier Initiative, established in 2018, which 
helps suppliers establish relationships with — and 
commit to promoting — diverse suppliers within their 
own supply chain. To promote accountability for this 
program, we request that participating prime suppliers 
report information and data on their use of small and 
diverse suppliers. 
Our Supplier Diversity Program is founded 
on four basic operating principles:
  Promoting diverse businesses and  
ensuring they have fair access to bid  
 and contract opportunities
  Communicating the value of supplier 
diversity, both internally and externally
  Growing the amount of quality products  
and services we procure directly from diverse 
suppliers or indirectly through companies 
who share our commitment to diversity 
  Recognizing unique competitive price  
and service offerings from small, diverse  
and underutilized service providers Report General Disclosures
