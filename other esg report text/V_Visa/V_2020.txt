Chairman & CEO
The convergence of global health and economic crises 
in 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, levied 
challenges on businesses, governments and society 
that required agility, innovation and cooperation  
to stabilize and, ultimately, to recover. Against the 
backdrop of loss this year, we saw long-overdue 
momentum toward meaningful change for racial  
and social justice and a growing urgency for action  
on climate change.
As an engine of commerce, Visa continues to work to 
bring the world back to business and to do our part in 
building a society where everyone, everywhere has 
the access and tools to meaningfully benefit from an 
interconnected global economy. As Visa continues to address these challenges, we are 
committed to delivering long-term value for all of our 
stakeholders. We believe economies that include 
everyone, everywhere uplift everyone, everywhere,  
and we are committed to contributing to an inclusive 
and sustainable world. Visa underscored its purpose-led 
values through our 2019 signing of the Business 
Roundtable Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation 
and, more recently, in 2020, by joining the Council for 
Inclusive Capitalism with The Vatican, a multi-stakeholder 
initiative working toward a more just, equitable,  
inclusive and sustainable economy. 
Conducting business amidst a global pandemic  
only increased our fundamental prioritization of the 
health and safety of our 20,500 Visa employees. Their 
wellbeing is paramount in our ability to serve, and I am 
proud of the significant resilience my Visa colleagues 
have demonstrated in continuing to deliver on our 
corporate mission. 
We also are proud of the additional progress Visa  
made throughout 2020 toward a more inclusive and 
sustainable world. We worked to support our clients and 
partners throughout the pandemic, with a particular 
focus on helping small and micro businesses during this 
challenging time. We made a new commitment to 
digitally enable 50 million small and micro businesses 
by the end of 2023 to help with economic recovery.  
We launched a comprehensive approach to supporting 
the movement for racial and social justice, including our 
new $10 million Visa Black Scholars and Jobs program, 
and established new goals to increase the number of 
employees from under-represented minorities in our 
workforce. We also completed our transition to 100% 
renewable electricity, issued our inaugural $500 million 
green bond, achieved carbon neutrality of our operations, appointed our first Chief Sustainability 
Officer and launched new offerings to embed 
sustainability in payment cards and accounts and  
to drive sustainable living and commerce.
Underpinning these efforts is our continued 
commitment to operate responsibly, ethically and 
transparently with strong, independent governance  
and to be an industry leader in environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) performance. We are proud of 
the recognition in 2020 of our ESG leadership, including  
the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, 
FTSE4Good Index, 100 Most Just Companies, 100 Best 
Corporate Citizens and World’s Most Ethical Companies. 
As I look to 2021 and beyond, I am confident Visa has 
the right strategy, people and partnerships to weather 
the storm and work toward a better future. Our core 
products and services can be catalysts for supporting a 
broader economic recovery. We are embracing a wider 
purpose relative to our planet, society and economies 
around the world, local communities and, of course, our 
shareholders and employees. By living our purpose, Visa 
can play an even greater role in transforming how the 
world moves money.
I invite you to read further about Visa’s commitment to, 
and progress toward, a more inclusive and sustainable 
future — for everyone, everywhere.  
Sincerely,
Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Visa

3Visa Joins Initiative  
to Make World Fairer, 
More Inclusive  
& Sustainable
In December 2020, Visa joined with other 
business and investment leaders to support the 
launch of the Council for Inclusive Capitalism 
with The Vatican, a partnership dedicated to 
reforming capitalism and building a fairer, more 
inclusive and sustainable world. Through the 
Council, members make commitments aligned 
with the four pillars of People, Planet, Principles 
of Governance and Prosperity and with the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
In conjunction with the launch, Visa made 13 
initial commitments, spanning topics such as 
inclusion and diversity, renewable energy and 
climate, small and micro business support, pay 
equity and human rights. In addition to Visa’s 
membership, our Chairman and CEO, Al Kelly, 
serves as a member of the Council’s Guardians. Our Environmental, Social 
& Governance Approach
As a global leader in payments, Visa has the opportunity 
and responsibility to join our clients, partners and other 
stakeholders to empower people, businesses and 
communities to thrive. We focus on mitigating risk and 
creating value across priority environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) issues in five groupings:
 Investing in Our Workforce 
 Empowering People, Communities & Economies 
 Securing Commerce & Protecting Customers 
 Protecting the Planet 
 Operating Responsibly
Relevant Memberships
Visa actively participates in ESG-related organizations 
and peer networks focused on various sustainability 
topics. Key memberships include:
 Business for Social Responsibility
 Business Roundtable
 Catalyst 
 Centre for Sport and Human Rights
 Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose (CECP)

Materiality1
To inform our ESG strategy, Visa maintains engagement 
with various stakeholder groups. We also conduct a 
biennial ESG materiality assessment in accordance 
with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines 
and reassess our approach to managing priority topics 
during interim years.
In 2021, we will conduct our next ESG materiality 
assessment. The assessment will incorporate 
developments in our business, recent trends, 
regulatory changes and stakeholder expectations  
that have emerged since our last formal assessment  
in 2019.
1  In this report, our use of the terms “material,”  “materiality” and other 
similar terms refers to topics that reflect Visa’s significant economic, 
social and environmental impacts or that substantially influence the 
assessments and decisions of a diverse set of stakeholders. We are not 
using these terms as they are used under the securities or other laws 
of the United States or any other jurisdiction or as these terms are 
used in the context of financial statements and financial reporting.
4Governance of ESG
At Visa, ESG activities are managed at a functional level across our strategic and 
operational areas, with executive and Board oversight.
At the management level, Visa’s Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Leadership 
Council has served as the central coordinating body facilitating our ESG strategy and 
reporting efforts. The Leadership Council has included cross-functional representation 
from more than a dozen senior leaders. At the Board level, the Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee of the Board has formal responsibility for and 
oversight of ESG policies, programs and reporting. In 2020, the Nominating and 
Governance Committee Charter was updated to reflect more comprehensively its ESG 
oversight responsibilities: “Oversee and review the Company’s management of topics 
relating to environmental, social and governance matters (“ESG”), including overall  
ESG strategy; stakeholder engagement and formal reporting; policies and programs  
in environmental sustainability, climate change, human rights, political activities  
and expenditures, and social impact and philanthropy.”
Stakeholder Engagement
Understanding the views and concerns of Visa stakeholders supports our work across 
our business and ESG strategic priorities. We regularly engage our stakeholders in a 
variety of ways:
 Employees: employee surveys, all-staff meetings
 Clients: client councils, payment forums
 Investors: shareholder earnings calls, direct engagement, SEC filings,  
investor conferences
 Government and policy officials: participation as panelists at policy gatherings,

8Employee Safety  
& Wellbeing 
Visa has a long-term commitment to the safety and 
wellbeing of our global workforce. In 2020, we 
developed and implemented a multi-faceted response 
to the global COVID-19 pandemic to ensure we lived 
up to this commitment to protect the physical and 
mental health and overall wellbeing of our employees. 
Visa’s response included an early commitment to our 
employees that there would be no pandemic-related 
layoffs in 2020. 
During the early stages of the pandemic, Visa’s support for 
our employees’ safety included implementing business 
travel restrictions aligned with recommendations from 
global health organizations, followed by closing our 
offices and providing employees with the information 
and resources necessary for them to work from home 
effectively and safely. To support our employees in the 
remote work environment, Visa also increased flexibility  
in schedules, encouraged individuals to collaborate  
with managers to balance professional and personal 
obligations and launched “Wellbeing Hours” to encourage 
schedule flexibility at the end of the work week. 
As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic worsened 
during 2020, we expanded our investments in and 
dialog around the mental health and wellbeing of our 
employees. We heightened our focus on mental health 
through key messaging from our leadership, targeted 
programs and expanded benefits. Our efforts included 
launching the Mental Health Network and wellness 
portal, delivering frequent communication from 
leaders and hosting mental health awareness events. 
In addition, we expanded benefits for our employees, 
such as temporarily increasing backup childcare 
options for employees in the United States.
While most Visa employees have been working from 
home since March 2020, Visa prioritized the safety and 
wellbeing of those Visa employees deemed “essential”  
to running our operations and needing to work from 
our offices and data centers throughout the pandemic. 
To protect this group, Visa worked to implement  
global best practices and ensure that all open facilities 
follow strict health guidelines. These steps also will  
be used to enable our wider return-to-office processes 
when appropriate. 
In addition to our comprehensive approach during  
the COVID-19 pandemic, Visa also prioritizes the safety 
of our employees during business-as-usual times.  
This work resides with the Visa Global Security and  Safety (GSS) team, which ensures the safety of Visa’s 
employees, contingent workers and facilities,  
including by establishing health and safety practices. 
The GSS team maintains a global Safety, Health and 
Environmental policy and provides trainings to 
executives and key employees on several aspects  
of the policy. To further protect our employees, Visa 
assesses and manages risks to provide security, 
emergency response and safety management in 
support of our employees around the globe. Our  
GSS team prepares for action by monitoring:
 Emerging security threats, such as natural disasters, 
civil unrest and terrorist attacks identified through 
security, government and media sources
 Personnel on business travel and employees who 
are working outside their home countries
 Company assets, including facilities and strategic 
third-party sites
9Employee Engagement
At Visa, we believe that building an engaged workforce 
is good for our employees and our business. Throughout the year, we engage with our employees through content on Visa’s intranet, digital signage, live events in offices (when possible), quarterly all-staff meetings and other approaches.
As part of our ongoing commitment to employee 
engagement, we adapted our global efforts to reflect the new working conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our actions included a new weekly  video series from our Chairman and CEO, as well as regular all staff meetings held by our regional  and functional leaders to allow employees to ask  direct questions about Visa’s response to COVID-19 and about other business activities. We also launched  a Virtual Life at Visa portal to help maintain our global employee community. 
We took additional actions throughout the year to 
better understand and address the evolving needs of employees during the pandemic. Actions included specialized engagement and feedback initiatives, as  
well as additional recognition and celebration programs.
94 percent of employees 
believed that employee 
health and wellbeing were 
a top priority for Visa.Pulse Surveys
During 2020, Visa implemented new employee pulse 
surveys — short-form questionnaires distributed more frequently — to replace our Annual Employee Survey. The pulse surveys assessed employee experiences related to engagement, satisfaction and wellbeing through two iterations in 2020. Given the challenges  
of COVID-19 and the sudden transition to remote  
work arrangements, these surveys were tailored to understand and respond to employee needs in an evolving and complex environment. According to  
the results of the employee pulse surveys, 94 percent  
of employees believed that employee health and wellbeing were a top priority for Visa, while 96 percent were pleased with the cadence of communications they received from leadership during this challenging time.
Performance Reviews
We recognized that 2020 posed unique productivity challenges for our global workforce. In response,  we pivoted our performance review system from  a ratings-based to a qualitative feedback-based  review process. This effort contributed to our  overall engagement approach that allowed us  to provide continuous feedback, flexibility and  support to employees.
Employee Recognition
To recognize our employees during the challenging year brought on by COVID-19, we launched several new employee recognition programs, including one  to enable our employees and people managers to celebrate their colleagues. In the first seven months  of this program, employees sent more than 5,700 virtual cards containing more than 37,800 messages  to their colleagues.Inclusion & Diversity
At Visa, we foster an inclusive workplace to encourage diversity of thought, culture and background. We  
seek to enable employees to bring their whole selves  
to work, creating an environment where diverse perspectives are voiced and heard. Through investments in inclusion and diversity training and a dedication to building a diverse talent pipeline, Visa promotes the growth and development of all employees.
Standing for global acceptance, Visa has made social 
justice and racial equality a business imperative. In 2020, we committed to increasing inclusivity through actions focused on our people, our community and our company.
Our People
By committing to building, retaining and investing in Black, African American and Latinx employees, as well as employees from other under-represented groups, we can create more socially and racially equitable teams overall. Visa established goals to build a more equitable workforce, including:
 Increasing the number of employees from under-represented groups at the vice president level and above in the U.S. by 50 percent in three years. 
 Increasing the number of under-represented Visa employees in the U.S. by 50 percent in five years.
10In 2020, we conducted the following initiatives to help 
achieve these goals:
Announced and began to accept app lications for our 
inaugural 2021-22 class of Visa Black Scholars & Jobs 
Program, in partnership with the Thurgood Marshall 
Foundation, with a $10 million investment fr
om Visa 
over the next five years. 
Through the program, select 
college-bound Black and African American high school 
students in the U.S. will receive yearly scholarship 
assistance, mentorship from Visa employees and the 
opportunity for an immersive internship experience. 
Those who meet all program requirements will receive 
a full-time job offer with Visa after graduation. 
Launched new talent experience programs to 
advance and retain our high-potential Black and 
African American talent, including an accelerator 
program to help support core leadership and 
management capabilities. The programs offer 
personalized career assistance and will serve as a 
blueprint for future programs focusing on Latinx 
and o
ther under-represented groups.
Embedded our commitment in the hiring process by 
formalizing the expectation for all job candidate slates 
to be diverse.
Partnered with the National Association of Black 
Journalists (NABJ) to build and diversify the
 
communications talent pipeline.
Instituted a Quarterly Business Review specifically 
focused on Inclusion & Diversity to track and 
review progress.
Launching a Pledge to Learn campaign to help 
employees understand inclusion and diversity, as 
well as to identify unconscious biases and ways to 
promote equity and equality in both personal and 
professional settings.Our Community
We encourage employees to build knowledge and 
understanding of each others’ backgrounds and experiences. We provide opportunities for education and community engagement to equip our employees to become active allies and learn behaviors that foster an inclusive workplace.
Allyship efforts include promoting educational 
dialogue through our Stand Together resources, including a “Race Talks” speaker series, to help employees explore racial injustices and challenges of under-represented groups. In addition, new manager training reinforces a culture of inclusion and allyship.
Throughout 2020, Visa employees mobilized to help 
advance social justice, racial equality and inclusion in the community through efforts including:
Partnering with the African American Credit
Union Coalition.
Expanding the focus of pro bono legal efforts tocauses such as addressing police discrimination,providing legal services to minority-owned smallbusinesses and remotely assisting asylum seekersstranded in Mexico with their asylum applications.
Raising over $1.3 million through a double-matchingcampaign to support three organizations promotingsocial justice and equality: the NAACP Legal Defenseand Educational Fund, the ACLU Foundation andthe National Urban League.
We launched the Visa Black Scholars & Jobs Program 
with a $10 million investment.
Our Company
As we continue to focus on inclusion and diversity within Visa, we are also using our influence as a company to catalyze change externally. For example, we are working to diversify our supply chain by updating sourcing language and considering diversity when making selections. For more information on our supplier diversity efforts see page 43 of this report. 
We also are using the strength and influence of the Visa 
brand to foster inclusive communities. We will continue to reflect under-represented groups in our marketing campaigns, sponsorships and events, including partnerships with a diverse set of Team Visa athletes who are representative of the communities where we live and work.
11Broader Inclusion  
& Diversity Initiatives
In addition to our racial justice-related commitments 
and programs, we continued our efforts to promote Inclusion & Diversity more broadly through ongoing initiatives, including:
 Elevate, an in-house program designed to advance African American/Black and Hispanic/Latinx employees at Visa. Elevate provides insights and strategies for career advancement, exposure and access to senior leaders and a platform to obtain feedback. Since its launch in 2017, more than 270 employees from across our U.S. offices have completed the program. 
 Executive Edge is a global leadership program designed to promote and retain women in leadership roles at Visa. Almost 140 women have completed Executive Edge since its launch in 2016. Female representation at the global executive leadership level at Visa increased from 30 percent at the end of fiscal year 2017 to 34 percent at the end of fiscal year 2020.
We also joined 56 other companies in the Gender and Diversity KPI Alliance (GDKA) to support the adoption and use of a set of key performance indicators (KPIs)  to measure gender and diversity in the companies and organizations. The KPIs include:
 Percentage of diverse directors on the board 
 Percentage of diverse employees by category
 Pay equality: the ratio of compensation by employee category (e.g., equal pay for equal work).
Visa proudly supports Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, 
Transgender and Queer or Questioning (LGBTQ+) employees and the broader community. The Visa  Pride Employee Resource Group (ERG) hosted “Pride Everywhere” virtual events in every region, intended to provide educational programming on topics ranging from the state of LGBTQ+ rights in various markets,  to intersectionality across diverse demographics, to resources and discussion forums for parents and allies of the LGBTQ+ community.
Our inclusion and equality efforts also recognize the 
unique contributions of employees with disabilities.  To celebrate contributions, Visa Employees with Disabilities (ViAble) and the Inclusion and Diversity team hosted virtual events throughout the month of October. Events featured the achievements of people with disabilities, including Paralympic athletes. This year also marks the launch of a new chapter of the ViAble Employee Resource Group in Europe.Employee Resource Groups
The Visa community-focused Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), as well as our broader Diversity  
& Inclusion Chapters, complement our broader corporate inclusion and diversity efforts. Together, they help foster an inclusive workplace environment that seeks to fully take advantage  
of employees' talents, skills and abilities.

131314Employee Learning 
& De
velopment 
Learning and development are critical components  
of Visa’s commitment to investing in our employees.  
Visa focuses on developing our current and future 
workforces through educational programs in areas such as payments, technology, professional development, diversity and inclusion, and leadership.
2020 brought unique workforce challenges, and Visa 
responded by quickly pivoting to an all-virtual learning environment, providing additional employee development opportunities and resources and launching a new learning platform. Key accomplishments included the following: 
 Introducing the Visa Learning Hub, a scalable digital platform bringing together more than 100,000 resources, including mandatory and voluntary materials and learning experiences. We updated courses throughout 2020 to address COVID-19 challenges. Our most utilized resources in 2020 included: “Working and Leading Remotely in Uncertain Times” , “People Leaders Supporting Mental Health in the Workplace” , “Together We Stand” resources for emphasizing allyship through empathy, authenticity and courage and “The Future of Payments” . 
Hosting Visa’s second annual global Learning Festivalvirtually. During the week-long festival, leadersprovided keynote speeches and shared ideas forcultivating growth. More than 17,000 Visa employeesregistered for a virtual event. We are pleased that
we w
ere able to safely provide an interactive
engagement opportunity for our global workforceduring the pandemic.Launching a modern, gamified platform foremployees to learn at scale about Visa products
and how the
y provide solutions for our clients.
In total, 96 percent of Visa employees worldwide engaged in optional learning activities, with the average number of courses per employee more  than doubling from 2019.
Developing the Future Workforce 
At Visa, we hold a longstanding commitment to cultivate an educated and skilled workforce. In support of our commitment, and as part of our 2018 Pledge  to American Workers, we continue working to enhance career opportunities for 14,500 individuals, both within  
and outside of Visa's workforce, including through apprenticeships and work-based learning programs  by 2023.
As part of the pledge, Visa launched the Dispute 
Resolution Certification Program, designed to train dispute resolution professionals — a role in high demand by financial institutions. In addition to offering our employees and clients these new certifications, we have set a goal to offer 500 program scholarships in the U.S. over the next three years to individuals who may not have the means through their employer.
As a further component of our commitment to 
develop the future workforce, Visa continued its membership in 2020 on the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, a 25-member advisory committee led by the White House and the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Board advised the  U.S. government  on ways the private sector and educational institutions can collaborate to prepare the current and future workforce to fill jobs demanding increasing levels of digital skills.
1415Employee Benefits 
Our employees are our most important asset, and we 
continue to enhance and evolve our programs to attract and retain a talented and engaged workforce. In 2020, we enhanced our benefit offerings to support our employees as they navigated the challenges posed by the pandemic. Our benefits vary by location, but may include the ones referenced below:

15Empowering 
People, 
Communities  
& Economies
16At Visa, we believe economies that include everyone, 
everywhere uplift everyone, everywhere. We are committed to helping build an inclusive economy that provides everyone with access to secure, convenient and affordable payments and other financial services  
to help meet daily needs and long-term goals and to advance financial opportunity for all.
In 2020, COVID-19 brought significant change to nearly 
every aspect of life. Businesses of various sizes and across industries faced new obstacles and uncertainty while adjusting to life during a pandemic. Throughout this period, we upheld our aim to uplift everyone, everywhere, using our products, network, financial resources and people to help support economic empowerment and recovery efforts. Our efforts centered on the following areas of focus: 
 Championing digital equity and financial access
 Supporting small and micro businesses (SMBs)
 Serving unbanked and underserved individuals
 Empowering women
Digital Equity &  
Financial Access
Technology has been central in the response to 
COVID-19. By increasing the reliance on digital tools, such as e-commerce, virtual meetings and contactless transactions to help slow the spread of the virus, the pandemic highlighted the “digital divide” — the gap between those who do and those who do not have access to digital networks and tools. At the end of 2020, nearly half the world still lacked access to the internet.  
In response to this reality, there is a growing movement 
for digital equity — the ability for all people to benefit from online tools and innovative technologies.
We see digital equity as central to accelerating safe, 
convenient commerce everywhere and supporting our mission to help individuals, businesses and economies thrive.
An estimated 1.7 billion people globally remain 
excluded from the formal financial system and from the tools and services that help them manage cash flow, save for life goals and manage unexpected life events. By expanding access to digital payments, Visa continues to help advance digital equity, improve the lives of millions of people and strengthen economies around the world. In 2015, Visa committed to provide 500 million previously unbanked or underserved people with access to a Visa-branded payment account by 2020, in support of the World Bank’s goal of Universal Financial Access. We met this goal in 2019, and we remain committed to expanding access to the unbanked and underserved.
In 2020, we announced a global commitment to 
digitally enable 50 million small and micro businesses 
by the end of 2023.
17Products & Services 
To help advance digital equity and economic 
empowerment we continually develop new and 
employ existing products. Examples include:
 Visa Acceptance Cloud: A next-generation 
cloud-based acceptance platform providing a 
point-of-sale (POS) solution that allows business 
owners to convert any Internet-connected device  
to a POS device, enabling access to a low-cost  
and scalable payments solution.
 Visa Direct: Businesses and individuals use Visa 
Direct to send and receive money between billions 
of cards and accounts worldwide. Businesses can 
use Visa Direct through their financial institutions  
to deliver fast, simple and efficient payments to 
customers and workers. Individuals can use Visa 
Direct to pay others back, send gifts, share costs,  
and support family around the world.
 Scan to Pay: Visa’s QR-based payments solution allows 
users to send payments directly from a Visa prepaid 
debit or credit card account to a range of merchants 
and businesses using just a mobile phone. Scan to Pay 
allows consumers to more easily access their money 
and merchants to seamlessly accept another form of 
payment without investing in specialized hardware.
 Tap to Pay:  Contactless payments, or tapping to  
pay with a contactless card or payment-enabled 
mobile device, which enable a secure, convenient 
and touchless payment experience without the 
need for customers to touch the checkout terminal.
 Tap to Phone: The Visa Tap to Phone service allows 
sellers to use a mobile application to accept payments 
without any additional hardware. Customers can pay 
by tapping their contactless card, phone or watch to 
the seller’s smartphone.Government Collaboration 
During COVID-19
In 2020, Visa collaborated with governments to help 
empower people, economies and communities, 
including in the following ways:
Emergency disbursements during COVID-19
Visa has a long history of helping government entities 
disburse funds. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
Visa helped governments disburse funds to citizens  
by leveraging our expertise, tools, products, solutions 
and network. In May 2020, we collaborated with our 
financial institution clients to support the U.S. Federal 
government’s delivery of nearly 4 million Visa prepaid 
cards for the first round of economic stimulus 
payments, and in January 2021, another 8 million Visa 
prepaid cards were sent out as part of the second 
round of stimulus payments. This is in addition to the 
more than 50 state government programs, where 
unemployment insurance and child support benefits 
are distributed through Visa prepaid cards. In addition, 
we facilitated pandemic relief payments in other 
countries, including France, Spain, Italy, Guatemala  
and the Dominican Republic. 
Expanding contactless payments around the world
Recognizing the global need to maintain physical 
distancing, and to increase consumer flexibility while 
delivering secure transactions, Visa worked with 
payments industry partners and governments to raise 
contactless transaction limits in more than 50 markets 
across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and in Canada, 
providing a secure and convenient way to pay.
The Visa Economic 
Empowerment 
Institute 
In 2020, we launched the Visa Economic 
Empowerment Institute (VEEI), a center for 
research and public-private sector dialogue on 
payments policy, committed to promoting and 
advancing equitable economic empowerment 
of individuals, businesses and societies around 
the world. 
A team of fellows, composed of subject matter 
experts in payments, development finance, 
international trade, cybersecurity and other  
key issues, will apply Visa’s global insights and 
expertise to help governments create more 
inclusive digital economies. The three focus 
areas of the VEEI are fostering digital equity  
and inclusion, unlocking growth through trade 
and imagining an open future for payments.
18Small & Micro Businesses
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift from 
in-person to digital commerce, which disproportionately 
affected small and micro businesses (SMBs). By leveraging 
our network, products and partnerships, we are helping 
sellers adopt digital commerce options to better respond 
to the pandemic.
To support SMBs around the world and the 
communities in which they operate, in 2020 Visa 
announced a global commitment to digitally enable  
50 million SMBs by the end of 2023. To accomplish this 
goal, we are introducing a range of locally-designed 
programs and solutions that include building online 
businesses, increasing the acceptance of digital 
payments and incentivizing neighborhood support.
Empowering digital-first businesses
Visa has built localized online resource centers — now 
available in more than 20 countries — providing tools, 
partner offers and information on starting, running 
and growing digital-first small businesses. In addition, 
across European markets, Visa is investing to increase 
the number of digital payment acceptance devices 
within shops by more than 50 percent.
Enabling digital payments
We are working with a range of partners to increase 
the number of locations where consumers can tap 
their contactless card or mobile phone. For example, 
Visa introduced Tap to Phone in Peru to enable 
merchants to conduct contactless transactions.  
We also pioneered a new Scan to Pay solution in the 
Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region to enable 
consumers and merchants to exchange touch-free 
payments by linking their Visa credit, debit or prepaid 
cards to their mobile devices.Visa street teams also visited more than 300,000 small 
businesses in 12 markets over the course of 2020 to 
provide “back to business” kits with new point-of-sale 
materials, branding, educational resources and special 
offers. In early 2021, Visa introduced a virtual version of 
this program to offer small businesses access to tutorials 
on contactless payments, digital marketing and 
reputation management. 
Incentivizing neighborhood support
Visa partnerships encourage consumers to shop 
locally. We are offering the Visa Back to Business online 
tool that helps consumers identify businesses that may 
be open in the wake of the pandemic or a natural 
disaster. The online tool is now live in Australia, Canada, 
New Zealand, South Africa and the U.S.
Additionally, we launched the #WhereYouShopMatters 
campaign in support of SMBs in Europe, the Middle 
East, Africa and Asia Pacific. The campaign provides 
participating business owners with tools and 
information to help their businesses adapt and grow  
in response to the challenges introduced by COVID-19. 
We also have joined with e-commerce platforms like 
Shopify, and restaurant delivery companies, including 
Deliveroo, to reward consumers for spending their 
money locally.
Visa’s progress in 2020 also included the following new 
and ongoing programs:
 Offering Practical Business Skills, Visa's educational 
portal for small business owners in the United States, 
available in English and Spanish. In 2020, more than 
80,000 unique visitors accessed the portal to view 
40-plus educational modules and tools supporting 
day-to-day business activities. In early 2021, we 
launched the portal globally in four languages, 
including English, Spanish, French and Arabic. In China, facilitating connections between SMB 
owners and financial institutions to help the SMBs 
access support, tools and knowledge they need to 
recover from the pandemic.
 Collaborating with Fundes, a nonprofit in Latin 
America, to offer Enko — a capacity-building program 
to help SMBs improve their business management 
skills. In 2020, nearly 40,000 entrepreneurs accessed 
the training platform free of charge.
 Partnering with Gojek, an Indonesia-based 
multiservice technology platform, to help SMBs  
in Indonesia grow and increase their resilience 
through skill development.
 Continuing our multi-year agreement with Rappi,  
an on-demand delivery startup, to accelerate digital 
commerce and financial inclusion across Latin 
America and the Caribbean.
 Acting as a founding supporter of the Inclusive Fintech 
50 competition, which promotes startups addressing 
the needs of SMBs and underserved communities.
 Continuing the Visa Everywhere Initiative, an  
open innovation program aimed at supporting 
entrepreneurs and startups. In 2020, we hosted  
a special edition of Visa Everywhere Initiative, 
showcasing the intersection of fashion and 
technology. Participating entrepreneurs were  
tasked with solving emerging commerce challenges 
and providing visionary solutions for Visa’s vast 
partner network. They presented their solutions  
in front of an audience and a panel of judges, and 
the winner received a $25,000 prize. Since its 
inception, Visa Everywhere Initiative has grown  
to reach more than 100 countries on six continents. 
19Equitable Access Initiative
In 2020, Visa Foundation launched the Equitable Access Initiative, a five-year  
$200 million commitment to uplift gender diverse and inclusive SMBs around 
the world. Visa Foundation will provide $60 million in grants to NGOs dedicated 
to supporting SMB owners, many of whom are women, and support the creation  
of an enabling environment for capital to flow efficiently and effectively to SMBs. 
Visa Foundation also will allocate $140 million with investment partners using a 
gender lens to help SMBs grow and thrive.
In 2020, Visa Foundation committed the following as part of the Equitable 
Access Initiative:
 $3 million to Black Ambition, an initiative focused on Black and Latinx 
entrepreneurs launched by producer and entrepreneur Pharrell Williams  
in partnership with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).
 $1.5 million to Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), to increase  
small business resiliency for women entrepreneurs of color directly impacted 
by COVID-19.
 $300,000 to VC Include, a Women of Color-led organization providing 
training programs to Black-, Latinx-, Indigenous-, people of color-, and 
women-led funds to support their fundraising journeys and help them  
build relationships with investors.
In a separate effort, Visa Foundation continued a five-year, $20 million 
partnership with Women’s World Banking to support women-owned SMBs 
around the world. At the end of its third year, the partnership has reached 
more than 837,000 women entrepreneurs.Supporting Gig & Hourly Workers
As the gig economy grows, Visa is developing new services and working with  
external partners to support gig and hourly workers. Visa and our Earned Wage  
Access technology partners help accelerate payments to workers through Visa Direct, 
enabling workers to access and transfer earned wages to their bank accounts or 
eligible debit cards in real time, rather than after the typical two-week pay cycle.1  
In 2020, we continued supporting gig workers through previously-established 
programs and partnerships, including with DailyPay, FlexWage, Instant Financial, 
PayActiv, Wagestream and ZayZoon.
Empowering Women
In the wake of COVID-19, our mission to empower and uplift women is more important 
than ever as we seek ways to contribute to an equitable economic recovery. In 2020,  
we continued and expanded many of our programs and partnerships centered on 
empowering women, including: 
 Announcing a partnership with IFund Women, a funding and education platform  
that connects female entrepreneurs with access to capital through grants and 
crowdfunding, as well as business coaching and a network of other business owners
 Subsequently launching a series of She’s Next grants and educational resources 
through the IFundWomen platform to help Black female SMB owners run and  
grow their businesses
 Partnering with The Female Quotient, a female-owned business committed  
to advancing equality, on an ongoing digital series
1  Actual fund availability varies by receiving financial institution, receiving account type, region, and 
whether transaction is domestic or cross-border.
Visa Foundation made a five-year $200 million commitment to support SMBs 
around the world, with a focus on fostering women’s economic advancement.
20Women in Sport
At Visa, we believe sport presents a significant 
opportunity for women to pursue their dreams, both 
on and off the field. We underscore our commitment 
to champion economic empowerment through our 
efforts to empower women at the intersection of 
business and athletics. The following examples 
showcase our progress in 2020:
 Visa sponsored the 2020 SheBelieves Cup, an 
invitational women's football tournament held in 
the United States, and hosted a Practical Money 
Skills workshop at the event.
 Inspired by our partnership with UEFA Women’s 
Football and the FIFA Women’s World Cup, we 
launched The Second Half — a career development 
program to support female footballers in Europe.
 Visa, the China Women’s Development Foundation 
and Beijing Sport University announced a program 
aimed to empower women to grow their small 
businesses and contribute to local social-economic 
development and sustainable growth.
Financial Education
Visa is proud to provide free and accessible financial 
education to help people better manage their money. 
In 2020, we continued to offer our flagship program, 
Practical Money Skills, which provides individuals with 
free financial literacy tools and resources for every 
stage of their lives. The Practical Money Skills program 
is offered in 45 countries and 18 languages and 
reached more than 1.5 million individuals in 2020.Practical Money Skills Reach

Economic Empowerment in Africa
Visa is committed to helping bring SMBs in Africa into the digital economy and drive post-COVID-19 
economic recovery across the continent. To do so, we are enabling innovations in payments by teaming up 
with governments, fintechs, telecommunication companies and mobile money providers to reach more 
consumers and businesses. In 2020, Visa’s efforts to drive the digital transition in Africa included: 
 Entering a strategic partnership with Safaricom, Kenya’s largest mobile operator. Visa and Safaricom will work 
together to enable more than 24 million consumers, using a SIM card-based money transfer application, to 
make transactions at merchant locations throughout Visa's global network.
 Continuing a partnership in Kenya with Hand in Hand International, a global non-profit organization that 
focuses on developing economies and empowering women entrepreneurs in Africa and South Asia.  
In 2020, Hand in Hand enrolled 3,500 entrepreneurs in a program that provides business education and 
broader financial services. By the end of the three-year program, we plan to reach more than 10,000 SMBs, 
at least 75 percent of which are owned by women.
 Accelerating the digital transformation in Egypt in partnership with Fawry, an E-payment platform. The 
partnership aims to deliver Visa digital acceptance solutions to thousands of Egyptian merchants, enabling 
them to run and grow their business digitally.
 Teaming up with She Leads Africa, a networking platform for women, to connect women with the tools and 
information necessary to launch or grow successful businesses, helping boost female entrepreneurship 
across the continent. Through this partnership, Visa is engaging over 700,000 women entrepreneurs across 
Africa directly and through digital channels and direct engagements.
21Community Support
At Visa, we are committed to using our time, talent and 
resources to support and strengthen the communities 
and markets in which we operate. We engage at the 
local level through:
 Community Giving 
 Employee Giving 
 Humanitarian and Disaster Relief
Community Giving 
In 2020, Visa and Visa Foundation focused on 
supporting communities and SMBs, particularly during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as helping fight 
poverty and homelessness. 
Our corporate community giving efforts focused on the 
needs most relevant to the communities in which we 
live, work and do business. We supported charitable 
programs in more than 35 countries around the world. 
Our underlying giving themes included access to 
education, support for vulnerable populations, hunger 
relief and promotion of good health. 
In April 2020, Visa Foundation committed $10 million to 
provide immediate emergency funding to charitable 
organizations directly responding to the COVID-19 
pandemic across the five geographic regions where Visa 
operates. These organizations included the Red Cross 
($4.3 million), UNICEF ($1 million), Feeding America 
($700,000) and Food Banks Canada ($300,000).Visa Foundation also continued helping fight poverty 
and homelessness in the San Francisco Bay Area.  
In addition to previous commitments of $3 million  
to Tipping Point Community and $1.5 million to the 
University of California, San Francisco, in 2020 the Visa 
Foundation provided two new grants of $500,000 each 
to Compass Family Services and First Place for Youth.
Employee Giving 
We complement our corporate and Visa Foundation 
contributions by empowering employees around the 
world to give through donations of time, talent and 
funds. We encourage our employees to support causes 
important to them through various mechanisms, 
including the following: 
 Matching Gifts:  Visa matches employees’ personal 
donations 1:1 up to US $10,000 per year; we also 
offer 2:1 matching in response to major disasters 
and other significant events. 
 Volunteer Time Off (VTO): Visa offers two days of 
VTO each year to eligible employees; in response to 
the pandemic, we temporarily increased VTO from 
two to five days. 
 Dollars for Doers: employees can earn $10 per 
hour spent volunteering, up to $500 per year, to 
contribute to the charities they support.
 Team Volunteer Events:  we organize and fund 
team volunteering opportunities. During June’s Visa 
Volunteers Virtually month, teams of employees 
sewed masks, wrote letters to frontline workers and 
mentored students online around the globe.
 Community & Volunteering Councils: we support 
employee councils around the world that facilitate 
our programs at the local and functional levels,  
while also providing leadership development 
opportunities for employees.In 2020, while the pandemic created new challenges, 
our employees found ways to contribute. Nearly 6,000 
employees donated to 4,600 charities worldwide, which 
was matched by Visa for a collective $14 million — a 50 
percent increase over 2019 giving. In addition, despite 
the shutdown, more than 3,000 employees volunteered 
28,000 in-person and virtual hours for 600 charities.
Employees also helped support SMBs through Visa 
Foundation’s partnership with Kiva — a crowdfunding 
microfinance organization. Visa Foundation provided  
a grant of $1M to Kiva, and Visa employees had the 
opportunity to direct $50 each in loans to SMBs on the 
Kiva platform. More than 13,000 employees directed 
loans to support approximately 15,000 small businesses.
Additionally, in late 2020, Visa launched a Visa 
employee mentorship program with Bridge for  
Billions. Through this online program, Visa employees 
are mentoring Black, primarily women-owned SMBs  
in the U.S. on a three-month incubation journey  
to help them review their business models, define  
their financial projections, create growth plans  
for their ventures and more. In early 2021, Visa also 
partnered with Digital Boost, a nonprofit digital 
upskilling platform, to support UK-based small 
businesses seeking to digitize as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Through this program, 
employees apply their areas of expertise to mentor 
small businesses.
22Humanitarian & Disaster Relief 
Visa responds to humanitarian crises and disasters in 
communities around the globe by contributing our 
resources and unique capabilities in partnerships with 
governments, international relief groups and private 
organizations. To help facilitate the responses, Visa 
Foundation is an Annual Disaster Giving Program 
(ADGP) member of the American Red Cross, 
representing a commitment of $500,000 annually to 
help the Red Cross prepare for disasters across the U.S.
In addition to our response to COVID-19, Visa Inc. 
provided the following relief funding in 2020:
 Double-matching of employee donations in 
response to the Australia bushfires, California 
wildfires and the explosion in Beirut
 Waiving interchange fees in conjunction with  
our clients and donating Visa’s fees on eligible 
donations for a select group of U.S.-based charities 
focused on providing relief for California wildfires 
and Hurricane Laura
Giving Tuesday
In May 2020, in response to the need caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Visa employees helped raise nearly 
$1 million during our double matching campaign as part of #GivingTuesdayNow. The funding supported  
five beneficiaries, including the International Federation of Red Cross, American Red Cross, British Red Cross, 
Doctors without Borders and UNICEF.
In December 2020, Visa employees participated in the third annual double matching campaign on Giving 
Tuesday. More than 4,000 employees participated on that day and, combined with Visa's match, more than 
$5.9 million was donated to 3,900 organizations in 68 countries.

24Payments Security
At Visa, we are committed to building trust across  
our network and in the wider payments ecosystem 
through our investments in innovation and technology. 
While fraud attempts rose during the COVID-19 
pandemic, our Intelligent Security approach helped  
us continue to deliver seamless and secure customer 
experiences over the entire consumer lifecycle, 
including the following:
Onboarding & Management: Visa provides financial 
institutions with tools to identify identity fraud at account 
opening, and through our financial institution clients, Visa 
provides consumer tools to manage security, including 
restrictions on account use and customizing alerts.
Consumer Identity & Authentication: We use artificial 
intelligence-powered authentication strategies to 
prevent unauthorized access to Visa accounts.
Transaction Authorization: We aim to prevent fraud 
without inconveniencing consumers. We use tools 
such as Visa Advanced Authorization (VAA), which 
applies real-time artificial intelligence and machine 
learning to evaluate the trustworthiness of transactions.
Dispute Management: We help consumers and 
issuers to proactively address transaction disputes 
through Visa tools such as Verifi, which provides issuers 
and customers access to transaction information from 
sellers via a global data-sharing network.
Performance Optimization: An important piece  
of the Visa Intelligent Security strategy is our 
commitment to enhancing payment performance  
by reducing fraud and increasing efficiency.
The unprecedented and accelerated shift to 
e-commerce spurred by the pandemic also presented 
security risks and technology opportunities for Visa, 
consumers and the wider payments ecosystem. 
COVID-19 related fraud attempts have included 
phishing and social engineering attacks, such as 
impersonation to steal payment and personal 
information from shoppers; phishing for personal 
information tied to Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act stimulus checks; 
identity impersonation on credit card applications  
and other attempts, such as fraudulent “card not 
present” (CNP) transactions.Despite the increase in fraud attempts, we saw 
improvements in fraud rates during calendar year 
2020, in part due to the increased use of solutions such 
as Tokenization and EMV Chip cards. As the transaction 
mix shifted significantly towards digital channels, the 
CNP fraud rate decreased by 7 percent year-over-year 
in the fourth quarter of FY20. In addition, we recorded 
fraud improvements in the Card Present transaction 
set due to increased adoption of EMV chips and 
contactless payments. For example, in the fourth 
quarter of FY20, Visa experienced a 35 percent increase 
in contactless transactions, but a 40 percent reduction 
in the respective fraud rate year-over-year.
Visa prevented nearly $25 billion in fraud last year by using 
artificial intelligence to analyze global transaction data.
25Cybersecurity at Visa
Visa is committed to championing cybersecurity 
within our operations, while helping advance the 
security of the broader payments ecosystem. Our 
cybersecurity team comprises of more than 800 
professionals located in 11 offices on three continents, 
and operates 24x7x365 to detect, prevent and respond 
to threats in real-time.
At Visa, we continue to build our cybersecurity strategy 
on a layered defense-in-depth approach. We further 
advance our capabilities based on our core areas of 
focus, including enhancing our architecture, 
expanding our data security program to include 
unstructured data, and conducting continuous 
security and efficacy efforts. 
We use an established risk assessment methodology 
and framework which identifies cybersecurity risks and 
the associated impact to the organization, information 
that is regularly reported to the executive leadership 
team and Visa’s Board of Directors.
In 2020, we continued our comprehensive approach 
to cybersecurity, including:
Policy
The Visa Key Controls detail our approach to protecting 
our information assets and consumer nonpublic 
personal information. We assess the Key Controls 
annually and update as needed. Audit & Third Party Certifications
To ensure the effectiveness of our cybersecurity 
approach and systems, we conduct annual internal 
and external audits of our IT infrastructure and 
applications and are subject to examination by the 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council 
(FFIEC) and other regulators. Examples of external 
reviews include: Payment Card Industry Data Security 
Standard (PCI DSS), Statement on Standards for 
Attestation Engagements (SSAE-18) and International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402. In 
addition, we are subject to Privacy and Data Security 
laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and 
the European Union (EU) General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR).
Technical Controls
We use artificial intelligence and deep learning 
technology to monitor our network and understand 
the threats aimed at our company.
Training
We provide new employees with security awareness 
training and conduct annual training on Key  
Controls, as well as cyber awareness campaigns  
for all employees. 
Response & Resilience
We regularly conduct cross-functional response and 
resiliency exercises that involve multiple internal 
teams, as well as external partners and agencies. 
Collaboration
We continue to expand our global capabilities  
through Visa’s Cyber Fusion Framework, which  
enables us to rapidly collect, analyze and use  
cyberthreat intelligence.In a year marked by increasing cybersecurity risks 
related to COVID-19, we focused on maintaining our 
security posture ahead of the evolving threat landscape. 
Our efforts to mitigate risks, including malware attacks, 
data breaches and phishing scams, focused on 
continuous cybersecurity threat identification and 
increased prominence and frequency of cybersecurity 
awareness content delivery to employees. As one 
example, Visa hosted a month-long, multi-channel 
cybersecurity awareness campaign, which hosted six 
sessions and more than 2,000 attendees, which allowed 
employees to connect with cybersecurity experts and 
learn best practices for cyberattack protection.
Over the past several years, Gartner Consulting has 
assessed Visa’s security posture, and the results of  
each assessment reflect our progress. In 2020, Gartner 
Consulting once again gave Visa its highest rating 
among peer companies for the overall maturity of our 
cybersecurity program.
26Data Privacy 
At Visa, we believe that building trust begins with a 
commitment to privacy and security. We are committed 
to using the data entrusted to us to benefit consumers  
and help businesses and economies grow. 
Central to our approach to privacy is understanding  
the types of data we collect and process, for example, 
during a typical purchase transaction. When a consumer 
makes a purchase, Visa receives an account number, 
expiration date, security code and transaction data, such 
as merchant type, amount and date. We primarily use 
this card transaction data to facilitate purchases and 
protect consumers against fraud and identity theft.
We believe consumers expect convenience, security and 
privacy from their payment experiences. To meet these 
expectations, Visa upholds the following commitments:
 Visa does not sell personal information. Our Global 
Privacy Notice describes how we share information, 
such as when we process payments, provide 
services to card issuers, prevent fraud or with a 
cardholder’s consent.
 We only use personal information for defined, 
appropriate purposes. In addition to operating one of 
the world’s largest electronic payments networks, we 
provide authentication, fraud management, loyalty, 
consulting and data processing services. We also create 
data products that give our clients insights into their 
business performance. These products contain data 
that is de-identified to protect consumer privacy. 
 We adhere to the highest legal standards 
everywhere we operate. 
 We back our commitments with rigorous 
assessments. We integrated a comprehensive 
controls framework with testing and independent 
auditing into our Global Privacy Program. 
Our Global Privacy Office, composed of twenty-five 
professionals around the world, is led by Visa’s Chief 
Privacy Officer and closely coordinates with several 
cross-functional governance bodies. The Corporate 
Risk Committee and the Visa Board’s Audit and Risk 
Committee oversee the Global Privacy Program and 
the risks related to data privacy, including our 
compliance with current and emerging data 
protection laws around the world.
In 2020, we continued to enhance our Global Privacy 
Program, a comprehensive approach to managing 
consumer privacy with input from the highest levels  
of leadership. This included:
 Supporting compliance with new laws, including 
the California Consumer Privacy Act and the 
Brazilian Law on Data Protection, and championing 
a culture of accountability for privacy and data use 
throughout Visa Conducting regular assessments, testing and 
auditing as appropriate 
 Redesigning the Visa Privacy Center, including  
a new “Choice Portal” for consumer requests
 Deploying an updated Cookie Notice and consent 
management tool on all Visa websites
 Maturing of the Visa Data Use Council (VDUC), 
composed of senior leaders from across functions, 
chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer and responsible 
for reviewing and advising on new products and 
services that use personal information
 Launching the new Data Fluent Speaker Series, 
which brings together global business leaders, 
entrepreneurs, and academic experts to share 
insights and experiences concerning privacy  
and ethics in the context of the growing use  
of consumer data and technology
27Responsible Data Use
We recognize that consumers are concerned about 
their data, how it is being collected and used, and 
whether it is secure. Visa’s privacy commitments are 
reflected in our Privacy Notices and, where we market 
services directly to consumers, in the terms and 
conditions of those programs. 
To help consumers understand these commitments, 
we developed a set of Data Values to capture, in plain 
language, the principles we believe should apply 
when companies engage with consumer data.
These principles may evolve over time based on the 
needs of consumers, businesses and economies and  
to adapt to new privacy regulations and standards  
that may emerge. As Visa’s business moves into new 
technologies, payment flows and value-added services, 
we are committed to engaging with policymakers and 
regulators worldwide to participate in the development 
and harmonization of privacy regulations and standards.
28
Visa’s Data Values
Security
Individuals and businesses should have confidence 
that Visa payment data is safe. There is no higher 
priority for Visa than safeguarding those who use 
our products, services and network.
Control
Visa will always strive to provide simple 
explanations regarding how data may be  
used and to empower individuals with easy 
processes to manage use of their data.
Value
Data use at Visa should benefit individuals, 
businesses and economies. We strive to do this  
by delivering greater security, financial inclusion 
and consumer convenience.Fairness
Visa’s application of data and data-driven insights 
aims to be fair and inclusive, and avoid discrimination. 
Visa will strive to make our models explainable, 
accurate and safe.
Accountability
Visa’s approach to data use should be consistently 
applied at all levels of the organization and be 
embedded through process, training and 
management responsibilities.
2829Transaction Integrity
Visa is committed to ensuring the integrity of our 
payment system to maintain and enhance trust in Visa 
as the most secure way to pay. We do not tolerate the 
use of our network and products for illegal activity, and 
we are vigilant in our efforts to deter illegal activity on 
our network.
Visa’s Global Brand Protection Program manages 
situations where the Visa brand is associated with 
potentially illegal activities. As part of this program,  
Visa continued the following in 2020:
 Working with acquiring banks to identify and 
terminate merchants that are selling illegal items 
and services
 Identifying potentially illegal merchant activity via 
machine-learning solutions
 Supporting the U.S. Financial Coalition Against Child 
Exploitation and the U.S. based National Center for 
Missing & Exploited Children
 Combating counterfeiting and piracy in partnership 
with The International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition
Visa also responded to situations that developed 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as by partnering 
with government agencies to identify and address 
merchants offering fake and/or unapproved COVID-19 
cures, treatments and test kits online.
29Protecting  
the Planet 
30With many leaders viewing the COVID-19 pandemic 
as a preview of what the economic, social and 
environmental impacts could be if the world does 
not galvanize toward climate action, Visa remains 
committed to be among global corporate leaders  
in our efforts in this decisive decade of action. 
Our commitment begins with our continued efforts  
to minimize the environmental impact of our 
operations and activities “within Visa” — the footprint 
of our offices, data centers, business travel, employee 
commuting, procurement and other areas. While it  
is important to have begun our efforts here, Visa also 
seeks to be an engine of sustainable commerce. As a 
network connecting thousands of financial institutions, 
millions of merchants and billions of consumers, we 
are committed to using our products, services, 
network, expertise, brand and partnerships to inspire 
and empower sustainable living and support the 
global transition to a low-carbon economy.
Within Visa 
As a payments technology company, we organize 
our approach to managing environmental impacts 
within Visa into three focus areas: facilities/data 
centers, operations and employees. Considering 
the materiality of our impacts within these areas 
and how they interconnect allows Visa to prioritize 
and implement sustainability initiatives for different 
aspects of our business.

Green Bond
In 2020, Visa issued our inaugural green bond 
for $500 million, maturing in 2027. We are using 
the green bond, believed to be the first issued 
by a digital payments network, to finance 
projects including the construction and 
operation of highly efficient buildings, energy 
and water efficiency improvements, expanded 
use of renewable energy, employee commuter 
programs and initiatives focused on sustainable 
consumer behaviors. The proceeds also are 
anticipated to support investments in products 
and solutions to catalyze sustainable living in 
support of the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals.
31Facilities: Offices & Data Centers 
The responsible use of natural resources in the 
operation of Visa offices and data centers is a 
foundational part of our efforts to protect the planet. 
In 2020, Visa’s footprint included owning or leasing  
125 offices in 78 countries, most of which continued at 
least partial operations throughout 2020, as well as our 
global processing centers in the U.S., Singapore and 
the U.K. We work to reduce the environmental impact 
at our facilities and data centers by focusing on green 
building design, construction and operation, striving 
to obtain LEED or equivalent certifications for our 
buildings. At the end of 2020, approximately 71 
percent of Visa’s owned or leased square footage achieved or was pending LEED, BREEAM, Green Mark 
or other green building certification, and we will 
continue to use green building standards as we 
construct and renovate offices.
Visa’s data centers account for more than half of our 
total electricity consumption and are a focal point of 
our energy efficiency and water conservation efforts. 
We have achieved year-over-year improvements in  
our energy efficiency, measured by power usage 
effectiveness (PUE), as a result of programs such as 
upgrading our cooling and server equipment. We also 
have piloted and evaluated innovations like direct 
expansion, dry mode cooling and immersion cooling 
to improve our energy and/or water efficiency.

Sustainable Buildings  — Dubai Regional HQ
In alignment with our commitment to reduce the environmental footprint of our facilities, Visa is designing 
our new Central Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) regional headquarters building in Dubai in 
accordance with the Dubai Green Building Regulations (DGBR). We also are employing aspects of the “WELL 
Building Standard” in the design and construction of this project. The standards promote the consideration of 
sustainability and health benefits for occupants. Operations 
In addition to addressing the environmental impact from 
our facilities, we take a proactive approach to reducing 
the environmental footprint from Visa’s business activities, 
which we consider primarily to include purchased goods 
and services, corporate travel, food services and events. 
Our purchased goods and services are the largest source 
of Visa’s Scope 3 emissions, and we continue to engage 
our suppliers to better understand and manage the 
environmental footprint of our activities and to 
communicate our environmental objectives and 
expectations of our suppliers.
Our actions in 2020 included:
 Participating once again in the CDP Supply Chain 
Program to collect accurate and regular climate 
change and GHG emissions information from our key 
suppliers. We use the information gathered through 
the supplier questionnaires to identify areas for 
improvement and opportunities for partnership on 
emissions reduction strategies.
 Encouraging the use of videoconferencing 
technology to reduce the need for business travel. In 
2020, we expanded our offerings and capabilities in 
this area in response to our remote working situation.
 Developing initiatives to provide and promote green 
travel choices to employees, such as highlighting 
green-certified hotels, more efficient rental vehicles 
and options for rail travel. In addition, we continue to 
evaluate sustainable aviation fuels to reduce the 
emissions from our non-commercial air travel. In 2020, 
we developed a set of Visa Sustainable Travel guidelines 
to support employee decision-making by presenting 
options for sustainable transportation, accommodation 
and other topics related to travel. Through this effort, 
we aim to help employees understand and minimize 
the environmental impact of their business travel.
32 Bringing additional sustainable food options to the 
offices where we offer food service. Our “Waste Not” 
program is designed to encourage proper 
composting of food waste.
 Adding sustainability components to the events  
that Visa hosts for our clients and internal employee 
teams throughout the year. Our Green Meeting 
Guide, part of our Greening Our Events effort, 
includes recommendations on sustainable catering 
options and tips on hosting zero-waste events.
Employees
We are committed to empowering our 20,500 
employees around the world to be sustainability 
stewards in the workplace, at home and in their 
communities. In 2020, we continued and expanded 
our employee sustainability engagement initiatives.
In April 2020, we hosted a virtual Earth Week series of 
events and activities to celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of Earth Day. Throughout the week, we hosted 
activities, including Visa’s Sustainable Living Eco 
Challenges, a Sustainable Living Employee Survey  
and a virtual panel with the World Wildlife Fund. In 
response to employee engagement during Earth 
Week, Visa joined the Arbor Day Foundation to  
support the planting of 5,500 trees for efforts such  
as reforesting the Southern India’s Cauvery River  
Basin and Kenya’s Kijabe Forest. 
We also offer broader efforts to inspire and empower 
our employees to be champions of sustainable living.  
In 2020, as a significant number of our employees 
shifted to remote work, we adjusted these initiatives 
accordingly by offering webinars, emails, videos and 
chat sessions to share tips and suggestions for 
integrating sustainability into employees’ daily routines.As part of our efforts, we continue to identify, enable 
and encourage more sustainable commuting behavior 
among our employees. 
Additional programs include the following:
 Shuttles:  we offer employee shuttles between 
nearby public transit hubs and other offices at  
many of our facilities around the world.  Public transit : we encourage employees to use 
public transportation by offering transit fare 
subsidies in select offices. 
 EV chargers:  we provide access to more than 140 
electric vehicle chargers spanning 19 of our offices 
and facilities.
33Our Results
Since 2008 and with support from leading third-party 
environmental firms, Visa has conducted an annual 
global environmental footprint assessment to measure 
our global energy and water use, waste production, 
landfill diversion and GHG emissions. 
Energy 
In 2020, we continued our commitment to improve 
our energy efficiency and procure renewable energy.
We used approximately 706,000 gigajoules (GJ) of 
energy from electricity, natural gas and other fuels.  
This represents a 5 percent decrease in consumption 
compared to 2019.
Our energy intensity per square foot, a commonly 
used metric that adjusts for growth, improved by 9 
percent year-over-year, representing six consecutive 
years of improvement. We acknowledge that this  
year’s measured energy use was impacted in part by 
COVID-19 and the shift to a remote work environment 
for a majority of Visa’s employees.
100% Renewable Electricity 
As we began 2020, we announced the achievement of 
our goal to transition to using 100 percent renewable 
electricity. We are proud of this accomplishment, yet 
also continue to pursue opportunities to contribute  
to additional renewable electricity generation through 
utility providers and external renewable energy 
suppliers and partners. Visa continues to champion  
the overall corporate renewable energy movement, 
including through our support of the Renewable 
Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA).Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Since 2009, we have used international standards,  
such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol of the World 
Resources Institute and the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development, to measure and report the 
GHG emissions associated primarily with our energy 
usage, business travel and employee commuting. In 
2019, we expanded our approach to measure and 
report on all Scope 3 emissions, including purchased 
goods and services. 
In 2020, our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, measured in 
absolute terms with a market-based approach, were 13,900 
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2 e). This 
represents a 77 percent decrease year-over-year from 
2019. The decrease in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions is 
largely due to the achievement of our goal to transition 
to 100 percent renewable electricity. 
In 2020, we also: 
 Responded once again to the CDP Climate Change 
questionnaire and received an A- score — a year-
over-year improvement. Visa’s CDP response is 
available on the CDP website.
 Obtained independent verification of our energy 
and emissions data. 
 In carbon intensity, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions saw 
significant improvements in 2020 vs 2019: 
 -Decreased 77 percent per employee
 -Decreased 78 percent per square foot of space
 -Decreased 76 percent per dollar revenue
 -Decreased 77 percent per transaction processed
 
In 2020, we achieved carbon neutrality across our 
operations for the first time. This achievement, which 
includes the footprint from our Scope 1, Scope 2 and employee commuting/business travel components of 
Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, is the result of 
ongoing energy efficiency initiatives, our transition to 
100% renewable electricity and limited use of carbon 
offsets to cover our residual footprint. Our carbon offsets 
portfolio includes projects spanning our geographic 
regions, such as forest preservation in the U.S. and 
Canada, reforestation in Brazil, renewable energy in 
Turkey and clean cookstoves in India and Uganda.
Water
Visa recognizes and respects the importance of 
protecting water as a shared resource. Though our 
business is not water intensive, we work to reduce  
the total water consumption at our offices and data 
centers by implementing data-driven efficiency efforts. 
Globally in 2020, we used an estimated 57,100,000 
gallons of potable water. Of the total potable water 
use, 83 percent occurred in the United States and 
Canada, 9 percent in Europe and the remainder 
occurring elsewhere. By facility type, 81 percent of 
potable water use occurred in our offices, while 19 
percent occurred in our data centers, where we use  
a significant amount of reclaimed water. Most of our 
potable water use occurs in offices, and we largely 
attribute our 14 percent potable water usage decrease 
year-over-year to office closures.
Waste Reduction & Diversion 
While not a major producer of solid waste, we 
continue to work to reduce the amount of office waste 
we dispose of in landfills. Reducing waste streams at 
our facilities is a particular focus of our global Green 
Teams, which collaborate to engage employees, 
increase recycling rates and incorporate more reusable 
and compostable materials in the office. In 2020, we 
achieved a landfill diversion rate of 54 percent.

We believe that we have the opportunity to leverage 
our role in commerce to help inspire and empower 
sustainable living and support the global transition  
to a low-carbon, sustainable economy. Our approach 
focuses on: 
 Insights:  understanding and sharing knowledge 
about the drivers of sustainable living
 Impact:  embedding sustainability in payment 
accounts to empower consumers and others  
to understand and address their impact
 Verticals:  using our resources to support  
solutions in verticals and remove friction from 
sustainable behaviors
 Movement:  helping build the sustainable 
commerce movement 
Insights 
We conduct consumer research, as well as support 
organizations working to understand the barriers and 
drivers of sustainable commerce and living. In 2020,  
for the second year, Visa participated as a design 
partner in the Healthy and Sustainable Living Study 
conducted by GlobeScan. The study focused on 
attitudes, opinions and behaviors linked to more 
sustainable and healthier lifestyles and reached 27,000 
consumers spanning 27 markets. Visa has used the 
survey findings to drive continued development of 
solutions for and communication to consumers. Impact 
As a global payments network, we believe that we  
can play an important role in helping consumers 
understand and act on their individual environmental 
impact. In 2020, Visa launched the Fintech Partner 
Connect program to equip our financial institution and 
merchant clients with enhanced capabilities and access 
to innovative fintech solutions. As part of the launch, 
Visa announced our inaugural fintech partner, Ecolytiq, 
for the Sustainable Banking pillar of the program. 
Ecolytiq’s solution analyzes payment transactions in 
real-time to calculate carbon dioxide (CO2) footprints  
on an individual level, helping consumers understand 
their ecological impact, change their behavior and 
offset their carbon footprint. 
In addition to embedding sustainability in payment 
accounts, Visa also is reducing the impact of the 
physical payment card itself. In 2020, Visa and CPI Card 
Group jointly announced the launch of the Earthwise 
payment card composed of up to 98 percent upcycled 
plastic. We also supported our clients in implementing 
other payment card options with sustainability 
attributes, including recycled PVC, biomass and 
recovered ocean-bound plastics. 
Verticals 
Visa works to support initiatives and bring solutions to 
advance sustainability and climate action in particular 
vertical sectors. Our efforts have focused on travel, 
tourism and mobility.Travel & Tourism 
In 2020, Visa continued our role as a founding partner 
in Travalyst, a sustainable travel and tourism initiative, 
founded by the Duke of Sussex together with 
Skyscanner, Booking.com, Trip.com Group and 
Tripadvisor. The Travalyst initiative is working with  
the travel and tourism industry to create a more 
sustainable future for destinations, communities  
and travelers alike. In response to the impacts of the 
pandemic on global travel in 2020, the efforts of 
Travalyst have focused on building sustainability 
scoring frameworks in key areas of travel, as well as on 
helping travel/tourism-related small businesses and 
their local communities recover as travel resumes. 
In 2020, Visa also supported the sustainability-related 
efforts of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in travel 
and tourism, including our Chief Sustainability Officer’s 
participation in the WEF Global Future Council on 
Sustainable Tourism. The Council is evaluating the 
conditions necessary for the success of business 
models that hold sustainability as a core value, 
exploring the development of industry-wide metrics 
and considering how technology can be harnessed  
to support the transition to a clean, safe and inclusive 
tourism industry. 
36Mobility 
In cities around the world, administrators and urban 
planners are testing new approaches to make 
transportation systems more environmentally 
sustainable and logistically efficient. GHG emissions 
from transport are on track to double by 2050, and 
already passenger vehicles account for 70 percent of 
those emissions and 50 percent of urban air pollution. 
Visa is working to bring digital payments to citizens’ 
door-to-door journeys, including to support more 
sustainable ways to move and to reduce emissions  
and address climate change. 
Visa's Global Urban Mobility team seeks to help 
remove friction from taking public transit by 
partnering with cities to integrate contactless  
travel solutions worldwide. In 2020, Visa launched 
programs in 60 new cities and partnered with Cubic 
Transportation Systems, a transport technology 
company, to offer contactless payments throughout 
the world, including in London, Miami, New York, 
Sydney and Vancouver. In total, Visa’s contactless 
solutions are in more than 400 cities worldwide. 
In 2020, we also announced a new partnership with  
the Global Resilient Cities Network (GRCN) to help 
deploy technologies that can build and further digital 
economies across 17 Latin American and Caribbean 
cities. Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, GRCN 
will help cities become more resilient to the physical, 
social and economic challenges of the 21st century. The 
collaboration between Visa and GRCN will support cities 
to develop the right digital infrastructure as part of their 
resilience strategy, with a special focus on urban 
mobility as a catalyst to accelerate these changes. Movement 
Visa also remains committed to helping build and 
support the overall sustainable living movement. In 
2020, Visa continued to serve as a Founding Partner  
of and participant in Brands for Good, an initiative of 
Sustainable Brands focused on building a movement 
among leading brands to make sustainable living 
more attractive, rewarding and attainable. In line  
with that objective, in 2020 Visa also served as the 
presenting sponsor of the Netflix Down to Earth with 
Zac Efron  series, a travel show that explores healthy, 
sustainable ways to live.
Policy Engagement
As part of our environmental sustainability and climate action commitments, we recognize the importance of 
corporate participation in the public policy dialogue on climate. In 2020, we expanded our own participation 
in climate and environmental policy, such as through the following: 
 Supported the development and release of the Business Roundtable’s Addressing Climate Change: Principles 
and Policies  statement. Developed by the organization’s Climate Working Group, of which Visa was a member, 
the statement calls for a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to addressing climate change. This 
approach includes enhanced international cooperation and diplomacy, as well as market-based mechanisms 
such as setting a price on carbon in order to reduce GHG emissions in the United States by 80 percent by 
2050, while keeping global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. 
 Participated in the LEAD on Climate 2020 U.S. Congressional advocacy day. The event, organized by CERES 
and other members of the We Mean Business and We Are Still In coalitions, garnered support from more 
than 300 other companies in calling for a “build back better” strategy recognizing a need for a resilient, clean

37Operating 
Responsibly
38Corporate Governance 
Visa’s governance practices help promote long-term 
value, as well as strong Board and management 
accountability to our shareholders, clients and other 
stakeholders. Our Board of Directors oversees and 
monitors important governance issues, including  
Board independence, Board composition and 
refreshment, executive and Board compensation,  
as well as succession planning. 
In 2020, the Board modified its policies and practices  
 in order to quickly meet the challenges posed by  
the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board held several  
virtual meetings and received regular updates from 
management on the shifts in business and financial 
performance. In addition, the Board adopted emergency 
bylaw provisions that allow it to act, if necessary, during  
a crisis, even if a quorum of the Board cannot readily 
convene. To enhance transparency throughout the  
year, Visa management also increased the frequency  
of reporting on business and operational results.
Board & Committee Structure
Our current Board committees include Audit and Risk, 
Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Corporate 
Governance. All four Board committees are composed 
solely of independent directors.
Visa’s Board of Directors is a 12-member board with 
11 independent members. Al Kelly serves as our Chief 
Executive Officer and Chair of the Board, and John 
Lundgren serves as our Lead Independent Director, 
responsible for providing independent leadership to the 
Board. Linda J. Rendle joined the Visa Board as a director 
in November 2020.
We limit our directors to serving on four publicly-traded 
company boards (the limit is two for CEOs and executive 
officers of publicly traded companies). The Nominating 
and Corporate Governance Committee may grant 
exceptions to established limits on a case-by-case 
basis. To best serve our shareholders, employees and 
customers, the Board periodically reviews and evaluates 
its internal leadership structure and Lead Independent 
Director responsibilities.
Board Diversity
The Board strives to reflect the diversity of our key 
constituencies around the world, including our 
clients, customers, employees, business partners and 
stockholders. To continue to promote a mix of board 
diversity, experience and perspectives, Visa’s Board is 
committed to including women and racially diverse 
candidates from underrepresented communities in all 
director search pools.As of 2021, Visa’s overall board diversity is at 58%  
and gender diversity at 33%, placing us in compliance 
with new California regulations in advance of their 
effective date. 
The Board strives to reflect 
the diversity of our key 
constituencies around the 
world and is committed to 
including women and 
racially diverse candidates 
from underrepresented 
communities in all director 
search pools.
39Board & Executive Compensation 
Programs & Philosophy 
Visa recognizes that environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) practices are important elements of 
long-term corporate strategy and contribute to Visa being 
a sustainable and responsible corporate citizen. In 2020, 
as part of our annual incentive plan, the Compensation 
Committee measured individual performance of Visa’s 
executive officers against pre-established goals that 
were designed to align with our strategic objectives. 
These goals included the following ESG factors: inclusion 
and diversity; employee leadership and development; 
employee health, safety, productivity, and engagement; 
cybersecurity and data privacy; financial inclusion and 
access; and corporate governance. In addition, we 
consider individual performance, which is tied to our 
strategic objectives, including relevant ESG factors, when 
setting the value of the officers’ long-term equity award.
In addition, the Compensation Committee will use  
ESG considerations, among other factors that align  
with our strategy, to determine FY21 bonus funding  
for all employees.
Shareholder Engagement 
Our Board and management team value the opinions 
and feedback of our shareholders, and we are committed 
to proactive, ongoing engagement with our shareholders 
throughout the year. In 2020, in addition to regular 
interaction of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer and Investor Relations team with investors, we 
contacted our top 50 investors, representing more than 
61 percent of our outstanding Class A common stock, 
with an opportunity to discuss Visa’s ESG performance. 
We held telephonic meetings with 37 institutional 
shareholders representing approximately 42 percent  
of our outstanding Class A common stock.

40Ethics & Compliance
Trust underlies everything we do at Visa. We maintain 
the trust of our stakeholders in part through instilling  
a culture of honesty and integrity, in which we hold 
ourselves to the highest ethical standards and strive to 
continuously strengthen our ethics and compliance 
program. Our commitment to ethics and compliance 
is captured in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
(Code), which applies to everyone working with or on 
behalf of Visa, including employees, contingent staff, 
vendors and the Board of Directors.
In 2020, Visa reinforced its commitment to ethical 
operations amidst a global pandemic and the resulting 
transition to a primarily virtual business environment. 
We built and strengthened internal partnerships to 
embed ethics and compliance into enterprise-wide 
management process and business leader 
performance scorecards.
In addition, we invested in new training and more 
frequent communications, targeting potential issues 
posed by the virtual work environment. Training and 
communication enhancements included: 
 A “Speak Up” Campaign to empower employees to 
report misconduct 
 An updated Global Ethical Manager Toolkit to help 
leaders discuss ethics with teams 
 Tailored compliance reference guides for specific 
programs and regions
 A revised Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
training to improve employee knowledge and 
retention of content, achieving a 100% completion 
rate for all eligible Visa employeesIn addition, Visa scored highly on an industry-standard 
self-assessment, which measures an organization’s 
performance relative to Gartner’s best practice 
benchmarking standards.
We also continued to innovate, despite the external 
challenges. In 2020, Visa received a U.S. patent for 
developing a peer group data modeling technique. The 
technique classifies participants in the Visa ecosystem 
based on characteristics and payment activity trends with respect to certain anti-money laundering risk 
factors, allowing us to monitor payment transactions 
for suspicious activities effectively and efficiently.
Our commitment to ethics and compliance has 
continued to receive external recognition. In early 
2021, Visa was named to the World’s Most Ethical 
Companies list by Ethisphere Institute for the ninth 
consecutive year. In addition, Visa received the Best 
Compliance and Ethics Program (large cap) Award 
from Corporate Secretary magazine for the third time. Visa has been named to the World’s Most Ethical 
Companies list for the ninth consecutive year.
41Engaging with 
Governments 
Visa actively engages with governments, officials, 
policymakers, and stakeholders across the world to 
help shape the future of digital payments. Through  
our partnerships, we foster innovation and find 
opportunities to drive digital transformation and 
further enable access to financial services.
In 2020, Visa collaborated with governments to help 
empower people, economies and communities, 
including in the following ways:
 Supporting emergency disbursements  
during COVID-19
 Expanding contactless payments around the world
 Launching the Visa Economic Empowerment 
Institute, committed to promoting and advancing 
equitable economic empowerment of individuals, 
businesses and societies around the worldOur commitment to 
transparency in political 
disclosures once again 
earned us the “Trendsetter” 
status on the 2020 CPA-
Zicklin Index of Corporate 
Political Disclosure and 
Accountability.
Global Partnerships 
Visa contributes its expertise in digital payments to 
help government partners advance their development 
goals. For example, we are supporting the government 
of Japan in doubling the percentage of payments 
made digitally to 40 percent by 2025.
In addition to collaborating with governments, Visa 
commits to strategic partnerships with multilateral 
organizations and regional development banks to help 
develop markets and build small business resilience 
through digital payments. Continuing partnerships 
include those with the World Bank, United Nations 
Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) and the World 
Economic Forum (WEF). 
Through Visa University, we also provide training and 
outreach programs to governments and policymakers 
around the world to allow us to foster the exchange of 
ideas on legal and economic aspects of digital financial 
services. In 2020, we trained hundreds of participants 
through these efforts.In addition, we continued the following practices in 2020: 
 Publishing our annual Visa Inc. Corporate Political 
Contributions Report, including our listing of all U.S. 
trade associations to which Visa pays annual 
membership dues that are $25,000 or more, and, if 
applicable, the portion of dues that we use for 
political contributions, as well as any corporate 
state-level contributions.
 In the United States, disclosing all contributions 
made by Visa’s Political Action Committee (PAC), in 
accordance with the requirements of the Federal 
Election Commission. 
Visa’s Approach to  
Tax Compliance  
& Governance
Visa operates globally and seeks to comply with 
applicable laws, regulations and requirements, 
including those related to tax, around the world.
Visa’s statement on tax compliance and 
governance covers the following aspects  
of our approach:
 Board and Executive oversight
 Management 
 Adherence to tax laws
 Stakeholder engagement
This statement is available at  
visa.com/responsibility
42Responsible Sourcing 
Beyond Visa operations, our commitment to operate 
responsibly and sustainably extends to our suppliers 
and business partners.
Our global Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code) 
outlines our expectations in areas including human 
rights, employment practices, environmental impact, 
supplier diversity, conflicts of interest and other aspects 
of responsible business. We reference the Supplier Code 
in our global Governing Agreements with suppliers and 
in our Global Sourcing Policy, and send the Supplier 
Code to all new suppliers during their onboarding 
process. In 2020, we continued implementation of the 
Supplier Code and focused on maintaining our supplier 
relationships throughout the pandemic. 
Supplier Diversity
Visa recognizes that a supply chain composed of 
diverse suppliers promotes competition and quality 
from our vendors, drives innovation and helps us 
better reflect the diversity of our customers. We are 
proud to work with a range of diverse suppliers, 
including Minority-owned businesses; Women-owned 
businesses; Disabled-owned businesses; Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual and Transgender-owned (LGBT) businesses; 
Disabled Veteran-owned businesses; Small, Certified 
HUBZone businesses; and Small businesses. 
As part of Visa’s expanded actions in support of  
racial and social justice announced in 2020, Visa 
committed to incorporate the following into our 
procurement practices:
 Requesting diverse account teams for preferred 
suppliers and partners
 Increasing the number of diverse suppliers in our 
network — thereby increasing Visa spend with 
diverse suppliers
 Requiring diverse sourcing options for spend across 
Requests for Proposals (RFPs) - directly with our 
suppliers or indirectly through their suppliers 
In 2020, through our efforts to increase diversity in our 
supply chain, we accomplished the following in our 
North America operations:
 Approximately doubled the number of diverse 
suppliers in the Visa network 
 Strongly encourage our prime suppliers to 
participate in our Supplier Diversity Program by 
establishing relationships with, and committing  
a percentage of expenditures to, diverse vendors Implemented a system to track Visa spend with 
diverse Tier II suppliers 
 Began incorporating inclusion and diversity 
provisions into all new sourcing agreements
 Began establishing similar programs across our 
global footprint 
Environmental Impact
Visa also has expanded its engagement with its  
top suppliers around climate change and other 
environmental issues. In 2020, Visa once again 
participated in the CDP Supply Chain program, 
through which Visa engages its suppliers on their 
management and reporting of climate change impact.  
43Centre for Sport & Human Rights
Visa remains a proud founding supporter and Advisory Council member of the Centre for Sport and Human 
Rights (CSHR). Considering the pandemic and its impact on sport, the Centre focused its work in 2020 on 
providing human rights-related guidance for the sport community on COVID-19, scaling efforts to protect  
child rights in sport, hosting digitally-enabled content and events on topics such as athlete activism, and the 
establishment of new working groups, such as on Mega-Sporting Events.  
Human Rights
At Visa, we recognize our responsibility to respect, 
advance and maintain global human rights standards 
across our company, operations and supply chain.
Our approach to respecting human rights in our 
business activities continues to be informed by 
international frameworks, including:
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights
 International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration 
on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work
Visa's cross-functional Human Rights Working Group 
(HRWG) oversees our overall approach, including  
our risk identification, mitigation and due diligence 
strategy. The HRWG — through the Visa ESG and 
Sustainability team — shares progress with members  of the Visa executive team and Board of Directors on a 
regular basis, with the Board’s Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee providing human rights 
oversight as part of its overarching ESG responsibility.
In 2020, Visa held its inaugural recognition of 
International Human Rights Day in order to raise 
awareness and share our commitments with our 
global workforce. The day marked a recognition of  
the “inherent, inalienable” basic human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of all human beings, including 
the basic concepts of dignity, liberty and equality.
In 2020, we also completed our triennial Human Rights 
Impact Assessment — our global review of salient 
human rights risks resulting from our operations, 
network, supply chain, partnerships and sponsorships 
conducted in accordance with the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
Informed by our assessments, our human rights 
strategy focuses on mitigating risks emanating from 
our role in four areas:
An Employer 
We acknowledge and respect the human rights of each 
employee. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
outlines our employee protections and freedoms, 
including: privacy, expression, association and maintaining a workplace safe from retaliation. Policies 
contributing to the respect of human rights of our 
employees include: Harassment and Discrimination 
Policy; Safety, Health and Environmental Policy; 
Whistleblower Policy and Non-Retaliation Policy.
A Purchaser
Our Visa Supplier Code of Conduct outlines our 
expectations for suppliers including the respect  
of human rights. 
An E-Payments Enabler
As financial crimes can support and contribute to 
human rights abuses such as human trafficking,  
we are committed to preventing illegal activities  
on our network. 
A Business Partner & Sponsor
We incorporate respect for human rights into  
the expectations of and engagement with our 
partnerships and sponsorships, including issues  
at the intersection of sport and human rights.
In early 2021, we published our fifth UK Modern 
Slavery Act transparency statement,  highlighting 
our efforts in FY20 to help ensure slavery and human 
trafficking are not taking place in our business and 
across our supply chain.
