2ESG Strategy & Goals
2As a purpose-driven company, how we deliver enduring impact is embedded in our business 
strategy through execution of our ESG strategy, which frames our ambitions, informs our execution, 
and creates accountability for our vision of the future. 
At the most senior level, our Board of Directors oversees the implementation by management of 
our ESG strategy to promote responsible business practices through a culture of integrity and 
accountable leadership across our company. 
We focus our efforts on the areas where we are uniquely positioned to achieve the greatest impact 
– championing global health equity, empowering our employees, and advancing environmental 
health. Leading with accountability and innovation is foundational to these efforts and essential to 
achieving Our Purpose, creating a virtuous circle that creates economic, environmental, and social 
value for all those we serve. 
We will help achieve better health outcomes for patients and healthcare providers, foster rewarding 
opportunities for our employees and suppliers, protect and strengthen the communities in which 
we live and work, and provide profitable, sustainable growth for investors. Our Credo values drive us to achieve Our Purpose to change the trajectory 
of health for humanity and ground our business strategy, reflecting our  
long-held belief that creating societal value is inextricably linked with 
generating long-term business value.  
Through our enterprise principles and our global growth drivers we enable 
our continued growth and performance against our environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) strategy.Our

ESG Strategy & Goals
3Health for Humanity 2025 Goals 
In 2021, we launched our ambitious set of Health for Humanity 2025 Goals that align to our ESG 
focus areas and foundation of accountability and innovation and show how we hold ourselves 
publicly accountable in creating a more sustainable society. Through our Health for Humanity 
Goals, we directly support 11 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  
ESG Priorities 
To identify, prioritize and strategically address environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
topics that can have material impact on society or our business, Johnson & Johnson conducts 
ESG materiality assessments (Priority Topics Assessments—PTAs) every two to three years or 
as needed. In 2021, we conducted a PTA with the aim of improving alignment with the evolving 
needs of stakeholders against an updated list of ESG priority topics. We applied a “double 
materiality” focus, in which we examined ESG priority topics from two standpoints: the impact 
of a topic on Johnson & Johnson’s business results and the impact of Johnson & Johnson’s 
business on people, the environment and society. The highest priority topics were the same as 
in previous PTAs: consumer health and patient safety; product quality; access; and advancing 
public health. The insights and data generated from the 2021 PTA informed our ESG strategy.  
Sustainability Governance 
The Johnson & Johnson Enterprise Governance Council (EGC) is the primary governance 
body for ESG topics and implementation of the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework. The EGC is composed of senior leaders who represent our Pharmaceutical, 
MedTech and Consumer Health business segments and our global Enterprise functions. In 
2021, the EGC oversaw our PTA update, ESG strategy development and Health for Humanity 
2025 Goals progress, and engaged regularly with teams across the Company on core ESG-
driven initiatives such as Our Race to Health Equity. Members of the Executive Committee were 
engaged in advancing ESG through supporting ESG strategy development, risk management 
and sponsorship of priority ESG topics. The Board of Directors and its Committees provided 
oversight on specific ESG topics throughout the year.2021 Priority Topics Matrix

Environment Best Practices in 2021
•  Added new on-site solar arrays at our facilities in China, Colombia, South Africa and Thailand. 
•  Introduced on-site Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) structure in the form of multiyear “energy as a service” contracts at two sites, enabling GHG 
reduction benefits without capital investment. 
•     Reduced carbon impact of logistics with new automated 3D freight loading plan that optimizes space utilization of shipping containers and reduced 
road distances traveled in Europe through distribution center routing optimization. 
•  Advanced product end-of-life initiatives across Pharmaceutical and MedTech with product take-back, reprocessing and/or recycling programs. For 
example, we relaunched our SAFE RETURNS program in the U.S. for home-administered immunology products after removing the hazardous material 
classification and replacing containers with regular envelopes, enabling more convenient preparation and postage. 
•  Improved packaging sustainability across several products, increasing recycled content and recyclability. For example, we replaced plastic trays for 
TREMFYA (guselkumab) with Pulp Injection Molding trays and reduced primary packaging weight across several MedTech products.

Our operational (Scope 1+2) GHG emissions goal is 
validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) 
as being consistent with the reductions required to 
keep global warming to 1.5°C. Our operational carbon 
neutrality goal goes beyond what the latest climate science 
deems necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Climate 
Agreement. Our value chain (Scope 3) goal is validated by 
SBTi as being consistent with a 2°C reduction scenario.
