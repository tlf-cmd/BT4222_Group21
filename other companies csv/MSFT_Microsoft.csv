,,,"To date, more than 75 countries, 700+ companies, and more than 400 civil society organizations have signed on to commitments.",
,,,"We deepened our engagement with civil society by funding the CyberPeace Institute, a Geneva based nonprofit focused on stability of cyberspace and support to communities that are most vulnerable online.",

,,,"Microsoft also continued to drive industry action through the Cybersecurity Technology Accord, including helping recruit over 140 global technology companies to sign the Accord and advance online security and resiliency worldwide.",
,,,"Generating insights that fuel security Microsoft analyzes more than 8 trillion signals daily and processes 630 billion identity transactions and scans 470 billion emails for malware and phishing each month, generating insights that fuel security innovation for our customers.",
,,,"We use these learnings and leverage them for increased protection against sophisticated cyber threats.Promoting community approach to cybersecurity is critical This year we released a new annual report, the Digital Defense R eport.",
,,,"In analyzing cybersecurity trends over a period of time, we can help strengthen the digital defense of Microsoft and our customers, using a combination of technology, operations, legal action and policy to disrupt and deter malicious activity.",
,,,"One example of this approach is our investment in sophisticated campaign clustering intelligence in Microsoft 365, which enables security operations center (SOC) teams to piece together these increasingly complex campaigns from their fragments.",
,,,We are also trying to make it more difficult for malicious actors to operate online by disrupting their activities through legal action.,
,,,"By proactively seizing their malicious infrastructure, the bad actors lose visibility, capability and access across a range of assets previously under their control, forcing them to rebuild.",

,,,Highlights Countering online child sexual exploitation and abuse We remain resolute in our commitment to countering online child sexual exploitation and abuse.,
,,,"In line with that commitment, this year we have undertaken a range of activities built on new principles, partnerships, and technology approaches.",
,,,A few examples of these activities include: • Endorsing the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse through our active participation in groups such as WePROTECT Global Alliance and the Technology Coalition with whom we continue to develop new technology and partnerships to support this collective work.,
,,,"• Joining leading technology companies in announcing Project Protect, a strategic vision for the future of the Technology Coalition focusing on technology innovation, collective action, independent research, information and knowledge sharing, transparency, and accountability to combat Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.",

,,,"Developed in collaboration with The Meet Group, Roblox, and Kik and Thorn, this technique builds off Microsoft-patented technology and is freely available to qualified online service companies that offer a chat function.",
,,,Combating terrorism and violent extremism online We continue to take steps to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content when it appears on our hosted consumer services.,
,,,"We invest in collaborative efforts and partnerships with others who are working to stem the broader issue of violent extremism, including being a leading proponent for the creation of The Christchurch Call, an initiative that brings together members of the technology sector, governments, and civil society to prevent technology from being used to promote terrorism and violent extremism online.",
,,,"W e were also one of the founding member companies of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), whose mission is to prevent terrorists and violent extremists from exploiting digital platforms.",

,,,"Microsoft’s Office of R esponsible AI is creating the internal governance across our engineering and product teams needed to turn our AI principles into practices, as well as using our voice to advocate for change.",
,,,"For example, facial recognition can help find a missing child or speed up border crossings, but misuse or bias in datasets can also lead to human rights abuses or civil liberties violations.",
,,,That’s why Microsoft established our own internal principles to guide the development of our facial recognition technology.,
,,,"To help our customers build and use the technology responsibly and get the best results, we developed a Transparency Note for Face API to disclose the limitations and capabilities of our technology.",
,,,The Face API Transparency Note proved so helpful that we’re now underway with preparing similar documentation for other products to ensure our customers fully understand their capabilities and limitations.,
,,,"On the public policy front, Microsoft’s call for government regulations on the use of facial recognition helped kick off a national conversation around the use of facial recognition.",
,,,Earlier this year we were happy to applaud Washington State when it became the first state to establish detailed safeguards on how the technology should be used.,
,,,"The law put in place testing requirements, established transparency and accountability mechanisms, and offers protections for civil liberties.",
,,,W e view the law as a good first step and a model for other states or Congress to adopt.,
,,,"To build on this work, earlier this year, Microsoft also confirmed that we would not sell our facial recognition technology to police departments in the United States until there is a strong law, grounded in human rights, that establishes appropriate safeguards.",
,,,"We know how challenging this work can be, and we’re committed to sharing what we learn so that others can adopt the practices, tools, and guidelines that we develop.",
,,,W e launched a Responsible AI Resources Center to make them widely available.,
