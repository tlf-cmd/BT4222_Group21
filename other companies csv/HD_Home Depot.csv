"• Off-site solar: Last year, we signed on with a community solar provider in Minnesota, expanding our support of similar initiatives in Delaware and Massachusetts.• On-site solar: We started 2017 with four operational rooftop solar farms.",,,,
"By the end of the year, we had launched 34 new projects and obtained permits for three more.",,,,
(See our spotlight on the next page for details.),,,,
• Fuel cells: We cut polluting emissions signi/f_i cantly — in some cases by 50% — when our stores use fuel cells instead of traditional power sources.,,,,
"These mini power plants were installed outside 178 THD stores by the end of 2017, producing roughly 90% of the electricity needs of each store.",,,,
Fuel cells are a good option for stores with aging roofs that will need to be replaced within 15 years; that’s how long a rooftop solar project needs to stay in place to yield an appropriate return on investment.,,,,
More fuel cell installations are underway at stores in 2018.,,,,
Check out an interactive infographic highlighting energy-saving and other sustainability enhancements we’re using in some stores.,,,,
"SMART ENERGY USE67 2018 Responsibility ReportLong-term Savings We continue to bene/f_it from previous years’ investments, such as: • Installing upgraded building automation systems in all U.S. and Canadian stores in 2013 and 2014 • Retro/f_itting lighting in more than 1,300 stores, converting from 6- to 4-lamp /f_ixtures • Installing variable frequency drives (VFDs) in more than 600 stores to ensure motorized equipment only uses the electricity needed to meet immediate demandsSpotlight: Powering up the big box with sunshine The average Home Depot store is about 104,000 square feet, meaning there’s more than a soccer /f_ield of space on the roof of each one.",,,,
"In 2017, we launched projects to transfrom 34 of those rooftops into solar farms.",,,,
"By the end of the year, 38 stores in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were capturing energy from the sun.",,,,
These zero-emissions solar farms reduce each store’s annual electricity grid demand by an estimated 30-35%.,,,,
"That’s the equivalent of powering 2,300 average U.S. homes for a year.",,,,
Permitting slowdowns delayed some installations planned in 2017; these projects continue in 2018.,,,,
The goal is to have sun-fueled power plants atop more than 50 stores.,,,,

,"In 2018, electricity consumption by our U.S. stores was 26% less than in 2010.",,,
,"That put us ahead of our stated 2020 goal to achieve a 20% reduction in store kilowatt hour energy use, compared to 2010 consumption.",,,
,"In 2018 alone, U.S. store energy consumption dropped 2.9%.",,,

,"We learned from those improvements, and in 2018, we installed even more efficient LED lights above the aisles and garden centers of 295 stores.",,,
,The energy- saving results so far have been impressive.,,,
,We’re collecting additional data in 2019 as we expand LEDs to more stores.We continue to benefit from earlier initiatives to install upgraded building automation systems in all U.S. and Canadian stores and add variable frequency drives (VFDs) to more than 600 stores.,,,
,VFDs conserve energy by ensuring equipment uses only the electricity needed to meet immediate HVAC demands.,,,
,Balancing Energy Supply and Demand More than 750 stores participate in demand mitigation to help balance power supply and demand.,,,
,"Here’s how it works: During peak demand, utilities or grid operators strategically divert electricity from some of our stores, reducing the chance of regional outages and optimizing the price we pay for electricity.",,,
,"In addition, we use on-site batteries to store electricity during off-peak times for use when demand rises.",,,
,"At the end of 2018, batteries were in place at 10 stores in California.",,,

,,,,"FAQ: CONTINUING THE MOMENTUM Our investments to reduce The Home Depot’s environmental impact yielded results in 2019, and that progress continues.How does The Home Depot measure its impact on the climate, and what progress did the company make in 2019?"
,,,,"We track our carbon dioxide emissions from distribution, store energy use and more, using metrics that are industry standards: • Scope 1: Direct emissions from combustible sources and refrigerants • Scope 2: Indirect emissions from purchasing electricity • Scope 3: Emissions from upstream transportation and distribution of freight We reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 10% and Scope 3 emissions 1% in 2019, compared to the year before."
,,,,We remain committed to future progress.
,,,,"The Home Depot has pledged to reduce CO2 emissions 2.1% per year, with the ultimate goal of achieving a 50% reduction by 2035.What’s driving improvement?"
,,,,"We’re reducing our carbon footprint in many ways, but changes in the way we distribute goods and use energy are yielding some of our biggest results."
,,,,"For example, by packing trailers in ways that maximized available space, we were able to avoid sending about 10,500 truckloads of products on the road — saving 15 million driven miles in 2019."
,,,,"Our U.S. stores reduced electricity consumption by 383 million kilowatt hours, a decrease of 12% year over year."

,,,,"To help protect endangered forests and to ensure that there will be timber for future generations, The Home Depot first issued our Wood Purchasing Policy in 1999."
,,,,Since then we have successfully led our suppliers toward understanding and practicing sustainable forestry throughout the world.
,,,,"Today, we have broadened our focus to understand the impact of our wood purchases in all regions and to embrace the social and economic issues that must be considered in recognizing endangered regions of forests."
,,,,Building on the Journey Our research has taught us much about the world’s forest coverage by country.
,,,,This helps guide our supply chain decisions.
,,,,The vast majority of our wood product purchases originate from North American forests.
,,,,These are some of the most sustainable forests in the world.
,,,,"The United States now grows more trees for wood than at any time in the last 60 years, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture."
,,,,"We track our wood purchases in all departments, from lumber to tool handles, to help protect forests and ensure future availability of timber."

,,,,"Last year’s conference was packed with educational sessions and thought- provoking speeches from green-building boosters, community organizers and even former U.S. President Barack Obama."
,,,,"Here are three themes that emerged from the four-day event, and how they’re already integrated into our business."
,,,,Collaboration Partnerships are pivotal to advancing green initiatives across our industry.
,,,,At The Home Depot that takes many forms.
,,,,"We work with suppliers on initiatives as varied as reducing plastics in products, offering wood products from sustainable sources and improving distribution efficiencies to conserve fuel.TPriorities that emerged from the world’s largest sustainable-building conference are already shaping how we do business.GREENBUILD COMES TO ATLANTA Greener Products Consumers’ standards are higher than ever when it comes to understanding where their products are coming from, what’s in them and how they are produced."
,,,,"That’s the motivation for our Eco Options program, which helps customers identify products validated as having reduced impact on the environment."
,,,,"It’s also what’s behind our Chemical Strategy, which guides our efforts to work with suppliers to reduce the indoor air quality impact of chemicals used in the products we sell."
,,,,"Reducing, Reusing and Recycling An alternative economic model, circular economy, got a lot of buzz at Greenbuild."
,,,,The approach aims to limit — and ultimately eliminate — waste generated from products and packaging.

,,,,"It’s supported by Project Sync, our multiyear, omnichannel initiative that identifies better ways to move our products."
,,,,Our progress is driven by entrepreneurial ideas and innovation.
,,,,"For example, we’re employing predictive analytics to better forecast the future using data from sales, consumer trends, weather patterns, supply chain disruptors (like COVID-19) and more."
,,,,"We’re shifting management of some product distribution from our suppliers to our own supply chain associates, gaining greater end-to-end visibility, control over transportation modes and efficiencies that reduce miles and emissions.By making our supply chain more efficient, we reduce business costs and the impact that our product distribution has on the environment."
,,,,"Discover some of the ways we improved our supply chain in 2019:More than 300 hydrogen fuel cells provided emissions-free fuel for forklifts at our facilities in Troy Township, Ohio, and Savannah, Georgia, reducing energy use by nearly 4 million kilowatt hours every year.Predictive analytics enabled us to shave 13% off the time it takes to move goods from distribution centers to stores, decreasing emissions from trucks.DID YOU KNOW We participate in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay® program to collect and report greenhouse gas emissions data from corporate supply chains."
,,,,The Home Depot is a six-time recipient of the SmartWay Excellence Award.
,,,,"Plug-In Rigs Electric 18-wheelers are rolling into our supply chain on the West Coast, where one of our core transportation providers is piloting Freightliner eCascadias."
,,,,The e-trucks have a 250-mile range and can be recharged to 80% capacity in 90 minutes.
,,,,"73 2020 Responsibility Report The Home Depot Applying advanced analytics to inventory calculations decreased product storage time by 1.2 days, even as customer demand grew."
,,,,That reduced our facilities’ energy consumption and emissions.
,,,,"By optimizing how we loaded products into trailers, we maximized loads — avoiding emissions from about 10,500 trucks traveling 15 million miles.We sold available space on our trucks and bought space from other companies, ensuring fewer underloaded trailers hit the road."
,,,,That space sharing saved about 1.8 million driven miles.
,,,,Optimizing Every Load Products on pallets are easier to load and unload but don’t use all available trailer space.
,,,,"By partnering with suppliers to forgo pallets, we can stack products to the top of the trailer, resulting in as much as a 40% reduction in truck space needed to transport some goods."
,,,,"At our inbound freight consolidation facilities, we’re using technology tools to optimize product storage and flow, reducing inventory, increasing our speed to market and ensuring more trucks depart fully loaded."
,,,,"Maximizing Every Mile Our technical fleet optimization team does a week-ahead, technology- assisted assessment of scheduled pickups and deliveries, then prescribes each driver’s path to reduce miles traveled, fuel consumed and trucks on the road."
,,,,"To ensure our fuller trucks are burning fuel efficiently, we use an artificial intelligence tool to set the engine utilization grind for optimal truck performance based on load weight."
,,,,We developed a way to use our order tracking technology to identify “orphan” products.
,,,,Those goods hitch a ride on a truck already going to the right destination.

,,,,"We launched Eco Options in 2007 in partnership with SCS Global Services, a leading, independent, third-party certification body that validates environmental claims."
,,,,"For a product to receive Eco Options classification, the supplier must document attributes that prove it has less of an impact on the environment than comparable products in the same category."
,,,,"Until all industries create and abide by a reporting formula that measures product attributes according to a common sustainability standard, we will continue to use our Eco Options program to help customers sort through green product claims."
,,,,Products that qualify for our Eco Options program meet stringent criteria based on their impact in one or more of six key areas.Save money and power REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT GREENER PRODUCTS Our products strategy reflects the understanding that our greatest environmental impact comes from the products we sell.
