Walsh: Our success is driven by our people and their commitment to get results the right way.,,,
"Chevron’s Human Rights Policy details the expectations we have of our employees, suppliers and business partners to deliver on this commitment.",,,
This means conducting our business in a socially and environmentally responsible manner and respecting the law and universal human rights to benefit the communities where we work.,,,
Mahendra: Why does Chevron have a human rights policy?,,,
Mahendra: Chevron recently updated our Human Rights Policy.,,,
Why?,,,
"Walsh: Chevron first implemented our Human Rights Policy in 2009, with only minor updates in the years since.",,,
"However, in 2019 we undertook a complete review of the policy and associated guidelines, processes and procedures to ensure that they reflect more clearly the company’s commitment to respecting human rights.",,,
chevron.com/sustainability 22 chevron.com/sustainability 22 Mahendra: Can you describe the changes that were made?,,,
Walsh: There were three main changes.,,,
"First, we clearly state our continuing commit­ment to international human rights norms: “We commit to respect human rights as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work as well as adhere to the principles set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights , the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights , and the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standards .” Second, we clarified that we expect our suppliers and contractors to respect human rights and adhere to applicable international principles.",,,
"We also encourage our business partners—those businesses with which Chevron is associated in a joint venture, partnership or other form of business collaboration—to do the same.",,,
"This means going beyond Chevron’s direct operational control, seeking to use our influence to promote respect for human rights by our suppliers and contractors.",,,
"Third, Chevron has developed a Human Rights Defenders Statement that explicitly states that we will not tolerate physical threats, intimidation or violence against human rights defenders who are lawfully exercising legitimate rights.",,,
"We also expect and encourage our suppliers, contractors and business partners to comply with this statement.",,,
“Our success is driven by our people and their commitment to get results the right way.,,,
"” — Dale Walsh Vice President, Corporate Affairs Walsh: Can you speak about the integration of human rights across our work at Chevron?",,,
"Mahendra: Respect for human rights is embedded in Chevron’s existing processes, most notably the Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS).",,,
Both the stakeholders and security focus areas within OEMS are key to how we integrate human rights into our work.,,,
"For example, Chevron has a Security Risk Assessment Program (SRAP) through which security risks are identified and assessed, from corporate level down to individual facilities and from conceptual projects to mature operations.",,,
One of the focus areas involves identifying human rights concerns.,,,
"The process is designed to help ensure any safeguards put into place adhere to the main international framework on security and human rights, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.",,,
This is one of the many ways we systematically identify relevant human rights-related risks in various parts of our operations and establish safeguards that help us comply with our Human Rights Policy.,,,
What are some other examples of how Chevron works to protect human rights?,,,
Walsh: One example is how a group of employees in Houston took action to fight human trafficking.,,,
"Working with our ESG and Sustainability team, the employees were able to connect their local volunteering with broader corporate efforts on modern slavery and human trafficking, a key issue in the business and human rights space.",,,
Chevron is now collaborating with peers in the oil and gas industry to raise awareness of human trafficking.,,,
"We’re also sponsoring Truckers Against Trafficking, a nonprofit organization dedicated to fighting modern slavery by working with transport and logistics providers.",,,
"Additionally, there are initiatives across the enterprise that help create a safe and equal environment free of discrimination for employees.",,,
This promotes the realization of human rights every day.,,,
"chevron.com/sustainability 23 chevron human rights policy 520 employees We treat all employees with respect and dignity, and promote diversity in the workplace.",,,

"In Australia, we launched our inaugural Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) to drive our contribution to reconciliation, both within the organization and the community.",,,
"It lays out our vision, aspirations and hopes for our relationships with Aboriginal people based on a culture of diversity, inclusion, trust and respect.",,,
Our RAP sets the tone for the engagements and relationships we want to have with Aboriginal people.,,,
"Most importantly, our RAP was developed together with Aboriginal people from across our business and communities where we operate.",,,

"For Wanda’s biography, please visit chevron.com/about/leadership/wanda-austin .",,,
Francis: What is the role of the Public Policy Committee (PPC) that you chair?,,,
Austin: I have been PPC Chair since May 2018.,,,
"The role of the PPC is to provide oversight in the areas of environmental, social, human rights, political and public policy matters as they affect Chevron’s business and the company’s ability to deliver on its purpose.",,,
"We engage the management team in detailed discussions and reviews on subjects such as proxy proposals, corporate policies, lobbying, community engagement and showing up as the responsible corporate citizen that we are.",,,
"Austin: One of the many reasons it’s exciting to serve on the Chevron Board is that, much like the aerospace industry, the energy sector is a demanding and high-consequence business.",,,
Chevron has a very clear focus on the mission and everyone on the team understands the importance of what they are doing.,,,
"It improves the quality of life for everybody when we, the Chevron “we,” do a good job.",,,
"So my experience in aerospace, my experience advising the President of the United States in science and technology and my experience on other boards all comes together at Chevron.",,,
Francis: How has your prior experience leading The Aerospace Corporation informed your perspective as a Director on the Chevron Board?,,,
chevron.com/sustainability 26 chevron.com/sustainability 26 Francis: How does the Board oversee ESG issues at Chevron?,,,
"Austin: As a board, we assess management’s policies, practices and performance.",,,
We rigorously review plans and proposals for the metrics set to measure ESG progress.,,,
We want Chevron to clearly outline its position on policy matters with external stakeholders so they understand those positions.,,,
We also engage with shareholders and stakeholders to better understand and respond to their interests.,,,
Francis: What does good governance of ESG issues look like?,,,
Austin: Good governance is not just a label that we apply because it is currently a topical issue.,,,
"Good governance is a rigorous, structured and consistent approach to strategically look at issues for the long term.",,,
This is how we do business every day.,,,
"We continually focus on making sure we understand ESG impacts and how to continue to deliver our products in a manner consistent with transparent, sustainable and responsible performance.",,,
Francis: Have you experienced Chevron’s values when on the ground with employees?,,,
"Austin: Wherever I go in the world—and I’ve visited locations including Gorgon, El Segundo, the Permian and many others—there is a consistent focus on mission and a clear priority on safety and environmental protection among employees.",,,
This speaks to the culture.,,,
"Everyone understands what they do is difficult, and they live Chevron’s core value to protect people and the environment.",,,

We must be unsatisfied with the status quo.,,,
"We must continually search for ‘what’s next,’ ‘what else’ and ‘what if.’” — Dr. Wanda M. Austin Public Policy Committee Chair Francis: How is Chevron reporting on climate change risks and opportunities?",,,
"Austin: The company was one of the first to publish a TCFD-aligned report addressing governance, risk management, strategy and metrics.",,,
"We communicate internally and externally about specific actions we are taking to reduce methane emissions, flaring and carbon intensity and achieve carbon sequestration.",,,
"We set challenging targets and goals, measure our progress against them and incorporate those metrics into our compensation plan for employees so that they understand we need their innovation.",,,
Francis: Chevron has issued three climate reports in the last three years.,,,
What involve­ment does the Board and the PPC have in issuing those voluntary publications?,,,
Austin: Our involvement begins before the reports are produced.,,,
We discuss the need for transparency and responsiveness.,,,
The manage­ment team knows we are supportive of its proactive approach and is aware that we are going to challenge them to think “what’s next” in their communications.,,,
The PPC reviews the reports and provides appropriate suggestions.,,,
"These publications are critical tools that spark dialogue, help educate our key audiences, and explain the role companies play in address­ing the dual challenge of enabling economic development and addressing climate resiliency.",,,
Francis: How is Chevron preparing for the energy transition?,,,
Austin: Chevron has always been in the energy transition business.,,,
"Going forward, the opportunity is for us to improve our business as we know and understand it today but also to envision what it could be in the future through new technology and new tools.",,,
We must lead.,,,
We know our business inside out.,,,
"If there is an opportunity to do something good for the future of the planet, I believe Chevron will figure out what that is.",,,

"The Board has four standing committees: Audit, Board Nominating and Governance, Management Compensation, and Public Policy.",,,
Each committee helps Chevron manage risks across the company and compete more effectively to build long-term shareholder value.,,,
"For example, the Public Policy Committee (PPC) helps the Board manage risks related to the social, political, environmental, human rights and public policy aspects of Chevron’s business.",,,
The PPC reports its discussions to the full Board for consideration and action when appropriate.,,,
All committees include only independent Directors.,,,

Payne: Innovation is not what creates an enduring safety culture.,,,
An enduring safety culture creates innovation.,,,
Our culture demands that we work to eliminate serious injuries and fatalities and that we work to improve in safety performance every year.,,,
We cannot do that by simply getting better at doing the same thing.,,,
"We must innovate, and we are constantly working to achieve that aspiration.",,,

Jones: How do we keep people motivated to work safely every day?,,,
"Payne: We motivate people by making safety personal, both for frontline workers and supervisors.",,,
"We talk to workers about what is important to them—their family, co-workers, hobbies—and then discuss the potential impact of getting hurt or worse.",,,
We ask challenging questions like: What would happen to your family if you didn’t come home?,,,
These conversations shift the focus from compliance to something much more personal.,,,
"For supervisors, we expect them to demonstrate authentic care and concern for their workforce.",,,
We want them to focus on safety because they truly care about people.,,,

"Payne: One example of a lesson learned we applied across the business is the Learning Team tool, which was initially adopted in our refineries.",,,
"This tool emphasizes giving workers a voice in their operations, and it has spread rapidly across the entire enterprise.",,,
A second example is our Verification and Validation (V&V) Coaching Program.,,,

take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts chevron.com/sustainability 37 environmental performance table continues on page 39 *The data included in our 2019 performance data table are informed by internationally recognized reporting standards and frameworks.,,,
"While Chevron relies primarily on the reporting guidelines, indicators and terminology in the Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting (2015) by the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA), the International Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) Association and the American Petroleum Institute (API) to determine what data to include in the table, the content for this table and the larger report was identified through prior issue prioritization processes and current year external engagements with stakeholders.",,,
Our 2019 performance data table includes an index column that maps Chevron’s data to the corresponding relevant 2015 IPIECA standards.,,,
** We used the general SASB topics to organize Chevron’s table and provide an index column to identify common reporting elements between our current reporting data and the related SASB standards.,,,
The SASB index is based solely on Chevron’s interpretation and judgment.,,,
"The inclusion of the SASB index does not indicate the application of definitions, metrics, measurements, standards or approaches set forth in the SASB framework.",,,
Please refer to the notes for information about Chevron’s data reporting basis.,,,
"As reflected in the table, Chevron currently discloses data on a number of issues recom­ mended in the SASB Oil and Gas Exploration and Production; Midstream; and Refining and Marketing standards.",,,
"Further, there are many topics on which Chevron discloses data beyond the SASB framework.",,,
SASB recommendations not addressed in the data table are being studied by Chevron for potential future inclusion.,,,
Chevron could determine that some SASB recommendations do not reflect useful sustainability performance information or would be overly burdensome to implement on a global basis; such disclosures will not be included in a future data table.,,,
"We strive to continually improve our data performance reporting, and we believe that our SASB index is a positive step in further aligning our ESG reporting to SASB framework recommendations.",,,
We also continue to assess alignment with other emerging frameworks.,,,

2 The World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Develop­ment Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard defines three “scopes” that Chevron uses to report GHG emissions.,,,
"Scope 1 includes direct emissions from sources within a facility, and for 2019 has been updated to remove previously included third­party vessels per industry guid ­ ance.",,,
Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from electricity and steam that Chevron facilities import.,,,
Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions.,,,
Chevron reports information related to Scope 3 emissions from third­party use of our products.,,,
"All six Kyoto GHGs—carbon dioxide ( CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons—are included in Chevron’s Scope 1 emissions.",,,
"CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O are accounted for in Chevron’s Scope 2 emissions and in Chevron’s Scope 3 emissions related to the electricity and steam that Chevron exports to third parties.",,,
"The following entities are not currently included in the 2019 Chevron corporate GHG inventory: Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, and other nonoperated assets in which Chevron has an equity interest of 16 percent or less.",,,
Information regarding GHG emissions from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC can be found at cpchem.com .,,,
"Calculation methods are based on API’s Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (2009) or where relevant, local regulatory reporting methodologies.",,,
3 Direct GHG emissions related to production of energy in the form of electricity or steam exported or sold to a third party have been included in the reported Scope 1 emissions to conform to the 2015 IPIECA reporting guidance.,,,
2019 direct GHG emissions decreased in part as a result of divestment of Cape Town Refinery and assets in IndoAsia business unit.,,,
Emissions from the nonoper ­ ated assets in Canada business unit have been revised for 2019 to reflect more site­specific data.,,,
4 Restated indirect emissions and emissions from exported electricity and steam from 2015 to 2018.,,,
Scope 2 emissions are accounted for using the market­ based approach as described in the World Resources Institute’s GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance .,,,

"The emissions included in the metrics generally represent the equity­share of emissions, which are emissions from operated and nonoperated joint­venture (NOJV) assets.",,,
"The scope may include sources outside of traditional scoping of equity emissions, including captive emissions from processes like drilling and completions and tolling agree ­ ments up to the point of third­party custody transfer of the oil or gas product.",,,
"For oil and gas production intensity metrics, allocation of emissions between oil and gas are based on the fraction of production represented by liquids or gas.",,,
Production is aligned with values reported as net production in the Chevron Corporation Supplement to the Annual Report .,,,
Flaring and methane intensities use the total of liquids and gas production.,,,
"Oil and gas production intensities use liquids production and natural gas produc ­ tion, respectively.",,,
"7 For 2019, Chevron is reporting only on direct emissions, not intensity.",,,
8 Total energy consumption decreased due primarily to divestiture of Cape Town Refinery and removal of third­party vessels.,,,
"Refining energy performance is measured by the Manufacturing Energy Index (MEI), which is calculated using the Solomon Energy Intensity Index methodology.",,,
MEI includes operated assets and nonoperated joint­venture refineries.,,,
"Energy performance for Oronite, Lubricants, Americas Products and International Products is measured by the Non­Manufacturing Energy Index, which is the energy required to produce Chevron products compared to the energy that would have been required to produce the same products in 1992 (the index’s base year).",,,
"9 For compiling and reporting air emissions data, Chevron follows regulatory defini ­ tions of VOC.",,,
"SO x emissions include SO 2 and SO 3, reported as SO 2­equivalent.",,,
NO x emissions include NO and NO 2 (reported as NO 2­equivalent) and exclude N 2O.,,,
"VOC, SO x and NO x emissions decreased in 2019 in part due to asset divestments, transfers of operatorship, ends of contract, and refinements made in data calcula ­ tion methods.",,,
10 Fresh water withdrawn from the environment is defined per local legal definitions.,,,
"If no local definition exists, fresh water is defined as water extracted, directly or indirectly, from surface water, groundwater or rainwater that has a total dissolved solids concentration of less than or equal to 2,000 mg/L.",,,
"Fresh water withdrawn does not include effluent or recycled/reclaimed water from municipal or other industrial wastewater treatment systems, as this water is reported under nonfresh water withdrawn.",,,
Nonfresh water withdrawn could include: seawater; brackish groundwater or surface water; reclaimed wastewater from another municipal or industrial facility; desalinated water; or remediated groundwater used for industrial purposes.,,,
"Produced water is excluded from fresh water withdrawn, fresh water consumed and nonfresh water withdrawn.",,,
"Nonfresh water withdrawn totals increased in 2019 in part due to an increase in well completions in the Mid­Continent business unit, which use brackish water, as well as an increase in municipal reclaimed water use in Richmond Refinery.",,,
"11 Oil concentration is determined by the sampling of effluent streams, using methods required or recommended by regulatory agencies or authorities, where applicable.",,,
"Chevron reports the total cumulative amount of oil discharged to surface water excluding spills, which are reported separately.",,,
12 Chevron reports petroleum spills to land and water to conform to the 2015 IPIECA reporting guidance.,,,
Spills to land and water that are greater than or equal to one barrel are included.,,,
"Spills to secondary containment, chemical spills and spills due to sabotage are excluded.",,,
13 The seven (7) spills of significance that Chevron experienced in 2019 ranged in size from 0.02 to 0.4 thousand barrels.,,,
"Of the one (1.14) thousand barrels spilled in total, 0.6 were spilled to secondary containment.",,,
"For purposes of conforming to the 2015 IPIECA reporting guidance, Chevron defines a spill of significance as a process safety Tier 1 loss­of­primary­containment (LOPC) event (as defined by American National Standards Institute/American Petroleum Institute [ANSI/API] Recommended Practice [RP] 754) with a conse ­ quence of a release of material greater than the threshold quantities described in Table 1 of ANSI/API RP 754 in any one­hour period.",,,
"Spills to secondary containment, regardless of actual environmental impact, are included, as are chemical spills.",,,
Releases to air are excluded.,,,
"14 To conform to the 2015 IPIECA reporting guidance, and where appropriate infor ­ mation and data exist, our hazardous waste numbers starting in 2015 exclude remediation waste generated, disposed of and recycled.",,,
"Hazardous waste amounts are quantified using methods required or recommended by regulatory agencies or authorities, where applicable.",,,
"In other instances, similar methods are used, including direct measurement onsite or at the point of shipping, engineering estimates, and process knowledge.",,,
"Chevron follows the regulatory definitions of hazardous waste applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate, including de minimis specifications (below which hazardous waste quantities do not need to be reported).",,,
15 The 2018 data have been restated.,,,
The 2019 data are based on information received from government entities and recorded internally prior to the publication of this report.,,,

,,,"reducing our carbon intensity While conversation about the energy transition often focuses on future actions, we are making progress today."
,,,"We have identified nearly 100 GHG abatement projects to reduce the carbon intensity of our opera - t ions, and expect them to deliver approxi m ately 4 million tonnes of emissions reductions per year when completed."
,,,"In 2021, we started 36 decarbonization projects and completed five."
,,,"In 2022, we are more than doubling the number of projects to 75 and expect to spend approximately $2 billion total on similar projects through 2028. leading in methane management We continue to lead in methane management in our U.S. operations, particularly in the Permian, where our methane intensity is 85% lower than the basin average."
,,,"Chevron is on track to meet our 2028 target to reduce enterprise methane emissions intensity by more than 50% from 2016 levels and eliminate routine flaring by 2030.To continue making progress, we’re expanding methane detection capabilities."
,,,"In addition to tradi t ional ground-based sensors, we’re deploying detection technology using satellites, air c raft and drones for broader coverage."
,,,"Better methane detection is critical to reducing carbon intensity, and our work with industry and academic partners contributes to improving the accuracy and credibility of global methane reporting."
,,,"new opportunities, new partnerships Reducing carbon emissions today requires partner - s hip and collaboration, because no one company, industry or nation – acting alone – can meet the world’s energy and climate goals."
,,,"This is particularly true with harder-to-abate sectors, such as manufacturing, agriculture, aviation and heavy-duty transportation."
,,,"We are working with innovators around the globe to develop breakthrough technologies and building new partnerships to scale lower carbon solutions.In this spirit, we formed Chevron New Energies, leveraging our unique capabilities, assets and customers."

,,,"Mrs. Teran is a proud member of Somos (Spanish for “We are”), one of Chevron’s 12 employee networks that promote diversity and inclusion."
,,,"Somos provides leadership development, promotes inclusive behaviors, and helps create meaningful connections with Latin American and Hispanic employees at Chevron."
,,,Their discussion covered a wide range of topics – from expectations regarding the pace of the energy transition to the role diversity can play in managing organizational change.
,,,Ms. Reed-Klages shared her thoughts on Chevron’s role in a lower carbon future and the thoughtful approach we have taken thus far to advance an orderly transition.
,,,"Debra Reed-Klages, Audit Committee Chair Vanessa Teran, Employee Network Specialist chevron.com/sustainability 8Teran: Can you reflect on how Chevron is managing the energy transition?"
,,,Reed-Klages: Chevron’s approach to the energy transition balances ambition and reality.
,,,It recognizes that the energy transition is exactly that – a transition.
,,,"The world needs energy, and advancing to a lower carbon future should not leave anyone behind."
,,,We are driving down the carbon intensity of our oil and natural gas production today and investing to develop lower carbon energy solutions for tomorrow.
,,,A diversity of approaches toward achieving a lower carbon future is essential.
,,,"Chevron is targeting the sectors of the econo my that are difficult to decarbonize – manufac tur- ing, aviation and heavy-duty transportation – because they are much more difficult to electrify than light-duty transportation."
,,,"Chevron has the capabilities, assets and customers to drive change and innovation in these critical sectors, but such innovation will require ambitious government policies designed to align goals, create viable markets and serve as a catalyst for action."
,,,Teran: Can you share how the Board approached the launch of Chevron New Energies (CNE)?
,,,Reed-Klages: I am really excited about CNE.
,,,Our port folio of energy technologies is expected to evolve over time as we advance toward a lower carbon future.
,,,"Chevron recognized that to be a future leader, we needed to create an organization with a singular focus on pursuing lower carbon businesses."
,,,CNE builds on Chevron’s competitive advantages and provides a platform to accelerate lower carbon business activities in harder-to-abate sectors.
,,,"For example, Chevron’s experience in operating complex refineries supports our hydrogen efforts; our experience in drilling helps us be leaders in carbon capture, utilization and storage; and our customer base in harder-to-abate sectors benefits from our ability to develop lower carbon products and solutions."
,,,"In addition, Chevron is a goal- oriented organization, and CNE’s launch has helped focus the business on achieving the hydrogen and carbon capture targets we have set for ourselves.Teran: What have you learned about Chevron’s culture since you joined the Board?"
,,,Reed-Klages: I’ve been particularly struck by the pride employees take in their jobs and the variety and length of their careers at Chevron.
,,,"As employees move through different roles, they learn the implications of decisions on other parts of the business and build a robust picture of what drives value."
,,,Employees care about colleagues and business performance because they want to be a part of Chevron’s future.
,,,I’ve also been struck by the themes of caring and doing the right thing that permeate Chevron’s culture.
,,,"For example, Chevron discloses GHG emissions data and established carbon intensity reduction targets on an equity basis – covering GHG emissions from company-operated and nonoperated joint ven tures."
,,,"Despite having less control over nonoperated joint ventures, transparently communicating our progress toward achieving global GHG emissions reduction goals is the right thing to do."
,,,Teran: How does the Board embrace diversity and why does diversity matter?
,,,"Reed-Klages: In November 2021, Chevron was recognized by the Women’s Forum of New York for having more than 40% of our Board seats held by women."
,,,"Overall, the Board seeks to achieve diversity of age, gender and ethnicity and recognizes it’s important to refresh Board membership and committee chair positions to introduce fresh ideas and perspectives."
,,,This multidimensional diversity enables the Board to challenge itself and management from different points of view.
,,,"Chevron believes innovative solutions to our most complex challenges emerge when diverse people, ideas and experiences come together in an inclusive environment."
,,,"I believe diversity brings not only new ideas and perspectives, but also resilience through change."
,,,Inclusion cultivates authenticity and a sense of belonging that can foster meaningful connections among employees.
,,,These connections can give people the strength they will need as our business evolves and we advance a lower carbon future.

,,,"Thoughtful engagement around priority issues (sometimes called “material issues” in the context of ESG reporting frameworks 1) helps us assess and, where necessary, refresh our ESG strategy and commitments and validate priorities in relation to business risk and opportunities."
,,,The content for our Corporate Sustainability Report (2021) was identified through issue prioritization processes and engagements with internal and external stakeholders through out the year.
,,,"To gain insight into ESG issues and reporting trends, we engage with numerous third-party groups, including: World Business Council for Sustainable Develop ment, World Economic Forum, Business for Social Responsibility and Ipieca."
,,,"In addition, we benchmark and obtain third-party reviews of our prior year’s Sustainability Report and send questionnaires to more than 100 internal subject matter experts and stakeholders to test our thinking."
,,,"In 2021, we had more than 100 engagements with investors and other stake holders in which a wide range of issues was discussed, such as climate change, corporate culture, cybersecurity, water, human capital management and employee mental health following COVID-19."
,,,"As part of our reporting cycle, we provide relevant members of the Executive Leadership Team and senior management, the Global Issues Committee, and the Board’s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee with the opportunity to review and provide input to the planned content for our voluntary Sustainability Report ."
,,,"Since 2020, we have partnered with Datamaran, an ESG risk identification and monitoring software company that uses a comprehensive data-driven process to identify, prioritize and monitor ESG issues."
,,,"Its business intelligence tool aims to leverage artificial intelligence to incorporate a wide array of inputs, including corporate reports, global regulations, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) metrics, social media and online news."
,,,We believe this tool is one of many useful inputs into our overall process for assessing the relevance of ESG issues and trends and that it helps us evaluate our alignment with diverse and sometimes competing stakeholder interests.
,,,Commitment to transparency We demonstrate our commitment to transparency by report - ing metrics and performance data annually.
,,,"To deter mine which metrics to include, we consider the reporting guidance, indicators and terminology of the SASB, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry (2020) by Ipieca, the International Association for Oil & Gas Producers and the American Petroleum Institute, as well as other leading reporting frameworks."
,,,"We have also disclosed our ESG data, including GHG emissions data, in the IHS Markit ESG Reporting Repository to enable investors and other stakeholders to efficiently compare ESG data across sectors and reporting frameworks in the absence of consistent mandatory reporting requirements."
,,,Responding to our stakeholders Our stakeholder engagement process has resulted in action in our business and enhancements to our reporting.
,,,"These are but a few examples: • In 2021, in response to a proxy proposal and investor feed - back, we created an updated lobbying and trade association webpage that includes additional transparency on both lobbying and political contributions."
,,,• Discussions with investors have shaped our reporting and led us to utilize SASB and TCFD frameworks for sustainability disclosures.
,,,"Beginning in 2019, we enhanced our reporting by aligning our performance data table with the recommen dations of the SASB voluntary framework, as reflected in our SASB index column."
,,,"In 2020, we began considering how our data related to the core Stakeholder Capitalism metrics devel oped by the World Economic Forum."
,,,These enhance ments help provide comparable information for investors and other stakeholders.

,,,"Accomplishing this aspiration depends on continuing progress on commercially viable technology; govern ment policy; successful negotiations for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and nature-based projects; the availability of cost-effective, verifiable offsets in the global market; and the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities."
,,,"An economically efficient approach to GHG abatement An economically efficient approach to GHG abatement is to prioritize efforts that curtail emissions at the lowest cost per tonne, irrespective of the sectors in which those abate ments occur."
,,,Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs) provide Chevron with a methodology to identify and prioritize a port - folio of the most promising GHG abatement opportunities across operations.
,,,This MACC approach has provided other companies and gov ern ments with investment insights that focus on achieving the greatest volume of GHG reductions at the least cost to society.
,,,Reduce carbon intensity of our own operations Our target for Upstream oil and natural gas intensity is 24 kg CO 2e/boe.
,,,"To reduce the carbon intensity of our own operations, we have identified nearly 100 projects and plan to spend more than $300 million in 2022."
,,,"In 2021, we made progress on 36 pro jects and completed five."
,,,We expect to spend approxi mately $2 billion total on similar projects through 2028.
,,,"When completed, the projects are expected to deliver approximately 4 million tonnes of emissions reductions per year."
,,,"In the years beyond 2028 in our MACC port folio planning, we have identified opportunities that have the potential to further lower our Upstream carbon intensity to the mid-teens, helping us get closer to our net zero Upstream aspiration."
,,,Significant technology advancements and the development of large offsets markets could enable reductions to net zero by mid-century.
,,,"using carbon price as the primary policy tool In 2020, more than 60% of our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 equity GHG emissions were in regions with existing or devel - op ing carbon-pricing policies."
,,,Equity emissions include emissions from operated and nonoperated joint-venture assets based on Chevron’s financial interest.
,,,"To reduce emissions, we believe a price on carbon is the most efficient mechanism for public policy because it harnesses market forces."
,,,"For example, our Eastern Mediterranean business unit supported Israel’s adoption of a price on carbon as the primary policy tool for fulfilling the state’s carbon reduction goals."
,,,"By adopting a market-based approach to carbon reduction, Israel has shown it’s at the forefront of countries around the world in addressing global climate change."

,,,Early-stage federal investment can help the United States become a leader in developing emerging technologies that the world’s leading energy and climate experts deem critical to addressing climate change.
,,,engaging globally Climate change requires global engagement and action.
,,,We believe market-based mechanisms applied across the broadest possible coverage of emissions are the most effective and efficient way to reduce emissions.
,,,"As a member of the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), Chevron has supported IETA’s mission to be the trusted business voice on market-based climate solutions."
,,,"Through IETA and other business groups, Chevron remains engaged as official observers to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which seeks to build global consensus on cooperative approaches between governments, NGOs, research organizations and other stakeholders to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement."
,,,"In addition, well-designed policy should enable linking with other markets to build a globally coordinated system."
,,,Linking to other jurisdictions directly or through flexible market mecha - nisms such as offsets can create opportunities for global coordination while avoiding unintended trade and investment impacts and the risk of offshoring jobs and emissions.
,,,"climate change policy framework elements of well-designed policy:we believe policymakers should: • Include all sectors of the economy • Complement and reinforce rather than hinder market efficiency • Utilize a price on carbon as the primary policy tool• Enable linking with other markets • Recognize and account for negative emissions technologies and offsets • Support early-stage pre-commercial activity and research and development for breakthrough technologiesour overarching vision:we support policy that enables the realization of a lower carbon future at least cost to society promote transparency and equitytake a balanced and measured approachencourage investment in technology, research and innovationensure global engagement and action+ + + chevron.com/sustainability 16The PCI metric, which includes Scope 1, 2 and 3, represents the carbon intensity across the full value chain associated with bringing products to market.chevron’s portfolio carbon intensity (PCI)transport transport+ + + processing productionthird-party operations transport transport+ + + processing productionchevron operations CCUS and offsetsuse of products supporting transparency Consistent and comparable climate reporting We aim to lead the industry in transparent climate change- related reporting and support efforts to enhance the comparability and consistency of such information in public disclosures."

,,,"LRQA’s assurance engagement covered Chevron’s operations and activities worldwide and evaluated how effective Chevron’s reporting processes were in delivering health, safety and environmental indicators that are useful for assessing corporate performance and reporting information consistent with core and additional reporting elements in the Ipieca/API/IOGP Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry (2020) and SASB Oil and Gas – Exploration and Production, Midstream, and Refining & Marketing accounting metrics referenced in the performance data tables."
,,,"In some cases, Ipieca elements and SASB metrics referenced are partially reported."
,,,"For more than 10 years, we have conducted independent third-party assurance of Chevron’s GHG emissions."
,,,"In 2021, we expanded this assurance to include Chevron’s performance data, Scope 3 emissions and GHG emissions on an operational- control basis."
,,,"The objective is to assess whether the assured emissions data are reported in accordance with the principles of completeness, comparability across the organization and accuracy, including calculations, use of appropriate conversion factors and consolidation."

,,,"PCI definition: Estimated energy-weighted average GHG emissions intensity from a simplified value chain from the production, refinement, distribution and end use of marketed energy products per unit of energy delivered."
,,,"Units: Grams of carbon dioxide-equivalent GHG emissions per megajoule of energy delivered (g CO 2e/MJ) on a higher- heating-value basis to align with prior frameworks on gas value chain emissions and with heating values commonly used in commercial contracts.† Scope: The PCI is calculated on an annual basis as the weighted- average GHG intensity of energy delivered across gas, natural gas liquid (NGL), oil, biofuel, hydrogen and lower carbon power products."
,,,"Carbon removals are deducted from total lifecycle emissions estimates.The following energy products ( i) are included in the PCI methodology: • Gas: piped gas, LNG and third-party-traded volumes • Natural gas liquids: NGLs from Upstream, refining and third- party-traded volumes • Oil: crude oil, refined products (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, fuel oil and other petroleum products) and third-party- traded volumes • Biofuels: ethanol, renewable diesel, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel and renewable natural gas • Hydrogen: gray hydrogen, blue hydrogen and green hydrogen that are externally marketed • Lower carbon power: external sales of wind, solar and geothermal power The following removals ( j) are included in the PCI methodology calculation: • Carbon capture, utilization and storage removes CO 2 either directly from the atmosphere or from streams that would be released to the atmosphere."
,,,It does not include CO 2 produced from naturally occurring reservoirs that is used for enhanced oil recovery.
,,,• High-quality offsets include nature-based solutions.
,,,"For traditional hydrocarbon products (gas, NGL and oil), marketed volumes are based on the business segment (production, refined products or marketing) with the largest overall commodity volume, inclusive of all traded volumes."
,,,Chemicals and other business lines that do not primarily supply energy products are excluded from this calculation.
,,,† Several prior product-intensity frameworks have used lower heating value for intensity calculations.
,,,"chevron.com/sustainability 76Σ Σ Σmethodology and data sources Traditional hydrocarbon products: The intent of the frame - work is to capture value chain emissions associated with the maximum hydrocarbon product volume for a company among its production, refining and marketing activities."
,,,"For all products that a company produces or refines, the PCI methodology uses the company’s equity GHG emissions and corresponding GHG intensity."
,,,"To estimate the emissions for marketed products that the company does not produce or refine, the PCI methodology uses industry-average segment factors from the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook."
,,,Hydrocarbon transporta - tion emissions are estimated in the PCI using IEA World Energy Outlook estimates for transportation emissions from oil and gas.
,,,"Emissions associated with end use of marketed products are based on industry-standard combustion factors and assume all sold energy products are combusted, although this is not the case (e.g., plastics and lubricants)."
,,,The graphic on page 78 is a depiction of the value chain approach for the refined- product value chain.
,,,"Biofuels, hydrogen and lower carbon power: GHG emissions are calculated based on third-party lifecycle assessments and the energy provided by Chevron in the most recent year."
,,,"Lifecycle assessment data sources include California Air Resources Board (CARB) Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) Pathway Certified Carbon Intensities for similar feedstocks and pathways, a Hydrogen Council report on a lifecycle assessment for hydrogen decarbonization pathways, and harmonized lifecycle assessments of electricity generation from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group 1."
,,,The model does not adjust for the energy efficiency gains associated with some applications of electricity and hydrogen relative to existing hydrocarbon infrastructure.
,,,"For example, CARB estimates that energy provided as electricity to an electric vehicle is 3.4 times more efficient than energy provided by gasoline to an internal combustion engine."
,,,"Model updates could be made in the future, if supported by the end use of electricity or hydrogen products."
,,,"Inputs are collected from financial disclosures and public GHG reporting, with the exception of the biofuels component."
,,,"Biofuel volumes are based on purchase data for ethanol, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and biodiesel and production volumes for renewable natural gas in the United States, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Australia."
,,,Volumes from international GS Caltex operations in South Korea are assumed to be zero.
,,,"For 2016–2021, aggregate biofuel volumes used in the PCI calculation are 60,000, 61,000, 62,000, 68,000, 61,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day, respectively."
,,,Biofuel carbon intensity values are based on CARB LCFS default pathway values.
,,,"For 2016–2021, the weighted-average biofuel carbon intensity values used in the PCI calculation were 52, 52, 51, 50, 48 and 47 grams carbon dioxide-equivalent GHG emissions per megajoule, respectively."
,,,"CCUS: Net GHG removal emissions associated with CCUS represent the volume of emissions that would be permanently sequestered underground or utilized in other products with a deduction for supply chain emissions associated with capture, transport or storage."
,,,"CCUS projects that reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions would reduce the production, refining or other sectoral intensity and would not be double-counted as removals; for example, CO2 captured by an integrated CCS plant would already be accounted for in the facility’s Scope 1 emissions intensity."
,,,Offsets: Offsets that are retired by the company or on behalf of customers for use of product provided by the company are deducted from the total emissions in the metric.
,,,Improvements over time: Methodologies and emissions factors may be updated in future years to reflect additional information or data that become available.
,,,"For example, updates may include updated industry averages, primary data from third- party producers/refiners and adjustments to energy efficiency assumptions, if warranted, based on the end-use applications for volumes of energy marketed by the company.portfolio carbon intensity methodology note, cont.equations, cont."

,,,"For reporting, Chevron includes indirect sources of GHG emissions within Scope 1 that are outside of the traditional Scope 1 definition, such as GHG emissions from processes like drilling and completions, and tolling agreements up to the point of third-party custody transfer of the oil or gas product."
,,,"For oil and gas production intensity metrics, production is aligned with net production values reported in the Chevron Corporation Supplement to the Annual Report, which represent the company’s equity share of total production after deducting both royalties paid to landowners and a government’s agreed-upon share of production under a Production Sharing Agreement."
,,,Chevron’s equity-share emissions include emissions associated with these excluded royalty barrels in accordance with Ipieca guidance.
,,,"Also in accordance with Ipieca guidance, Chevron’s equity-share emissions do not include emissions associated with royalty payments received by the company."
,,,Allocation of emissions between oil and gas is based on the fraction of production represented by liquids or gas.
,,,Flaring and methane intensities use the total of liquids and gas production.
,,,"Oil and gas production intensities use liquids production and natural gas production, respectively."
,,,"refining carbon intensity , kilograms CO 2e/boe The refining carbon intensity (RCI) metric provides a measure of GHG released during the transformation of raw materials into refined products."

,,,"Enabled emissions reductions are the estimated avoided emissions relative to fossil fuel use primarily associated with biofuels, hydrogen, CCUS and offsets that the company has marketed in the most recent calendar year, regardless of whether the company retained rights to the emissions reduction attributes."
,,,"Over time, new energy products may be added to the calcu - lation, along with associated volume information."
,,,Avoided emissions associated with natural gas-fired power generation via co-generation or coal-fired power generation displacement are excluded from this calculation for purposes of simplicity.
,,,"For biofuels and hydrogen products, the enabled emissions reductions are calculated based on the lifecycle GHG savings relative to the same amount of energy provided by diesel fuel."
,,,"Where appropriate, energy efficiency factors are used to calculate the volumes of displaced fossil fuels."
