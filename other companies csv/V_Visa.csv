"Also, we need to continue to eliminate points of friction that still exist for consumers and business — from how value is exchanged between individuals, between businesses and how workers are paid in the growing gig economy.",,,
"Financial empowerment is an important component of lifting individuals and communities out of poverty, yet access is not always distributed equitably.",,,
"In response, we are focusing our business and philanthropic efforts on enabling the success of micro and small businesses (MSBs), particularly women-owned businesses.",,,

"1920Securing Commerce & Protecting Customers Connecting the world begins with our commitment to protect payments security, consumer privacy and transaction integrity.",,,
Visa employs an evolving and multi-layered approach to help protect the digital payments system and its users and to safeguard our network.,,,
"SDG 17 SDG 8 20Payments Security As of the end of 2018, the Visa network had enabled more than 3.3 billion card credentials that were available to be used at nearly 54 million merchant locations across the globe.",,,
"Even as payment volume has exponentially increased, we have evolved our security capabilities to lower the global fraud rate to less than 0.1 percent.",,,
"In 2018, we continued on our mission to significantly reduce fraud, increase approval rates and reduce consumer friction.",,,
"To succeed in this mission, we have implemented a security strategy that addresses the existing and emerging threats to data, transaction and infrastructure security, and that advances the security vision that we share with our ecosystem stakeholders.",,,
"The key components of the strategy are to:  Empower the consumer with stronger authentication, fraud detection and consumer tools  Invest in intelligence and technology to detect, prevent and eradicate threats and devalue data  Set a governance process to protect customers’ data  Promote a strategic vision, which is to be a catalyst for growth, enabling end-to-end risk solutions that increase approvals, reduce fraud and enhance the customer experience We continued on our mission to significantly reduce fraud, increase approval rates and reduce consumer friction.Empower the Consumer Visa’s security strategy starts with meeting the consumers’ needs for payment security, trust, reliability and convenience.",,,
"To meet these needs, we employ, authentication, fraud detection and consumer tools to address vulnerabilities in the payments ecosystem.",,,
Consumer Tools Consumers want to be in control.,,,
"Through our financial institution clients, we provide consumers with the ability to manage their security settings, enabling them to set restrictions on card use and to customize card alerts through Transaction Controls.",,,
The alerts can allow cardholders to identify unauthorized charges before fraud losses occur.,,,
A global Visa study found that cardholder alerts can reduce fraud by up to 37 percent.,,,
"Authentication Thinking beyond the 16-digit card number, we use data such as biometrics and payment device type to validate the authenticity of a transaction without negatively affecting the consumer experience.",,,
Fraud Detection Visa employs analytics to thwart potential fraud.,,,
Visa Advanced Authorization (VAA) uses machine learning to analyze payment fraud trends and to provide real-time risk scores for incoming transactions.,,,
"Visa Risk Manager enables our financial institution clients to create customized, analytics-informed rules that deliver the optimal customer experience based on the financial institutions’ risk appetite and strategy.",,,
These capabilities prevented an estimated $25 billion in fraud-related losses in 2018–2019.,,,
"* *The period specified here includes May 1, 2018–April 30, 2019.",,,
"2122Invest in Intelligence & Technology The second layer of our security strategy involves investing in intelligence and technology to prevent, detect and eradicate threats to payment data and infrastructure.",,,
"Securing payment data was fundamentally transformed with the introduction of the EMV® Chip, which allows for more secure transactions by producing a unique cryptogram for every single transaction, rather than using a static account number.",,,
Visa continues to build and invest in new technology to protect the payments ecosystem.,,,
Transactions/Payment Volume Increased AcceptanceFintech InitiativeMobile as acceptance deviceloT Time Fraud Rate Safeguard Clients Incent the Right Behavior Disrupt the Disruptors Next Gen Risk Tech/Tokenization Protect Visa TimeVisa works to devalue data by removing sensitive information from the ecosystem and making stolen data invalid via solutions like tokenization.,,,
" Tokenization — Tokens do not reveal account details, such as the 16-digit account number, so they have less value if stolen or intercepted during a transaction.",,,
"We predict that tokenization will be the “Chip for the Internet,” driving similar fraud reductions in digital commerce that chip cards have been able to achieve in the physical commerce space.",,,
Tokens can also be safely stored by online merchants or on mobile devices to facilitate e-commerce and mobile payments.,,,
"In 2018, we expanded Visa Token Service (VTS) to devalue data in 40 markets around the world.",,,
We are able to harness data by identifying potential fraud before it occurs via capabilities like Vital Signs and eCommerce Threat Disruption.,,,
 Vital Signs actively monitors for and helps prevent fraudulent ATM cash-out attempts for all VisaNet clients.,,,
ATM cash-outs occur when criminals simultaneously conduct withdrawals at multiple ATMs.,,,
"Our goal is to evolve Vital Signs to better detect broader patterns of suspicious behavior based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and to look for emerging methods of fraudulent attacks before significant losses result.",,,
 eCommerce Threat Disruption (eTD) works by proactively scanning websites for malicious payment malware.,,,
"In a recent case, eTD detected a compromise that affected multiple online service providers and potentially saved as much as $141 million before fraud could occur.",,,
"Set a Governance Process As industry leaders, we build and maintain trust via a set of standards, processes and rules that apply across the payments ecosystem.",,,
"We are continuously evaluating our partnership programs with our clients — issuers, merchants and acquirers — to ensure we are all working together to protect consumers’ data.",,,
"Promote a Strategic Vision The emergence of new technologies, new participants and new ways of transacting (for example, via new types of mobile devices) presents a unique set of security challenges that we must manage.",,,

"Collaboration We are strengthening and expanding our global capabilities through Visa’s Cyber Fusion Framework to rapidly collect, analyze and leverage cyber threat intelligence information flow internally from private and public sector partners.",,,
The bidirectional flow of information that results from Visa’s private and public sector partnerships is an important source of threat intelligence.,,,
It is vital to our efforts to stop cyberattacks targeting Visa and consumer payment information across the payments ecosystem.,,,
"In 2018, we opened a new Cyber Fusion Center in London, adding to our existing Center in the eastern U.S. We continuously work to protect our data and systems from various and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, phishing and social engineering schemes.",,,
"In 2018, we focused on building internal capabilities to reduce dependence on vendors and ensure faster development of security solutions.",,,
We are empowering and equipping developers across Visa to embrace a “Shift Left” mentality (resolving issues earlier in the software development lifecycle) to continually improve product security.,,,
"Through these efforts, we are creating “Security Champions” across the organization.",,,

"In calendar year 2018, we used approximately 711,268 gigajoules (GJ) of energy from electricity, natural gas and other fuels.",,,
"This represents a slight increase of 4.5 percent compared to 2017, which resulted from the continued expansion of our operations, with our employee headcount growing by 7.4 percent and our square footage increasing by 3.2 percent year-over-year.",,,
"Our energy intensity, a commonly used metric that adjusts for growth, improved by 9 percent year-over-year, representing four consecutive years of improvement.",,,
This energy use is reflected in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.,,,
"Since 2009, we have used international standards — such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development — to calculate and report the GHG emissions associated primarily with our energy usage.",,,
"In 2018, our direct (Scopes 1 and 2) GHG emissions, measured in absolute terms with a market-based approach, were 62,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e).",,,
"This represents a 5 percent decrease year-over-year from 2017 and a 34 percent decrease from our 2009 baseline year, largely driven by green building design, energy efficiency and the progress towards our commitment to purchase 100 percent renewable electricity.",,,
"Data Collection Rate 2014–2018 100% 75% 50% 25% 0% Electricity Natural Gas Water Waste 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Long-Term Climate Risks & Opportunities In response to increasing concern about the impact and risk associated with climate change, Visa completed our first formal climate risk assessment in alignment with the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures.",,,
We conducted a scenario-based climate assessment across many geographies to identify the risks and opportunities related to our operations and the broader transition to a low-carbon economy.,,,
"We expect the results of this analysis to continue to inform our key functions, including risk, strategy and government engagement.",,,
"Since 2009, our baseline year, our global office square footage has increased by 64 percent and our global employee population has grown by 159 percent.",,,
Our emissions intensity indicators have decreased as we have become more efficient and purchased renewable energy while growing our business.,,,
"Specifically:  Direct emissions per employee: decreased 12 percent vs 2017; decreased 75 percent vs 2009 baseline  Direct emissions per square foot of space: decreased 8 percent vs 2017; decreased 60 percent vs 2009 baseline  Direct emissions per dollar revenue: decreased 16 percent vs 2017; decreased 78 percent vs 2009 baseline In 2018, we expanded our Scope 3 emissions inventory and estimated emissions from the following relevant categories: business travel, waste and — for the first time in 2018 — purchased goods and services and employee commuting.",,,
We concluded that our Scope 3 emissions result primarily from procurement of goods and services and from business travel.,,,
"While our reported Scope 3 emissions increased year-over-year due to inclusion of additional categories, our emissions from commercial business travel decreased by 7 percent from 2017.",,,
"With our greatest energy usage and associated GHG emissions originating from purchased electricity at our offices and data centers, we continue to invest in energy efficiency efforts at those facilities.",,,
Our energy usage per transaction decreased by 16 percent compared to 2017.,,,
"In offices around the world, we are investing in energy efficiency measures, including LEED -based building design and operations, lighting upgrades and motion sensors.",,,
We also have an efficient electronics policy that mandates at least 90 percent of new electronics in our largest corporate campus offices meet either ENERGY STAR or EPACT certification standards.,,,
"As a result of these and other measures, at the end of 2018, 67 percent of Visa’s owned or leased square footage, occupied by 64 percent of our employees, had achieved LEED (or other green-building certification).",,,

,,,"33Our Results Since 2008 and with support from leading third-party environmental firms, Visa has conducted an annual global environmental footprint assessment to measure our global energy and water use, waste production, landfill diversion and GHG emissions."
,,,"Energy In 2020, we continued our commitment to improve our energy efficiency and procure renewable energy."
,,,"We used approximately 706,000 gigajoules (GJ) of energy from electricity, natural gas and other fuels."
,,,This represents a 5 percent decrease in consumption compared to 2019.
,,,"Our energy intensity per square foot, a commonly used metric that adjusts for growth, improved by 9 percent year-over-year, representing six consecutive years of improvement."
,,,We acknowledge that this year’s measured energy use was impacted in part by COVID-19 and the shift to a remote work environment for a majority of Visa’s employees.
,,,"100% Renewable Electricity As we began 2020, we announced the achievement of our goal to transition to using 100 percent renewable electricity."
,,,"We are proud of this accomplishment, yet also continue to pursue opportunities to contribute to additional renewable electricity generation through utility providers and external renewable energy suppliers and partners."
,,,"Visa continues to champion the overall corporate renewable energy movement, including through our support of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA).Greenhouse Gas Emissions Since 2009, we have used international standards, such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, to measure and report the GHG emissions associated primarily with our energy usage, business travel and employee commuting."
,,,"In 2019, we expanded our approach to measure and report on all Scope 3 emissions, including purchased goods and services."
,,,"In 2020, our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, measured in absolute terms with a market-based approach, were 13,900 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2 e)."
,,,This represents a 77 percent decrease year-over-year from 2019.
,,,The decrease in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions is largely due to the achievement of our goal to transition to 100 percent renewable electricity.
,,,"In 2020, we also: Responded once again to the CDP Climate Change questionnaire and received an A- score — a year- over-year improvement."
,,,Visa’s CDP response is available on the CDP website.
,,,Obtained independent verification of our energy and emissions data.
,,,"In carbon intensity, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions saw significant improvements in 2020 vs 2019: -Decreased 77 percent per employee -Decreased 78 percent per square foot of space -Decreased 76 percent per dollar revenue -Decreased 77 percent per transaction processed In 2020, we achieved carbon neutrality across our operations for the first time."
,,,"This achievement, which includes the footprint from our Scope 1, Scope 2 and employee commuting/business travel components of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, is the result of ongoing energy efficiency initiatives, our transition to 100% renewable electricity and limited use of carbon offsets to cover our residual footprint."
,,,"Our carbon offsets portfolio includes projects spanning our geographic regions, such as forest preservation in the U.S. and Canada, reforestation in Brazil, renewable energy in Turkey and clean cookstoves in India and Uganda."
,,,Water Visa recognizes and respects the importance of protecting water as a shared resource.
,,,"Though our business is not water intensive, we work to reduce the total water consumption at our offices and data centers by implementing data-driven efficiency efforts."
,,,"Globally in 2020, we used an estimated 57,100,000 gallons of potable water."
,,,"Of the total potable water use, 83 percent occurred in the United States and Canada, 9 percent in Europe and the remainder occurring elsewhere."
,,,"By facility type, 81 percent of potable water use occurred in our offices, while 19 percent occurred in our data centers, where we use a significant amount of reclaimed water."
,,,"Most of our potable water use occurs in offices, and we largely attribute our 14 percent potable water usage decrease year-over-year to office closures."
,,,"Waste Reduction & Diversion While not a major producer of solid waste, we continue to work to reduce the amount of office waste we dispose of in landfills."
,,,"Reducing waste streams at our facilities is a particular focus of our global Green Teams, which collaborate to engage employees, increase recycling rates and incorporate more reusable and compostable materials in the office."
