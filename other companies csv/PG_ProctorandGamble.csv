to landfill.",,,
,"What we once considered an impossible dream, has become a reality.",,,
,"Working closely with our Global Asset Recovery Purchases (GARP) team, we found a second life use for our manufacturing waste, helping P&G save more than $2.2 billion while diverting more than 6.9 million tons from going to landfill.",,,
,"In 2020, we are proud to celebrate with our teams around the world that ALL of our 100+ manufacturing sites across 38 countries have been qualified as zero manufacturing waste to landfill, meeting our ‘100% of sites’ commitment set in 2016.",,,
,"In every location, our “Waste Champions” have helped transform our processes with changes to the way we operate, clever uses for repurposing materials, and sharing learnings to be reapplied.",,,
,"Not only have our plants become more efficient, we’re positively impacting local communities while reducing our environmental footprint.Waste Argentina AustriaBelgiumBrazilCanadaChileChinaColombiaCzech Republic EgyptFranceGermanyHungaryIndiaIndonesiaIrelandItalyJapanMalaysiaMexicoMoroccoNigeriaPakistanPeruPhilippinesPolandRomaniaRussian Federation Saudi ArabiaSingaporeSouth AfricaSpainThailandTurkeyUkraineUnited Kingdom United StatesVietnamCountries that are ZMWTL 100% of P&G plants are now zero manufacturing waste to landfill.SUPPLY CHAIN 121 P&G China Reduces Waste in Shipping Footprint Since 2017, P&G has led the FMCG industry in China to create and expand our Ship In Own Container (SIOC) packaging as e-commerce continues to grow in importance, requiring protection for products during transportation.",,,
,"Traditionally, companies have protected their shipping products with multiple boxes, which requires significant material use and cost.",,,
,"However, the SIOC innovation uses tailored corrugated cardboard boxes and trays to cut down on material use while maintaining protection during shipping and enhancing the consumer experience.",,,
,"The resulting design helps reduce material complexity and waste, cuts end-to-end cost by 20% to 40%, improves fulfillment center picking and packing productivity by 200%, reduces damage and leakage rates during shipping by 70% and eliminates 30% to 60% of paperboard in the packaging.",,,
,"Starting in 2019, P&G China partner-shipped with our e-commerce customer and supplier to develop the package circular system.",,,
,"P&G is the first FMCG company to launch the reusable shipper to replace the traditional shipper of paperboard, shipping from P&G to our customer.",,,
,"In the past 10 months, we have shipped more than 120,000 cases of the reusable shipper in China.",,,
,We continue to create new generation Reusable Shipper 2.0 and expand the circular network to all e-commerce customers and Walmart in FY2021.,,,
,We are rolling out more than three million cases of reusable package in the next 12 months.,,,
,"With this P&G go-to-market package innovation, we not only created value for consumers and customers, we also reduced more than 6000 tons of paperboard usage a year.Waste Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill (ZMWTL) Milestones 2007Set the vision to see “waste as worth.” Formed the Purchasing GARP team and the Product Supply Waste Team 2008Budapest (Feminine Care) becomes our first ZMWTL site — setting a lighthouse for others to follow 2009Reading becomes P&G's first technical site to achieve ZMWTL 2010Coevorden (Pet Care), Athens (DC), and Aleksandrow (Beauty) show zero waste is possible across a wider range of processes and brands 2015 Nearly 50% of our sites reach zero waste 2016P&G sets an even more ambitious goal, to achieve ZMWTL across 100% of our global production sites by 2020.",,,

,"Reusable Shipper 2.0 reduced more than 6,000 tons of paperboard usage a year.SUPPLY CHAIN 122 Waste Store Displays that Embrace Circularity Point of Sale Material (POSM) are advertising materials that are used to communicate product information to the consumers at the point of sale.",,,
,"These include freestanding display units, shelf signs, leaflet dispensers and more.",,,
,"While having a proven record for driving up sales, these materials often end up in a landfill or incinerator after stores use them.",,,
,"Together with our vendors and retail customers, P&G Europe is committed to transforming our portfolio into sustainable POSM, i.e., reducing the footprint on climate and waste, while still growing the category.",,,
,A nice example of this transformative partnership was the Hackathon on Sustainable POSM.,,,
,"This event, which was hosted by P&G and held in Brussels last March, included vendors — both start-up and industry players — who pitched their solutions to several companies and retailers, which turned out to be a source of inspiration and a real accelerator of several pilot projects.",,,
,"In order to compare the footprint of multiple solutions, as well as track progress with our vendors, we introduced the Sustain Score from Popai, an industry-wide tool measuring sustainable design.",,,
,"This helped identify ways to make store materials more sustainable, including paper sourcing accreditation for responsible forestry, reduction of single-use plastic and the development of a winning business model for a circular display.",,,

,"12 Safe use of botanicals in beauty products IMMEDIATE ALLERGY SAFETY Type I allergy is where the human body produces IgE allergic antibodies in response to a foreign substance (an ‘allergen’), leading to an inflammatory response and the development of symptoms such as conjunctivitis, hives, asthma, or anaphylaxis.",,,
,"This can be triggered via four main routes of exposure to an allergen; inhalation, ocular, dermal and systemic (Krutz et al., 2019).",,,
,"Allergens are often specific proteins, and each protein can be assigned a level of allergenic potential.",,,
,"A protein can be considered to have a low allergenic potential if there is evidence of ongoing human exposure without reports of an allergic reaction (Krutz et al., 2019).",,,
,"Databases such as Allergome can also be used to understand whether the structure of particular proteins contains any IgE-binding antigens, the lack of which would provide good evidence for the lack of allergenicity.",,,
,"Proteins with a higher molecular weight (>2.5 kDa, or 20-30 amino acids) should be considered potential allergens unless there is significant evidence to the contrary.",,,
,A pragmatic approach to reducing this effect is avoiding known sources of allergens.,,,
,"If possible, botanicals with a low protein content should be used, unless the protein is the functional bioactive component (Troyano et al., 2011).",,,
,"For example, P&G generally avoid using globally recognised food allergens, such as tree nuts, celery, and sesame seeds, in their beauty products (Troyano et al., 2011), as they could elicit a response in individuals already sensitised (allergic) to these foods.",,,
,"One of the most common routes of exposure by which beauty products can cause Type I allergy is through direct inhalation of aerosols, such as deodorant and hair spray.",,,
,"It is also possible to indirectly inhale more viscous topical products, such as shampoos, conditioners, and body washes, when small amounts combine with fine water vapour in the shower.",,,
,"There have also been cases where residual topical body moisturisers, applied to the body the day before, have atomised off the skin in the shower the next morning and been inhaled (Kelling et al., 1998).",,,
,Botanical ingredients intended for use in direct spray products and/or used (e.g.,,,
,shampoo) or washed off in the shower (e.g.,,,
,body lotion) are tested for total protein content and the resulting protein exposure must be lower than the allergy benchmark before they are included in a beauty product.,,,
,"Proposed protein exposure should be below the protective allergy benchmark of 0.1 ng/m 3 (Troyano et al., 2011).",,,

,,,We’re also advancing plans to move our Palm Oil Derivatives to RSPO Segregated (SG) by the end of 2020.,
,,,"Until that time, we will maintain our Palm Oil derivatives to be RSPO Mass Balance (MB) Certified.",
,,,"Our ability to achieve that may be influenced by broader market dynamics and supply availability, but we have already engaged with our suppliers on plans to achieve this goal.",
,,,This is consistent with our belief that it is the demand for palm oil that is driving forest conversion and peat land pressures and the greatest impacts can be achieved by industry placing a disproportionate focus on driving sustainable palm oil production practices across all categories and regions that use palm oil.,
,,,Learn more about why we are moving to RSPO SG PO.,
,,,"Palm Kernel Oil We use ingredients derived from Palm Kernel Oil and Palm Kernel Oil Derivatives in Fabric Care, Home Care, Hair Care and Skin & Personal Cleansing products.",

,,,,"2018 Citizenship Report Message from the CEO Dear Stakeholders, We made significant progress in each area of P&G’s Citizenship work in fiscal year 2018, and we continue to actively build Citizenship into how we deliver our business results."
,,,,Our aspiration is clear.
,,,,We want to be a force for good and a force for growth.
,,,,"We know that the more we integrate and build Citizenship into how we do business, the bigger the impact we can have on the people we serve, the communities where we live and work and the broader world that surrounds us."
,,,,"In turn, this helps us grow and build our business."
,,,,"We continue to make positive impact in each area of Citizenship: Ethics & Corporate Responsibility, Community Impact, Diversity & Inclusion, Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability."
,,,,"Importantly, our efforts in these areas support nearly every objective outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals."
,,,,"Here are a few highlights from the last fiscal year: • Along with our NGO relief partners, we helped those impacted by disasters around the world."
,,,,"For example, we provided more than 2,000 personal care kits and washed more than 2,300 loads of laundry to help those impacted by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria."
,,,,"We also activated our emergency response efforts to aid victims of the earthquake in Mexico and assisted with Syrian refugees in France, Germany and Turkey."
,,,,"And while this report is on a fiscal year basis, it’s important to note that we’re actively involved in relief efforts for those affected by recent natural disasters in the U.S. and Indonesia.• Our Children’s Safe Drinking Water Program delivered more than one billion liters of clean drinking water last fiscal year and has provided more than 14 billion liters of water to those who need it most since the program began in 2004."
,,,,"• We increased representation for women, now at 46% of all P&G managers globally, and we increased our U.S. representation and workplace satisfaction of African Ancestry, Hispanic and Asian Pacific American employees."
,,,,"• We used our voice in advertising to promote important conversations about a full range of equality, diversity and inclusion topics with the “The Talk,” “Love Over Bias” and “The Words Matter.” We sparked important conversations to motivate positive change along racial, ethnic, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability and gender lines."
,,,,"• And, we established a new road map to drive sustainability into how we operate to achieve positive impact through our brands, supply chain, society and our employees."
,,,,"This includes making all packaging recyclable or reusable, strengthening trust with our consumers by sharing our safety science across our brands, cutting greenhouse gas emissions from our manufacturing sites in half and continuing to help stem the flow of plastic into the world’s oceans."
,,,,"This work could not have been accomplished without P&G people who come to work every day ready to make a difference in the lives of people everywhere and the many contributions of our business partners.For more than 180 years, P&G has been touching and improving lives."
,,,,It’s who we are.
,,,,It’s what we do.
,,,,And it motivates us to do more and be a force for good and a force for growth in the world.

,,,,"11Our Commitment to Respect Human Rights In 2014, P&G published its Human Rights Policy Statement that communicates our support for the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights , which are drawn from and reinforce the principles of internationally recognized human rights consisting of: those rights expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights (i.e., Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and Civil and Political Rights) and the principles concerning fundamental rights as set out in the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work .We recognize that it is the sovereign state’s duty to protect against human rights abuses by establishing and upholding appropriate laws and policies."
,,,,"We also recognize that some states do not have adequate legal and regulatory frameworks, enforcement mechanisms or have laws that conflict with these internationally recognized human rights."
,,,,"Wherever this is the case, we will always try to do the right thing by respecting human rights consistently across our global operations."
,,,,"We expect these same commitments to be shared by our business partners, and we strongly encourage our business partners to share these same expectations with their business partners."
,,,,Child Labor We do not permit the exploitation of children and do not use child labor in any of our global facilities.
,,,,We take this commitment very seriously.
,,,,"In 2014, we learned that children were picking postconsumer waste from landfills, which ultimately made its way to our upstream corrugate supply chain."
,,,,"Since then, we have stayed engaged with our corrugate supply chain and used our leverage to enable suppliers to address the issue and provide remedy to the children and their families."
,,,,"Remedy included, for example, establishing schools, enrolling and supporting affected children in the schools, launching mobile health clinics, developing skilled workshops and compensating parents for loss of income."
,,,,We participated in a panel session at the 2016 UN Forum on Business and Human Rights to highlight how responsible corporate engagement can be a strong force for advancing the cause of human rights.
,,,,"12Our Commitment to Respect Human Rights Forced Labor P&G supports The Consumer Goods Forum Priority Industry Principles , which state: Forced labor is an unacceptable human rights violation that can take multiple forms and must be addressed."
,,,,"While certain employment and recruitment practices may not initially appear problematic, in aggregate or combined with other forms of leverage, they can result in forced labor, particularly among vulnerable workers."
,,,,"We will take active measures to apply these Principles across our global value chains and our operations, to cases where such practices may lead to forced labor."
,,,,"We will seek to apply these Principles to all workers regardless of their employment status, location, contractual arrangements or role."
,,,,We do this as part of our collective journey to advance the human rights of workers and positively shape global labor markets aspiring that: I.
,,,,Every worker should have freedom of movement.
,,,,"The ability of workers to move freely should not be restricted by their employer through abuse, threats and practices such as retention of passport and valuable possessions."
,,,,II.
,,,,No worker should pay for a job.
,,,,"Fees and costs associated with recruitment and employment should be paid by the employer, not the employee."
,,,,III.

,,,,"Once a product is marketed, we monitor how people use it and investigate new scientific information."
,,,,We also collaborate with external scientists and regulatory agencies to share information and understand new safety methods and approaches.
,,,,"These insights help us evolve our safety approaches and keep pace with the latest data so we can continue to ensure we offer safe products for consumers and families everywhere.When it comes to people’s home and family, we know they seek more information to help them feel safe and to choose what’s best for them."
,,,,"That’s why we’re committed to providing information that is clear, reliable and accessible—what goes into our products, what gets left out and why."

,,,,These goals seek to address two of the world’s most pressing environmental challenges: finite resources and growing consumption.
,,,,103HIGHLIGHTS Ambition 2030 We’ve made strong progress against our 2020 goals and the time was right to raise the bar.
,,,,So this year we launched our new 2030 goals — Ambition 2030 — aimed to enable and inspire positive impact while creating value for consumers and our Company.
,,,,"These goals focus on where we know we can make the biggest positive difference — our brands, our supply chain, society and our employees."
,,,,"People know us through our brands, and we will use the power of our innovation and our brands to delight consumers and drive positive impact."
,,,,"In our supply chain, we will reduce our footprint and strive for circular solutions."
,,,,"We can impact society by creating the right partnerships that enable people, the planet and our business to thrive, and this includes finding solutions so that none of our packaging finds its way to the ocean."
,,,,"And finally, we will tap into our greatest resources, our employees, so that they are engaged and equipped to build sustainability into their daily work and our communities."
,,,,104HIGHLIGHTS A Power Play Our energy team has worked hard to deliver renewable onsite projects like a combined heat and power biomass facility in Georgia and offsite partnerships like our wind farm in Texas that have put us on track to deliver our current targets.
,,,,"Building off their progress, we’ve stepped that up for 2030."
,,,,We’ve agreed to purchase 100% renewable electricity and will do this in North America by 2020 and globally by 2030.
,,,,"We have also committed to reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, using 2010 as a baseline."
,,,,"This science-based target aligns with climate science, and it will help us do our part to reduce the impact of climate change."
,,,,P&G will purchase 100% renewable electricity in North America by 2020 and globally by 2030.
,,,,"105HIGHLIGHTS A Sea of Change We understand what’s happening to the world’s oceans, so that is why we have included a plastics pledge in our Ambition 2030 goals."
,,,,We are looking at holistic solutions that will make it possible that no P&G packaging finds its way to the ocean.
,,,,"We are reducing the plastic we use, increasing recycled content and the recyclability of our packaging, and leveraging innovation and partnerships to help stop the flow of plastic into our oceans."
,,,,Our brands are bringing this to life: Limited-edition H&S and Fairy bottles in several European countries contain recycled beach plastic.
,,,,"Almost 100% of the packaging used in Charmin, Puffs and Bounty is recyclable."
,,,,"Lenor introduced post- consumer resin into transparent sizes in Europe and enabled the use of 3,100 tons of recycled plastic in 2017."
,,,,P&G is reducing the plastic we use and increasing recycled content and the recyclability of our packaging.
,,,,106HIGHLIGHTS Partnering for Change We know that no one company can do this alone and believe that collaboration will be critical to driving positive change at scale.
,,,,We’ve had some initiatives that we’ve been able to bring to life with our partners.
,,,,"For example, we worked with TerraCycle and Tesco to provide one lucky school in the UK with a playground made with recycled plastic."
,,,,"In Italy, we worked with Carrefour to create a sustainability campaign around beach litter that enabled shoppers to help choose which beach to clean by providing a donation with purchase."
,,,,"In Japan, Febreze partnered with TerraCycle and a national retailer to encourage shoppers to bring in used Febreze car air fresheners to their local shops for recycling."
,,,,These collections were recycled into raw materials used to manufacture safety reflectors which were donated to schools — a great example of bringing the circular economy to life.
,,,,"Febreze, along with our partners TerraCycle and Tesco, gave schools in the UK a chance to win a playground made from recycled plastic."
,,,,107HIGHLIGHTS That’s Not Garbage Our production sites are well on their way to reaching our goal of sending zero manufacturing waste to landfill by 2020.
,,,,"In fact, approximately 85% of our production sites have successfully qualified as Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill sites."
,,,,So how does this happen?
,,,,"It all starts with changing the mindset to see waste not as waste, but as worth."
,,,,"Around the world, our employees have changed their everyday behaviors, partnering with our Global Asset Recovery Purchases (GARP) team to think of creative and innovative ways to find new life for our materials."
,,,,"So instead of sending those suds that don’t meet our specs to the landfill, we sell them to carwashes."
,,,,The scraps from some of our fem care products become cat litter.
,,,,"Old shipping drums are repurposed into artistic waste bins, school benches and tree containers."
,,,,And there is a double benefit — we create a more circular supply chain by avoiding the landfill while also getting revenue for this would-be waste.
,,,,"Since the program started in 2008, it has saved the Company more than $2 billion and has helped divert five million tons of waste from the landfill."
,,,,85% of our plants have achieved our 2020 goal of sending zero manufacturing waste to landfill.

,,,,"115Brand Stories Downy and Lenor – Long Live Fashion Formula When it comes to your clothes, it’s our business to clean and our passion to care—for clothes and the planet."
,,,,"We want to help people take the best care of the clothes they love, so we can collectively reduce the impact clothing has on our planet."
,,,,"We found that by caring for clothes with what we call “the long live fashion formula”—using a high-quality liquid or PODs like Ariel, washing in quick and cold cycles and conditioning with Downy or Lenor—we can quadruple the clothes’ life."
,,,,"In Europe, we tested a typical household laundry basket with this treatment vs. using a competitive powder at a 40 °C cycle and found that we could keep clothes like new for 4x longer than with the alternative treatment."
,,,,"To drive awareness of this within the fashion industry, we attended the Copenhagen Fashion Summit (CFS)."
,,,,"Bert Wouters, VP for the Fabric Enhancer Franchise globally, emphasized to the audience the impact each of us can make by using the right laundry procedure."
,,,,"He shared compelling information, including the fact that if Europeans extended the life of one in five garments by just 10%, that would translate to saving enough carbon to power half a million homes for a year and more than 150 million liters of water from slower-paced clothing production."
,,,,"Hand-Me-Downy In North America, millions of tons of clothing are sent to landfills each year."
,,,,"One of the major reasons this happens is because clothes aren’t well cared for, and they wear out too soon."
,,,,"To help keep clothes in closets and out of landfills, Downy encouraged Canadian families to swap clothes their kids had outgrown through the first “Hand-Me-Downy” program."
,,,,"Downy sent Canadian families kits to host their own clothing swaps, including invitations and bottles of Downy to protect the clothes they love so they can be worn and handed down, not worn out and thrown out."
,,,,"Through the swaps, each family received ‘new to them’ clothes at no cost, and every article of clothing found a new home, proving that caring for clothes is better for wallets and the environment!"
,,,,Oral-B Oral-B wants to help put some power in your toothbrush while also helping the planet.
,,,,Our power brushes have a long lifecycle and are often used by consumers for up to five years before being replaced.
,,,,Electrical brushes use rechargeable batteries as a source of energy and enable a much higher product performance versus disposable batteries.
,,,,This results in longer lifecycle and less waste.
,,,,"Since July 2017, Oral-B has extended its range of products featuring Lithium Ion batteries which significantly increase the lifecycle of the brushes."
,,,,"These batteries are built into most Oral-B power brush models, from the Pro-2000 to our most premium Genius brushes.Using Ariel with quick, cold cycles and conditioning with Downy or Lenor were proven to keep clothes like new for 4x longer."
,,,,"116Circular Supply Chains Circularity has always been a part of our ongoing conservation and environmental footprint reduction efforts within water, waste and renewable energy."
,,,,"However, as we look toward the next decade, we are committed to be both a force for good and a force for growth."
,,,,"As part of that vision, we have embraced the need to create a more circular end-to-end supply chain."
,,,,"To achieve this, we will need to start thinking differently about the incoming materials, manufacturing work process, distribution, and transport of our products."
,,,,"Circularity is not only the right thing to do, it also helps make our operations more efficient and resilient."
,,,,We have established specific targets that we intend to achieve by 2030: 1.
,,,,100% renewable electricity and cut GHG emissions in half at P&G sites 2.
,,,,P&G sites will deliver a 35% increase in water efficiency and source at least five billion liters of water from circular sources 3.
,,,,"Advance at least 10 significant supply chain partnerships to drive circularity on climate, water or wasteTo learn new methods, find creative partners and to accelerate our circular journey, we recently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Circular Economy 100 working group."
,,,,The Circular Economy 100 is a pre-competitive innovation program established to enable organizations to develop new opportunities and realize their circular economy ambitions faster.
,,,,"It brings together corporations, governments and cities, academic institutions, emerging innovators and affiliates in a unique multi-stakeholder platform."
,,,,"Part of our 2030 vision is making a more circular, end-to-end supply chain to improve efficiency and reduce waste."
,,,,117Climate We recognize the scientific consensus linking greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
,,,,"As a global citizen, we are concerned about the negative consequences of climate change and believe action by governments, industry and consumers to reduce emissions to the atmosphere is necessary."
,,,,We are committed to doing our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including adopting science-based targets to ensure we are contributing our fair share.
,,,,We are striving to reduce emissions from our own operations via increased use of renewable energy and have a relentless focus on energy efficiency.
,,,,We are also helping consumers reduce their own emissions through our efforts to convert more machine-washing loads to low-energy cycles.
,,,,"In 2018, we further strengthened our long-term commitment by announcing two new goals as part of our Ambition 2030 framework: • We will reduce our Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% on an absolute basis by 2030 (vs. 2010 baseline)."
,,,,This is our second science-based target and complements our initial science-based target of a 30% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 2020.
,,,,• We will purchase 100% renewable electricity in North America by 2020 and globally by 2030.

,,,,As part of our new Ambition 2030 we have set a stretching new vision of purchasing 100% renewable electricity by 2030 for our global facilities.
,,,,"To jumpstart this program, our team is looking to reach 100% renewable electricity in North America by 2020 (10 years ahead of our global commitment)."
,,,,North America is P&G’s largest consumer market.
,,,,"Purchasing 100% renewable electricity will allow our consumers to know that the brands they have come to know and trust for superior performance and value are also being made at sites that purchase 100% renewable electricity.Our wind farm in Texas (which provides 100% of the electricity needed for our Fabric and Home Care facilities in the U.S. and Canada to produce brands like Tide, Downy, Cascade and Mr. Clean) and an onsite combined heat and power biomass facility in Georgia (which provides 100% of the steam needed to make Bounty and Charmin) continue to remain the shining stars of our renewable energy program."
,,,,"These large- scale partnerships, along with multiple smaller global onsite/offsite projects utilizing solar, geothermal and hydro, have provided key learnings and the foundation for our vision to use 100% renewable energy."
,,,,The biomass facility in Georgia provides 100% of the site’s steam needed to make Bounty and Charmin.P&G will use 100% renewable electricity by 2020.
,,,,121Energy Conservation We continue to make solid progress in reducing our energy footprint.
,,,,"We have improved energy efficiency by 22% since 2010, achieving our 2020 goal several years early."
,,,,The strengths of our energy program rest on three key strategies: 1.
,,,,Operating with zero losses or defects 2.
,,,,Investing in new technologies to improve efficiency and deliver savings 3.
,,,,Leveraging Total Employee Ownership We have an Energy Team that delivers tools and systems integrated with our manufacturing work systems to reduce losses and continuously improve operating efficiency.
,,,,We continue to focus on enabling our people to identify and quickly eliminate losses in energy consumption.
,,,,We are also benchmarking efficiencies internally and externally to determine where we can invest in new technologies to improve base operating efficiencies.
,,,,It’s because of these efforts we have improved energy efficiency by 22% since 2010 which has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in direct savings and reduced emissions.
,,,,A good example of how we bring this to life is at our Louveira plant in Brazil.
,,,,"The plant expanded the loss elimination culture by creating a Sustainability Committee that targeted consumption, reduction and responsibility in each footprint area including energy."
,,,,"The team is made up of employees across all departments and uses the power of Total Employee Involvement to speed up identification, quantification and solutions."
,,,,"Because of the dedicated focus of the team, they were able to analyze data from their operations and implement several projects improving their efficiency."
,,,,"This includes improvements in shutdown practices, roof materials, integrated cooling system controls, vacuum system improvements and drive system efficiencies."
,,,,"Overall, the site has increased energy efficiency 51% since FY 09/10."
,,,,"Energy Success Stories Mechelen Plant, Belgium Another example of these focused efforts can be seen at our Mechelen plant in Belgium."
,,,,The site energy team developed an action plan to improve the energy efficiency of making automatic dish washing pods delivering a 22% reduction vs. the same six month period the previous year.
,,,,"The key areas where they drove efficiency improvements were regular air leak and defect audits, improved production throughput, focused shutdown practices and improved process settings on their air handling systems."
,,,,"“Our site continues to produce high quality product to delight consumers with a reduced environmental impact, contributing to the conservation of natural resources.” – Niels Jacobs, Site Energy Leader Baddi Plant, India We installed an innovative new heat pump at our Gillette blades and razors plant in Baddi, India."
,,,,This allowed the site to save money and exceed goals on energy efficiency improvements and GHG reductions.
,,,,"Amiens Plant, France At our Amiens site in France, where we produce our Ariel, Lenor and other Fabric Care products, we installed electric heat pumps to provide indoor heating and eliminated the need for additional steam generated from fossil fuels."
,,,,"Because this plant uses 100% renewable electricity, the electric heat pumps help reduce our GHG emissions.Our Louveira plant in Brazil improved their efficiency reducing emissions and saving millions of dollars."
,,,,"122Low-Energy Washing The energy used during the machine washing of laundry is one of the biggest impacts on our corporate GHG emissions footprint and, as such, we have been focused on innovating to enable consumers to get clean clothes using less energy."
,,,,Our goal is to have 70% of all global washing machine loads done in low-energy cycles by 2020.
,,,,"This year, we are at 69% thanks to consumer habit changes in machine technology and innovation that gets clothes clean in cold conditions.Innovating to Get Clean in Cold We continued to innovate all our detergent formulas for best performance in low-energy cycles."
,,,,"In North America, this year we further increased sales of Tide HE Turbo, which is specifically designed to perform well in the strongly growing segment of HE machines and shorter washing conditions."
,,,,We introduced a new enzyme into our Tide detergents that we co-developed with Novozymes.
,,,,This amylase enzyme is specifically designed to work well in low temperatures—meaning it can work quickly to attack tough stains in even the coldest washing conditions.
,,,,"More than 40 specialized scientists from around the globe worked for nearly two years, applying leading techniques in enzyme optimization, including 3D computer modeling, advanced data analytics and high throughput robotic systems to evaluate hundreds of thousands of enzyme molecules."
,,,,This process continued until the team finally identified a winning enzyme that could perform in both cold and quick conditions.
,,,,"“Arctic,” as this enzyme is named, is inspired by the frigid and challenging conditions of the arctic waters and tundra."
,,,,"Arctic is a fast and efficient, biodegradable cold-water enzyme, making it perfect for use in Tide.Our goal is to have 70% of all washing machine loads done in low-energy cycles by 2020."
,,,,We partnered to create a new enzyme specifically designed to work well in low-temperature washing.
,,,,"123Low-Energy Washing Steps in the Right Direction With a strongly growing high-efficiency washing machine segment in North America, we focused particularly on ensuring that HE machine users have the best possible outcome in energy-efficient cycles through Tide HE Turbo Clean and education on the use of quick and cold cycles."
,,,,"We also continued to grow and support our plant- based laundry detergent, Tide purclean, which offers great cleaning performance even at low temperatures."
,,,,"Tide purclean is USDA-certified bio-based and has 4x the cleaning power of the leading natural detergent.1 Due to its ‘no compromise performance’, it was recently awarded the Environmental Leader’s Product of the Year."
,,,,Ariel has been at the forefront of driving consumer behavior change when it comes to washing at cold temperatures with our long-running ‘Turn to 30⁰’ campaign.
,,,,"It was why, this year, Ariel partnered with WWF UK to encourage people to make a promise for the planet in line with Earth Hour."
,,,,"People were asked to make one of seven pledges to protect the planet, one of which was “turn down washing temperatures to 30⁰.” For every pledge made with #PromiseForThePlanet and #EarthHourUK, Ariel donated one euro to WWF UK."
,,,,"Across March and April, the campaign reached more than 326 million people, and WWF UK saw more than 58,000 pledges made across the country."
,,,,"Almost a quarter of these pledges were to turn down washing temperatures to 30 °.As in previous years, we continue to partner with top washing machine manufacturers globally to help educate consumers about the benefits of quick and cold water washing cycles and will again reach about 18 million households next fiscal year."
,,,,"We believe low-energy cycles are not only a win for the environment but a win for consumers, since colder, shorter cycles mean saving on energy bills and reducing damage to clothes from long, high-temperature cycles."
,,,,"While there will always be some loads washed at higher temperatures, we expect the trend towards more energy-efficiency cycles to continue over the coming years."
,,,,"Given that, we will remain focused on enabling consumers to adopt more sustainable, low-energy washing habits without compromising on the clean they need."
,,,,1 One dose Tide purclean vs. four doses leading natural detergent.
,,,,Our “Turn to 30°” campaign asked people to make pledges to turn down washing temperatures to 30° to reduce their energy consumption.
,,,,124Renewable Materials We are continuing our efforts to develop the ability to replace our top fossil-derived materials with renewable materials.
,,,,"We have identified cleaning agents, resins and acrylates as our top fossil-derived materials."
,,,,We have previously reported on establishing our ability to replace resins and cleaning agents with renewably-derived materials.
,,,,We have now established this capability for acrylates.
,,,,Acrylates are a key constituent of the superabsorbent materials used in our absorbent hygiene products.
,,,,We have developed two technologies to produce renewable superabsorbent polymers from lactic acid which have identical properties as fossil-derived superabsorbent polymers.
,,,,"These patented technologies have been demonstrated at lab scale, and we are currently seeking to license these technologies to external parties with hopes of enabling production and commercialization at scale."
,,,,"Now that we have achieved our goal, we will look for opportunities to utilize these materials as cost and scale permit."
,,,,Two examples of our use of bio-resin are highlighted to the right.Tampax and Pampers Tampax recently launched a 90% plant-based plastic tampon applicator on its Cotton Comfort line in France and Pure & Clean line at Target (U.S.).
,,,,This innovative material is made from sustainably-sourced sugarcane from our supplier Braskem® in Brazil.
,,,,P&G also sources this bioplastic for use in Pampers Pure.
,,,,The sugarcane is converted into ethanol and eventually into plastic utilizing a by-product from the rest of the plant to provide some of the energy needed to fuel this process.
,,,,"The sugarcane is certified to the Bonsucro® standard, which has a mission to ensure that responsible sugarcane production creates lasting value for people, communities, businesses, economies and ecosystems."
,,,,"Also, the “I’m Green™” bioplastic production processes are certified by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC Plus), an international certification system for biomass and sustainable fuels that sets specific production standards."
,,,,"The sustainable innovations in Tampax and Pampers to include sustainably sourced bio-materials supports our 2020 goal to “develop the capability to replace petroleum-derived raw materials with renewable materials as cost and scale permit.” The use of sustainable bio-polyethylene from sugarcane is the result of years of research and partnership with World Wildlife Fund, the Bioplastic Feedstock Alliance and other research partners."
,,,,"After years of research, Tampax and Pampers use sustainably sourced bio-polyethylene from sugarcane."
,,,,"125Reduce Packaging By 20% Per Consumer Use Our goal is to reach 20% reduction per consumer use in packaging, and this year we were able to achieve a slight increase of 0.5% against our goal despite significant external headwinds impacting our results."
,,,,We have now achieved a reduction of 13.5% vs. our 2010 baseline.
,,,,The primary challenge we face in this area is customer requests for smaller case counts which require an increase in our use of corrugate (shipping boxes).
,,,,"Corrugate is renewable, has a high recycle content and is recycled at a high rate—all of which help to mitigate impacts from increased use of corrugate."
,,,,"While we are proud of the significant reduction in packaging we have achieved so far and will continue our efforts to reduce even further, current headwinds are such that it will be very difficult for us to achieve our original target by 2020."
,,,,Double the Use of Recycled Resin in Plastic Packaging We have committed to double the use of recycled resin in our plastic packaging.
,,,,"This year, we used approximately 38,100 metric tons of post-consumer resin (PCR) in our plastic packaging, which represents an increase of approximately 46% vs. baseline."
,,,,"Our goal is to get to 52 kiloton of recycled resin, and we have identified several projects that we believe will help us deliver our goal."
,,,,"We are currently working with our business units to ensure we have adequate time to execute the needed projects by 2020.Ensuring 90% of Our Packaging is Recyclable or There Are Programs In Place to Develop the Ability to Recycle It For FY17/18, 86% of our packaging is considered recyclable, and we are working hard to continue to optimize the designs and advance the recycling infrastructure."
,,,,"We continue to expand many of our brand programs, including the shrink sleeve wrap for Lenor in the UK and Air Care recyclability program with TerraCycle, for example."
,,,,"A new program was announced this year, Materials Recovery for the Future, that has the potential to introduce new materials into the recyclability stream."
,,,,We are also encouraging consumers to increase recycling of our packaging by expanding use of the How2Recycle label across our brands in North America.
,,,,"During FY17/18, our use of plastic packaging was approximately 55% polyethylene, 15% polypropylene and 10% PET."
,,,,The remainder consisted of mixed and other plastics.
,,,,"During FY18/19, we will continue our efforts on the goals listed above and will be developing additional perspective on our use of plastics which we will share in our next report.Packaging 86% of our packaging is considered recyclable."
,,,,"126Packaging Materials Recovery for the Future We are taking a leadership role working in collaboration with other brands, retailers and recyclers on a research pilot called Materials Recovery for the Future (MRFF)."
,,,,The goal of the pilot is to test the technical and economic feasibility of adding lightweight flexible plastic packaging formats to municipal recycling so that one day consumers can simply place this packaging in their curbside recycling with other recyclables.
,,,,"In 2016 and 2017, we studied how flexible plastic packaging flows in a recycling system, what equipment is most efficient to sort it and what products could be made from the recycled material."
,,,,"We also selected a recycling facility partner—JP Mascaro Sr. and his team at TotalRecycle, a state-of-the-art, family-owned business in Berks County, PA serving municipalities throughout the state."
,,,,"In 2018 and 2019, we will continue to work with our MRFF partners and JP to upgrade TotalRecycle to sort and bale this packaging as a new recycled feedstock for product manufacture."
,,,,The data will be available for other communities and facilities interested in upgrading their facilities to recycle flexible packaging.Pantene Success Story P&G’s Eastern European Team delivered exceptional value via partnership with the Beauty Care Business Unit to reduce waste and improve recyclability.
,,,,The team replaced plastic gift set trays with pulp trays that were not only made of recycled paper but are also fully biodegradable.
,,,,"This innovation allowed P&G to increase our use of recycled fiber while saving 48,000m3 of water and 960,000 kW of electricity."
,,,,Researchers and P&G’s Steve Sikra sort through packaging to be recycled.
,,,,Our new pulp gift set trays are made of recycled paper and are fully biodegradable.
,,,,"127Responsible Forestry Forests are critical to earth’s ecosystem and to the plants, animals and human communities that depend of them."
,,,,"The world’s forests hold the potential to mitigate some of the most important threats we face, such as climate change, but they remain under pressure from population increases and economic demands."
,,,,One of the easiest ways to counteract threats to forests is by looking for and purchasing wood products which are sourced from responsibly managed forests and tree plantations.We have maintained our commitments to ending and reversing deforestation by sourcing wood products certified to leading international forest certification standards.
,,,,"Earlier this year, we announced new near- and long-term commitments, included in our Ambition 2030 goals, to protect and enhance the forests we depend on."
,,,,"Specifically, we intend to increase the area of certified forests globally, while working to strengthen leading certification systems."
,,,,"In addition, we will play a leadership role in developing a collaborative science- based Forest Positive approach that supports sustaining and expanding working forests that we and others depend on."
,,,,"Although we do not own or manage commercial forests, many of our products and packages are dependent on raw materials from forest-based supply chains."
,,,,"Therefore, we play a key role through our procurement and manufacturing practices to ensure the sustainability of the world’s forest resources."
,,,,"Wood pulp for tissue/towel and absorbent hygiene products, wood fibers used in paper packaging, and palm oil for our laundry and beauty products are strategic commodities where our sourcing practices have the greatest impact on ensuring responsible use of the world’s forest resources."
,,,,Each of these materials has a different supply chain and their unique complexities led us to develop individual programs as described in the following sections.We are striving to protect and enhance the forests we depend on.
,,,,"128Responsible Forestry Wood Pulp Supply Chains Procurement Policy As part of our procurement practices, we require that all wood used for pulp supplied to us has undergone a risk assessment in accordance with the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) Controlled Wood standard."
,,,,The FSC Controlled Wood risk assessments ensure that unwanted wood sources are avoided and that wood harvesting is done legally per our procurement policy.
,,,,"We have a preference for FSC, which makes use of both FSC Chain of Custody (FSC COC) and Controlled Wood (FSC CW) inputs."
,,,,We require that the forest certification systems utilized by our wood pulp suppliers adhere to the following criteria for responsible forest management: • Ensure the safety of forestry and manufacturing operations for employees and the environment.
,,,,• Ensure that unwanted wood sources are avoided and that wood is legally harvested and that all legal requirements are met.
,,,,P&G will not knowingly use illegally sourced materials in our products.
,,,,• Ensure that their supply chain incorporates the principles of responsible forest management and continuous improvement in their own operations and that they are verified by independent forest and chain- of-custody certification.• Ensure that trees are not harvested from high- conservation-value forests unless they are credibly certified to the most rigorous forest management standards.
,,,,P&G supports multi-stakeholder efforts to develop information sources and tools that will help suppliers identify these areas on their own forestlands and in their procurement of wood raw materials from third parties (e.g.
,,,,www.hcvnetwork.org ).
,,,,• Ensure that there is no sourcing from genetically modified trees in pulp delivered to us.
,,,,"• Ensure that their own and their supplier practices reflect our social values and support of universal human rights through work with local governments and communities to improve the educational, cultural, economic and social well-being of those communities."
,,,,• Ensure that their supply chain used to produce our pulp does not contain fiber from conflict timber (timber that was traded in a way that drives violent armed conflict or threatens national or regional stability).Third-Party Certification 100% of the virgin wood pulp we purchase for use in our tissue/towel and absorbent hygiene products is third-party certified by one of our accepted forest certification programs.
,,,,We give preference to FSC® certified pulp when it is available and meets product performance and business requirements.
,,,,"FSC certification protects water, wildlife and local people by ensuring forests are responsibly managed."
,,,,FSC standards are recognized worldwide as the most stringent forest management certification scheme and are supported by leading international environmental NGOs.
,,,,"Based on the market availability of certified pulp, P&G’s supply chain will also source from other third- party forestry certification systems."
,,,,They include: • Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) • Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI) • Brazilian Forest Certification Programme (CERFLOR) • Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Group • Sustainable Forest Management System (SFM) We prefer FSC certified pulp because the certification ensures forests are responsibly managed.
,,,,"129Responsible Forestry Pulp for Our Tissue/Towel and Absorbent Hygiene Products In fiscal year 17/18, we purchased 1.5 million metric tons of air-dried pulp for use in our tissue/towel, diaper and absorbent hygiene products."
,,,,"The pulp was sourced from the following countries and used the following third-party certified fiber:Working Together to Make a Difference P&G is a proud participant in World Wildlife Fund’s (WWF®) Global Forest & Trade Network (GFTN), a corporate forum for supporting responsible forest management and forest product sourcing."
,,,,"Many of our projects and activities are inspired by our commitments as participants in GFTN such as: • Continuing to implement our preference for FSC certification, including overall volume increases in FY17/18."
,,,,• Continuing support for efforts to expand group certification for family forest owners in the U.S. with Domtar.
,,,,• Progress in the Coastal Carolinas landowner outreach project.
,,,,• P&G’s efforts at Tissue 2017 Conference & Expo to convene discussions with other companies and NGOs about sustainable forestry and Caribou issues in Canada.
,,,,"FSC Group Certificate Support In 2016, P&G met with the Four States Timberland Owners Association (FSTOA), led by Domtar, to discuss expanding the amount of timberland that is under forest management certification."
,,,,"Together, we are committed to lowering the technical and financial hurdles to increasing forest certification in family-owned forests through Domtar’s FSTOA FSC group certificate."
,,,,"Our participation supported the growth in certified lands, and we continue to support the operation and expansion of the association."
,,,,"The FSTOA is now working towards having 600,000 acres of timberland under FSC group certification."
,,,,"We are a proud participant of WWF’s Global Forest & Trade Network, working with partners that support responsible forest management.Country of Origin % of Total Argentina 1% Brazil 34% Canada 33% United States 32% Total 100% Certification System % of Total FSC COC 37% FSC CW 7% PEFC 30% SFI 26% Total 100% FSC COC — FSC Chain of Custody FSC CW — Controlled WoodP&G’s Charmin toilet tissue and Puffs facial tissue products are FSC certified by Rainforest Alliance."
,,,,"130Responsible Forestry Carolinas Working Forest Conservation Collaborative Update In May 2016, we helped launch the Carolinas Working Forest Conservation Collaborative (CWFCC), a collection of organizations led by the American Forest Foundation working together to help family forest owners manage their land sustainably."
,,,,"The current project area consists of 5,946,494 acres, almost three times larger than our original goal of 2.4 million acres."
,,,,"Because of the early success of the program, all the original goals have been expanded."
,,,,"For example, the project is now looking to reach out to almost four times as many forest owners and directly engage twice the number of forest owners in workshops and field days to increase knowledge of forest stewardship and practices."
,,,,"We are pleased with the early success of the program which enjoys the direct support of more than 20 leading international, national and regional conservation organizations."
,,,,"Paper Packaging We continually strive to optimize the design of our packaging aiming to use the least amount of material, while ensuring adequate protection, delivery and safe use of our products."
,,,,"As part of our ongoing efforts, we continue to identify source reduction opportunities to decrease overall material usage and to use recycled paper when it offers the best option to meet performance and business requirements."
,,,,"Our paper-based packaging is derived from wood fiber, and we have a responsibility through our procurement practices to ensure that the wood fiber in our packaging has been responsibly sourced."
,,,,"We have made a specific commitment that by 2020, 100% of our paper packaging will contain either recycled or third-party-certified virgin content."
,,,,"Over the last year, we have expanded our efforts to collect data from an increased number of suppliers to assess progress against this goal."
,,,,"This year, we have received data from more than 100 suppliers that represent more than 95% of our global paper packaging spend."
,,,,"This data, which was self-reported by our suppliers, is summarized in the following table: This year, 98.5% of the volume reported by our suppliers was either recycled or third-party-certified virgin content."
,,,,That means less than 2% of the reported volume was virgin material that was not third-party- certified.
,,,,We also experienced a 12% reduction in the total metric tons because of initiatives to reduce our overall use of paper board.
,,,,"Over the course of the next years, we will remain focused on working with our suppliers to get to our goal of 100%.Total volume in metric tons ~700,000 % Recycled 85% % Virgin 15% % of virgin fiber that was third-party-certified91% % of total recycled or third-party-certified virgin98.5%By 2020, 100% of our paper packaging will contain either recycled or third-party-certified virgin content."
,,,,"131Palm Oil Palm Oil (PO) is an important, versatile and highly efficient vegetable oil that is used as a raw material by both food and non-food industries."
,,,,"In some regions of the world, the rapid expansion of PO production has threatened environmentally sensitive areas of tropical forests and peat lands and has resulted in incidents where the rights of independent smallholder farmers and indigenous peoples have been infringed."
,,,,We are committed to ensuring that our sourcing of palm oil does not contribute to deforestation and respects the rights of workers and indigenous peoples.
,,,,We are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and support their standards to drive responsible palm practices across the industry.
,,,,"In addition, we have established a robust approach to ensuring the responsible sourcing of palm-derived materials which includes supplier management, improving lives of smallholders and industry influence.Palm Oil Procurement Policy P&G is committed to ensuring our suppliers meet RSPO Principles and Criteria (P&C) and have the necessary policies and procedures in place to ensure: • No development of high-conservation-value (HCV) areas and high-carbon-stock* (HCS) forests • No new development of peat lands regardless of depth • No burning to clear land for new development or replanting • Compliance with P&G’s existing Sustainability Guidelines for External Business Partners • Respect for human and labor rights • Respect for land tenure rights, including rights of indigenous and local communities to give or withhold their free, prior and informed consent for development of land they own legally, communally or by custom."
,,,,All of our suppliers have submitted their relevant policies and procedures to demonstrate how they will meet our requirements.
,,,,"If we find a supplier is violating any of the above requirements, and if that supplier does not acknowledge and take action to resolve the concern, P&G will suspend or eliminate palm oil purchases from that supplier."
,,,,A supplier would need to have a documented action plan and demonstrate meaningful progress to be considered for reinstating supply agreements.
,,,,*The High Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA) Toolkit should be applied to identify and conserve HCS forests.
,,,,We have been supporting inclusion of HCSA to the 2018 RSPO P&C and are expecting to incorporate the revised P&C for verifying our commitments.
,,,,We are working with our palm oil suppliers to ensure responsible sourcing.
,,,,"132Palm Oil Progress During FY17/18, key milestones included: Greatly increased transparency of our supply chain by publishing both palm oil supplier names and a detailed list of the palm oil mills in our supply chain."
,,,,Maintained 100% RSPO certification for palm oil/palm oil derivatives and continued to make progress in our efforts to source 100% of our palm oil as RSPO Segregated (SG) by the end of 2018.
,,,,We remain on track to hit that goal and are developing plans to procure 100% of our palm oil derivatives as RSPO SG by the end of 2020.
,,,,Completed a comprehensive palm oil mill risk assessment to understand which palm oil mills in our supply chain are located in areas considered to be high-risk.
,,,,"Roughly ~7% (~90 mills) were found to be in high-risk locations, and during FY18/19 we will focus on developing additional verification programs for these sites."
,,,,Continued to play a leadership role in multi-stakeholder discussions seeking to advance a consensus approach to assessing High Carbon Stock areas via our participation in the High Carbon Stock Approach Steering Group.Announced a major commitment as part of our Ambition 2030 program to significantly scale our smallholder program which is focused on improving the livelihoods of the smallholder farmers in our supply chain.
,,,,Explored key drivers of land use planning to help us prioritize our efforts.
,,,,You can read key learnings from that exercise here.
,,,,You can read more about the detailed progress in each of our three pillar areas by clicking on the links below.
,,,,"This year, we seeked to gain a better understanding of drivers of land use planning within the palm industry."
,,,,133Palm Oil Pillar I: Supplier Management Palm Oil We use ingredients derived from palm oil and palm oil derivatives in Beauty Care and Fabric Care products.
,,,,"Our major PO and POD suppliers are Wilmar, Golden Agri, Musim Mas and Apical."
,,,,We are proud of our progress on palm oil and are on target to deliver 100% RSPO SG palm oil by the end of 2018.
,,,,We’re also developing plans to move our palm oil derivatives to RSPO Segregated (SG) by the end of 2020.
,,,,"Until that time, we will maintain our palm oil derivatives to be RSPO Mass Balance (MB) Certified."
,,,,"Our ability to achieve that may be influenced by broader market dynamics and supply availability, but we have already engaged with our suppliers on plans to achieve this goal."
,,,,"This is consistent with our belief that it is the demand for palm oil that is driving forest conversion and peat land pressures, and the greatest impacts can be achieved by industry placing a disproportionate focus on driving sustainable palm oil production practices across all categories and regions that use palm oil."
,,,,"Palm Kernel Oil We use ingredients derived from palm kernel oil and palm kernel oil derivatives in some Fabric Care, Home Care, Hair Care and Beauty Care products."
,,,,"Thanks to a unique partnership with the Malaysia Institute for Supply Chain Innovation and FGV, our single largest PKO supplier, we have gained significant visibility to the sourcing plantations and regions of FGV’s PKO supply chain."
,,,,"In fact, we now know that about 96% of our palm kernel oil was sourced from a known subset of FGV’s palm oil mills."
,,,,FGV is currently on a glidepath to re-certify their mills which voluntarily withdrew their RSPO certification in 2016.
,,,,"As FGV progresses their recertification efforts, our percentage of RSPO MB certified PKO will increase."
,,,,This glidepath should drive our RSPO certification levels for a year-on- year increase in certified PKO.
,,,,"Given the complexity of the PKO supply chain and a lack of supply of physically certified PKO, our commitment is to work with our PKO suppliers to aggressively drive year-on-year increases in the percent of physically certified RSPO PKO we buy."
,,,,We are also focusing our smallholder efforts on our PKO supply chain as we know we have a large concentration of smallholders in our Malaysian PKO supply chain.
,,,,"You can read more about those efforts here:Metric Tons*RSPO Certified (%)RSPO MB Certified (%) Palm Oil/Palm Oil Fractions 55,834 100% 94% Palm Oil Derivatives 64,263 100% 95% Metric Tons*RSPO Certified (%)RSPO MB Certified (%) Palm Kernel Oil 317,796 5% 5% Palm Kernel Oil Derivatives 72,164 0% 0%*This represents the total volume of PO and PO derivatives purchased by P&G."

,,,,Approximately 65% of this is used internally by P&G brands.
,,,,The remaining 35% is sold to external parties through our P&G Chemicals division 134Palm Oil Pillar I: Supplier Management Risk Assessment and Verification We expect all suppliers (including their third parties) to fully comply with our Responsible Sourcing policy and will act swiftly to address any allegations of non- compliance.
,,,,"To help inform our efforts on verification of compliance, in FY17/18, we conducted a risk assessment using the PALM Tool (Version 2: Updating the PALM Risk Assessment Methodology."
,,,,"Sargent et al., publication forthcoming) on the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Global Forest Watch Pro (GFW Pro) to identify palm oil mills in our supply base that are at a high risk based on presence of deforestation risk factors in the area surrounding the mill."
,,,,We assessed 1269 mills and identified ~90 (~7%) as high risk.
,,,,The majority of these (>85%) were third party mills used by our direct suppliers.Focus Areas for FY18/19 Concession Maps: We believe that increased transparency on concession maps is an important part of enabling verification and holding suppliers accountable for any violations of their palm policies.
,,,,We require all direct suppliers to be RSPO members.
,,,,"As a result, they are required to publish concession maps for their own lands."
,,,,"In FY18/19, our objective is to work with our direct suppliers to have concession maps of indirect third-party suppliers also published."
,,,,"As a first step, we have asked our suppliers to identify any existing barriers to the publication of concession maps so that we can work with our suppliers and other relevant stakeholders to find solutions for those barriers."
,,,,Verification: We will focus our verification efforts on sourcing areas characterized as high risk per our palm oil mill risk assessment process.
,,,,We will work with relevant suppliers to ensure verification of Responsible Sourcing requirements for high risk locations.
,,,,"As a first step, we will assess the sufficiency of current verification process of all suppliers."
,,,,"Based on those findings, we will develop a glidepath and process for verification of high-risk locations in consultation with relevant suppliers to ensure we have an optimized process that avoids duplication of effort."
,,,,"This year, we conducted a risk-assessment on all 1,269 palm oil mills in our supply base to identify mills at a high deforestation risk."
,,,,"135Palm Oil Pillar II: Smallholders Program As per our Ambition 2030 announcement, we have committed to significantly scale our smallholder program."
,,,,The objective of this program is to improve the livelihood of smallholders while verifying production practices to meet our sourcing criteria.
,,,,The program focuses on the independent smallholders and small growers in our PKO supply chain that supply fresh fruit bunches (FFB) to FGV mills in Malaysia.
,,,,"There are approximately 30,000 smallholders supplying up to 90,000 mT of PKO into this network, and our target is to enable these smallholders to be at or above the national yield average."
,,,,"Pilot Results In FY15/16, we partnered with Wild Asia and Proforest to develop the capability and capacity of smallholders and collection centers in two project sites in Parit Raja and Benut, both located in the western part of the State of Johor, Malaysia."
,,,,The two project sites covered seven collection centers and 2000 smallholders.
,,,,"Together with our project partners, we have developed the P&G Responsible Sourcing Criteria Scorecard for Smallholders to assess smallholders against our criteria."
,,,,"The Scorecard covered six P&G palm sustainability policies: • No development of High Conservation Value (HCV) areas and High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests • No new development of peat lands regardless of depth • No burning to clear land for new development or replanting • Respect for human and labor rights• Respect land tenure rights, including rights of indigenous and local communities to give or withhold their free, prior and informed consent for development of land they own legally, communally or by custom • Traceable supply chain At the end of June 2018, Wild Asia, Proforest and MISI have assessed 560 smallholders against the P&G Responsible Sourcing Criteria for Smallholders."
,,,,We will use the learnings from these initial pilots to help us scale our efforts.
,,,,P&G Oil Palm Data Warehouse Developing full traceability to smallholder farms and growers is an important enabler towards ensuring sustainability of P&G’s complex PKO supply network.
,,,,"To achieve this, we partnered with MIMOS, Malaysia’s national Applied Research and Development Center, to develop the P&G Oil Palm Data Warehouse."
,,,,The Data Warehouse is capable of securely storing and analyzing data collected by our project partners to turn them into useful and actionable information.
,,,,"The Data Warehouse will also be Blockchain-enabled, and we plan to test this with a group of smallholders and collection centers’ dealers."
,,,,Our initial work with MIMOS has showed that our PKO supply network can already be fully traceable to the collection centers which is one step upstream from the mills and one step downstream from smallholder farms and growers.
,,,,A collection center (also referred as FFB dealers) is a place where smallholders sell their FFBs before being transported to mills.
,,,,"By developing traceability to collection centers, we will be able to utilize geospatial technology to understand the environmental landscape within a 10–30 KM radius enabling us to prioritize key collection centers for our smallholders program."
,,,,We plan to complete this traceability exercise before the end of FY18/19.
,,,,We partnered with MIMOS of Malaysia to create a Palm Oil Data Warehouse to store and analyze data from our project partners.
,,,,136Palm Oil Pillar II: Smallholders Program Scaling Efforts: Development of Learning Farms We are partnering with International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) in a multi-year agreement to develop up to 75 core innovator farms and 165 primary innovator farms (together termed as learning farms) by 2020 with the objective of improving the livelihood of smallholders in the P&G palm supply chain in Malaysia.
,,,,"The program will focus on our current project sites in Johor and will provide sustainable intensification of oil palm for independent smallholders in Johor, Malaysia."
,,,,The program will focus on increasing FFB yield by enabling farmer access to knowledge about crop and nutrient best management practice.
,,,,This program has the objective of improving the yields by 30–50% and will drive both livelihood income and ensure sustainable practices in the P&G supply chain.
,,,,"Smallholder Objectives for FY18/19 During FY18/19, we will work to achieve the following objectives: 1."
,,,,Expand the project sites from seven to 32 collection centers and ~8000 smallholders in Johor and develop full traceability to collection centers 2.
,,,,Develop the first 15 core innovator farms 3.
,,,,"Partner with NGOs and universities to develop standardized sustainability training modules and develop a strategy to reach and train up to 1000 smallholdersPillar III: Industry Influence As a member of the High Carbon Stock Approach Steering Group (HCSA SG), RSPO’s Principle & Criteria Taskforce, RSPO’s Smallholder Working Group and RSPO’s Human Rights Working Group, we are collaborating to drive harmonized industry approaches that can help advance shared objectives."
,,,,"Below are descriptions of some of the key collaboration areas: No Deforestation, Peat and Exploitation (NDPE) Policy and the RSPO P&C Enhancing the RSPO Principal & Criteria (P&C) to better align with current NDPE policies represents a significant opportunity to strengthen the P&C and enable and accelerate industry efforts to verify NDPE compliance."
,,,,"As member of HCSA SG and RSPO No Deforestation Interim Group, we are actively participating in the collaborative effort to incorporate both HCSA and an approach for High Forest Cover (HFC) landscape/ countries into the RSPO P&C."
,,,,"Via the RSPO P&C Task Force and Working Groups, we are helping drive integration of no deforestation, no peat development and the broader human, labor and land tenure rights policies into the RSPO P&C."
,,,,A revised version of the RSPO P&C are expected to be approved in November 2018.
,,,,RSPO Smallholder Standard and Inclusion The new RSPO Smallholder Standard is critical to enabling the RSPO smallholder strategy issued in 2017.
,,,,"As a member of the Smallholder Interim Group, we are contributing to developing an inclusive, engaging standard that will drive stepwise, supported improvement of practice and productivity and livelihood of this key supply chain sector into the RSPO system."
,,,,"We also continue to support the 13th, 14th and 15th RSPO Roundtable Meetings in bringing smallholders from multiple regions to join this learning and sharing event."
,,,,We are encouraged by the progress on these important efforts so far but recognize there is still important work to do.
,,,,We will continue to advance the progress and implementation in support of our commitments and industry common goals.

,,,,"While we’ve already announced our next decade of water goals, we are committed to continuing to work towards achieving all three of our 2020 water goals.Goal Progress Reduce water used in P&G manufacturing facilities by 20% per unit of production versus 2010 with conservation focused on water-stressed regions.25% water reduction per unit of production, completion of Tier 2 of our Manufacturing Water Risk Assessment process Provide one billion people with access to water-efficient products.700 million people with access Provide 15 billion liters of clean drinking water to those who need it most.14 billion liters of clean drinking water -26% -25%-25% FY16/17 FY15/16FY17/18Reduction in Water Consumption Percent reduction versus FY09/1 0, per unit of production 6363 62FY17/18 FY16/17 FY15/16Water Consumption by GBU Millions of cubic meters Baby, Feminine & Family Care Beauty Fabric & Home Care Grooming Health Care Other6363 62FY17/18 FY16/17 FY15/16Water Consumption by GBU Millions of cubic meters Baby, Feminine & Family Care Beauty Fabric & Home Care Grooming Health Care Other21 1819FY17/18 FY16/17 FY15/16Wastewater COD* Disposed by GBU Thousands of metric tons Baby, Feminine & Family Care Beauty Fabric & Home Care Grooming Health Care Other*Chemical Oxygen Demand 138Water Reducing Water Use and Focusing Where it Matters Most Water is an essential input at many of our facilities around the world."
,,,,Creating a culture of water efficiency at our sites has been a priority for our manufacturing teams for more than two decades.
,,,,"Thanks to the work of many employees across our global portfolio, we’ve been able to reduce our manufacturing water usage by 25% per unit of production since 2010."
,,,,We continue to exceed our goal of 20% reduction per unit of production and will keep focused on increasing efficiency into the next decade.
,,,,"In combination with our efficiency work, we’ve also continued to move through our Manufacturing Water Risk Assessment process which was developed in partnership with the World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF)."
,,,,"This past year, we completed Tier 2 of our process, which involved working closely with experts at Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to deploy, collect and analyze in-depth site water questionnaires at each of the 40 Tier 2 sites."
,,,,"After a rigorous scoring and ranking process, we found that 24 of our facilities are exposed to high water risk."
,,,,These 24 facilities have been moved into Tier 3 of our assessment process.
,,,,These facilities represent almost every business we operate and span ten unique countries.
,,,,PRIORITY SITES FROM 2 ~15% of sites will complete the Tier 3 processALL SITES SCREENED ~70% of sites in lower-risk regions PRIORITY SITES FROM 1 ~30% of sites have entered the Tier 2 processP&G Tailored Site Questionnaire (Completed) Prioritize sites based on outcome of responses • The P&G questionnaire was built upon the facility questionnaire in WWF’s Water Risk Filter2Water Risk Screening (Completed) Identify risk level of sites based on: • Baseline Water Stress Score — World Resources Institute • Gross National Income per Capita — World Bank • P&G Site Water Use per Year — P&G • Access to Water — WHO/UNICEF1 3In-Depth Site Water Analysis (Current Phase) Prioritize risks for mitigation and develop site water stewardship plans.
,,,,• Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) International Water Stewardship Standard 1.0 steps 1-3.P&G Water Risk Assessment Framework 139Water The Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard Each of the 24 Tier 3 facilities will create site water stewardship plans by the end of 2020.
,,,,"They will do this by following steps 1, 2 and 3 of the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) International Water Stewardship Standard 1.0."
,,,,This standard provides a globally applicable framework for major water users to understand their water use and impacts and to work collaboratively and transparently for sustainable water management within a basin context.
,,,,The AWS Standard will help each site create plans that address risks both inside and outside their four walls.
,,,,It will also help to tie site efforts around water to local water challenges that are being experienced by not only the site but also by others in the same basin.
,,,,"This year, we became a member of AWS and are happy to support the work they do to ensure consistency and credible recognition of good water stewardship practices."
,,,,"P&G Tier 3 Facilities 140Water Pulp & Paper Water Stewardship Water has always been an important focus at the manufacturing facilities that produce our Bounty, Charmin and Puffs products."
,,,,"Those sites are building on their long history of compliance and efficiency measures, to a more holistic water stewardship strategy."
,,,,"As part of this strategy, the business acted in two ways: 1."
,,,,Completed the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard Self-Verification process for a key facility and 2.
,,,,Embarked on a partnership opportunity with a supplier.
,,,,"The AWS Self-Verification was completed at our Oxnard, California facility, already known across the Company for its impressive water savings and water management strategy in a water-stressed region."
,,,,World Wildlife Fund (WWF) guided the site through the AWS Standard and enabled greater understanding of risks and opportunities both inside and outside the plant.
,,,,"As of October 2018, the site has declared itself to meet the AWS global standard for water stewardship.Again, working closely with WWF, we collaborated with our supplier, Fibria, to collect and share our respective water management practices, challenges and solutions to help us, and others in the industry, move beyond compliance and efficiency towards holistic water stewardship."
,,,,Our findings will soon be shared publicly so others can benefit from our experience.
,,,,"Finding Circular Solutions Our Global Fabric Care business, including brands Tide, Gain, Ariel, Ace and Lenor, has been working hard to reduce fresh water use in their manufacturing plants, thus reducing their impact to their local water basins."
,,,,"The various plants have identified and implemented solutions to reduce water use, including capturing and using rain water and reusing utility reject water that would otherwise go to the sewer."
,,,,"Several Fabric Care plants located in Mexico, Pakistan, Czech Republic and the U.S. have found unique circular approaches to beneficially reuse water from one process as feed water into another process."
,,,,"A recent circular example is the Port Qasim plant in Pakistan, which is located within a water-stressed region."
,,,,"Since every drop counts, the plant looked for ways to reduce their absolute fresh water intake by reusing the water used to clean and flush holding tanks back into the manufacturing process."
,,,,Fabric Care continues to look for new circular water sources to reduce their local water impact.
,,,,"We implemented solutions to reduce water use, including capturing and using rain water and reusing water from one process into another process."
,,,,Our family care products are at the forefront of water stewardship in their manufacturing facilities.
,,,,141Water Providing Consumers Access to Water-Efficient Products Our goal is to provide one billion people with access to water-efficient products by 2020.
,,,,"At the end of FY17/18, about 700 million consumers had access to water-efficient products around the world."
,,,,"This year, we qualified two products that enable women to spend less time in the shower: dry shampoos and leave-on treatments."
,,,,"Dry Shampoos In many places around the world, the shower accounts for a large percent of the household’s weekly water use."
,,,,It also adds up to precious hours of time.
,,,,More and more women are finding ways to extend the time between washes.
,,,,One way we’ve enabled them to do this is through our dry shampoos.
,,,,"This product enables consumers to go longer between washes and helps to refresh their hair on days they decide to skip the wash. 50 million people have access to dry shampoos in countries like China, Germany, the U.S. and the UK.Leave-On Treatments We’ve designed products that enable women to skip the rinse out conditioner step in their shower regimen."
,,,,"This allows them to reduce their time in the shower and save water, while still ensuring they have the silky- smooth hair they desire."
,,,,"40 million people have access to leave-on treatments across countries like Mexico, China, Brazil, the U.S and the UK."
,,,,"Clean Water Through Science and Partnership More than a decade ago, a P&G scientist, in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, invented a 4-gram packet that can transform dirty water to clean, drinkable water in only 30 minutes."
,,,,"Today, with the help of more than 150 partners, this technology is delivering clean drinking water to those who need it most."
,,,,Our goal is to provide 15 billion liters of clean water by 2020 through our Children’s Safe Drinking Water (CSDW) Program.
,,,,"This year, we made progress against this goal and have provided more than 14 billion liters of clean water to people around the world since the program began in 2004."
,,,,Our dry shampoos and leave-on treatments help consumers use water more efficiently.
,,,,142Waste We have a vision that one day zero consumer and manufacturing waste will go to landfill.
,,,,"To help lead the way and demonstrate what is possible, our manufacturing sites are on a mission to get to zero waste to landfill now."
,,,,Manufacturing Waste Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill (ZMWTL) We started our Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill program in 2008.
,,,,"At that time, it seemed like an impossible dream as our 100+ manufacturing sites were producing more than one million tons of waste per year."
,,,,"What started as a sustainable movement, to see trash ‘not as waste, but as worth’ has helped transform the way our sites think about raw materials."
,,,,Waste champions across our manufacturing sites and within our Global Asset Recovery Purchases (GARP) team quickly started to find beneficial uses for our waste.
,,,,Not only helping avoid landfills but helping generate revenue at the same time.
,,,,"Since 2008, the team has helped save the Company more than $2 billion and has helped divert more than five million tons of waste from the landfill."
,,,,"Once ~50% of our sites reached ZMWTL (less than two years ago), we decided to look for ways to accelerate our zero-waste journey, setting a stretching target that ALL of our production sites would send Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill by 2020."
,,,,"In the last two years, the waste team has made phenomenal progress, with approximately 85% of our facilities currently being qualified as ZMWTL, well on track to meet our 100% goal by 2020.-79% -79%-81% FY16/17 FY15/16FY17/18Waste Disposed Percent reduction versus FY09/1 0 per unit of production 40 4647FY17/18 FY16/17 FY15/16Solid Waste Non-Hazardous by GBU Thousands of metric tons 71 8278FY17/18 FY16/17 FY15/16Disposed Waste by GBU Thousands of metric tons 2 83FY17/18 FY16/17 FY15/16Solid Waste Hazardous by GBU Thousands of metric tons Baby, Feminine & Family Care Beauty Fabric & Home Care Grooming Health Care Other6363 62FY17/18 FY16/17 FY15/16Water Consumption by GBU Millions of cubic meters Baby, Feminine & Family Care Beauty Fabric & Home Care Grooming Health Care Other 143Waste In addition to individual sites, our waste teams also look for ways to drive ZMWTL across entire business units, countries and regions."
,,,,"This year, our Health Care Business achieved 100% ZMWTL in all their production sites across the globe, joining Fem Care, Oral Care and Grooming in reaching this milestone."
,,,,"Furthermore, our Fabric & Home Care business had a very strong year, going from 50% to 83% of their sites receiving our ZMWTL certification, with 98% of their total waste (production volume) diverted from landfill."
,,,,"We also have two regions close to 100% ZMWTL, Europe and Asia, and we expect them to reach this milestone by this time next year."
,,,,"In total, we now have 26 countries where all our manufacturing sites have qualified as ZMWTL."
,,,,"This year, we qualified 16 more sites, and in the process, saved the Company millions of dollars.18 11 14 11 16 2 2 11 1FY15/1622 FY16/1716 FY17/18 FY14/15 FY13/14 FY12/13 FY11/12 FY10/11 FY9/10 FY8/9 FY7/8 FY6/7Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landﬁll Sites qualiﬁed by FY Belgium Brazil China Czech Republic Egypt France Germany Hungary India Indonesia Ireland Italy Japan MexicoNigeria Pakistan Philippines Poland Romania Singapore South Africa South Korea Spain Turkey United Kingdom VietnamCountries that are ZMWTL 144Waste Global Asset Recovery Purchases (GARP) Our Global Asset Recovery Purchases (GARP) program continues to be a great enabler in our waste efforts as we find innovative ways to reduce waste and disposal costs."
,,,,"Here are some of the innovative solutions GARP has implemented this year: • Our Tepejí Plant in Mexico (Baby Care) worked with an external supplier to recover plastic from the diapers production waste and converts it into plastic pellets that are used as primary raw material to make items like buckets, brooms and other plastic-based goods."
,,,,"• In China, we are beneficially re-using toothpaste as a component for car cleaner, and shampoo/conditioner is re-purposed to help clean pets."
,,,,"• In Canada, our Belleville Plant (Fem Care) is converting our highly absorbent scrap and process waste into various spill mitigation products."
,,,,"• In Brazil, our Baby Care Plant in Louveira is converting our diapers production waste into dog hygienic mats, and hair care and detergent production waste are used as a component for car washes."
,,,,"• Our Oral Care operations are converting toothpaste into car cleaner, toothbrushes and floss into wood plastic composites, and our rinse wash waste is used for biofermentation and plastic recycling industries.Diaper Recycling Fater, a Joint Venture of P&G and Gruppo Angelini in Italy, developed a breakthrough diaper recycling technology that recycles used absorbent hygiene products (baby diapers, fem care and adult incontinence products) to create new products and materials of added value."
,,,,"The technology is now live and operational at industrial scale able to process 10,000 tons of used absorbent hygiene products per year."
,,,,That corresponds to serving around one million people.
,,,,The plant is unique and the first of its kind in the world.
,,,,"We are expanding the technology globally to more markets such as the Netherlands and India, and we are studying many more markets."
,,,,"Finding Value in Waste Febreze, TerraCycle and Tesco partnered to give schools in the UK a chance to win a playground made from recycled plastic."
,,,,Community members were encouraged to get involved and help their local schools win by voting for them in the competition.
,,,,The Febreze Playground competition focused on raising awareness of the issue of waste recycling among the youngest in our society as well as their communities.
,,,,"By recycling waste, the project aimed to help reduce plastic litter from entering nature’s playground and polluting the planet, instead creating play areas for kids to enjoy a bit of fresh air everywhere."
,,,,"The competition garnered more than 65,000 votes, including a viral video campaign from one school generating more than two million media impressions."
,,,,"The recycled playground, built at Wooler First School, was made mainly with parts made from recycled plastic lumber from curbside recycling waste collected in the UK."
,,,,"Following its success, the program is now in its second year and has been expanded in partnership with Tesco to run across the whole household category."
,,,,"Together with Gruppo Angelini in Italy, we developed technology capable of processing 10,000 tons per year of absorbent hygiene products to create new products."
,,,,"145Waste Collaborating to address Plastic Waste Circulate Capital We are proud to have been a lead partner in the creation of Circulate Capital, a new kind of investment firm that leverages technology and builds infrastructure in South and Southeast Asia to prevent plastic from becoming waste in the ocean."
,,,,"Led by Rob Kaplan, co-founder of Closed Loop Partners, the company evolved out of the “Closed Loop Ocean” project, following commitments made by us and others at the Our Ocean Conference in Malta in October 2017 to create financing opportunities focused on preventing plastic from flowing into the ocean."
,,,,"As a lead funder, we were critical to the spin-off and acceleration of the project which we see as vital to solving the ocean plastic problem."
,,,,South and Southeast Asia have seen exponential growth and development over the past 10 years that has outpaced the necessary infrastructure.
,,,,"Studies have shown that significant reduction in plastic leakage to the ocean can be achieved by improving waste management and recycling in the five countries where Circulate Capital is set to deploy: India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines."
,,,,"We believe that this unique model will be instrumental in building the infrastructure to retain plastic in packaging and product supply chains and prevent it from entering the environment, thus supporting a truly sustainable and circular economy.“P&G is proud to be part of Circulate Capital."
,,,,"Just like the Closed Loop Fund, this will address the root cause and help develop the right infrastructure to drive positive change."
,,,,"Working together, we believe we can halt the flow of plastic into the world’s oceans.” – Steve Sikra, P&G Associate Director, Corporate R&D, Global Product Stewardship Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) Demand Champions We renewed our participation as an Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) Demand Champion."
,,,,"The APR program is intended to: • Strengthen and increase domestic demand for residential mixed plastics • Make a public commitment to plastic recycling • Expand plastic recycling infrastructure • Boost a “circular economy” for plastic packaging Along with the APR and other Demand Champions, we recognize a “demand-pull” is needed to drive a positive momentum in plastic recycling."
,,,,"World Oceans Day P&G is a major sponsor of World Oceans Day, a global celebration officially recognized by the United Nations aimed at reaching millions of people worldwide to become more aware, educated and actively engaged in creating a healthier ocean and the waterways that connect to it."
,,,,"We are also a proud founding partner of Youth for the Ocean, a new collaborative initiative that will help drive youth awareness of the importance of a healthy ocean and how everyone can help, including educating youth about plastic pollution issues and solutions, driving action by mobilizing a youth constituency to prevent plastic pollution and helping clean up communities and coasts and elevating coastal and ocean health as a political priority."
,,,,Youth for the Ocean creates awareness about plastic pollution and how to keep oceans healthy.
,,,,"146Waste Waste to Worth Waste to Worth is an effort to develop an integrated, profitable and replicable waste-management business model that finds value from waste."
,,,,"Three key pilots are currently under development in Angeles City, Cabuyao and Dagupan in the Philippines."
,,,,"The goal of the pilots is to convert more than 1,000 tons per day of solid waste to value."
,,,,Various business models are being explored to extract value from waste as a means of creating economically viable and thus sustainable infrastructure.
,,,,"We have supported this effort with our partner, the Asian Development Bank, who co-funded feasibility studies that were critical to advancing the project."
,,,,"This year, the project made significant progress with signing off-take (electricity, diesel, gas) customers, permitting, engineering, investment and bidding for a construction firm to build the facilities."

,,,,The WRI/WBCSD GHG Accounting protocol provides additional perspective on market - versus location- based GHG emissions.
,,,,"Our GHG emissions data has been verified by an external third party, Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance (LRQA)."
,,,,"Low-Energy Cycle Machine Washing Loads Each year, we carefully review habits and practices data to help us assess progress against our low- energy washing goal."
,,,,"The objective of this goal is to get consumers to use low-energy cycles, and we can play a significant role in that by providing detergents that provide outstanding performance in low-energy cycles."
,,,,"We have included the following cycles in our tracking: Traditional Cold, HE Warm and Cold, with HE including both Top Loading and Front Loading HE Machines."
,,,,Our benchmark for qualifying low-energy cycles has been 0.4KWh per wash cycle.
,,,,"Based on our continuing monitoring of machine performance, we now recognize that Top Loading HE machines consume more than 0.4KWh/wash cycle but still represent a significant energy savings vs. loads run in traditional warm cycles."
,,,,"In addition, we expect total energy for these types of machines to decrease further over time based on continued innovation and regulation."
,,,,"Given our objective is to drive consumers to low-energy cycles, and since HE Top Load machines represent a significant energy savings, we will continue to count top load HE machine Warm and Cold as low-energy cycles."
,,,,"Net, there is no change in the scope of our tracking but we are modifying our approach to simply list the cycles that we now track."
,,,,For clarity they are cold cycles in traditional top load machines and cold and warm cycles in all HE machines.
,,,,"Packaging Reduction The average packaging reduction is calculated using products that represent the top 70% (by volume) of the categories that have the largest impact on packaging use (Fabric Care, Home Care, Baby Care, Feminine Care, Family Care, Oral Care, Personal Cleansing Care, Shave Prep, Hair Color and Hair Care)."
,,,,"While a subset of overall data, we believe it is representative of overall corporate data and focuses resources on the biggest SKUs and categories that have the biggest impact on packaging."
,,,,"159Global Measurement and Additional Operational Data 2020 Goal Measurement Systems Recyclability of Packaging For purposes of tracking progress against our goal, a package is considered recyclable when there is an in-market, at-scale recycling system in place for that material type (e.g., collection, sortation, processing for end use and established end-market for collected material)."
,,,,"While we require large-scale systems to be in place in at least one geography, we do not require a minimum percent access or recovery rate per package in every country or market where a package may be sold for the package to be considered recyclable for purposes of tracking progress versus our goal."
,,,,Paper Packaging Data for calculating progress versus our paper packaging goal was self-reported by our suppliers.
,,,,The data collected this year covered materials procured directly by P&G as well as contractor manufacturers and covered more than 95% of our global spend.
,,,,"Renewable Energy When calculating the renewable energy powering our plants, we include the renewable energy level of the local electrical grid that provides power to the plant.Water Conservation Our goal to reduce water use in manufacturing facilities by 20% per unit of production applies to freshwater consumption, which means freshwater intake from the following sources: • Tap water – water supplied by municipalities or third- party companies via piping systems or trucks, at any quality they deliver • Net water via purchased steam • Ground water from site wells • Surface water – non-brackish as rivers, lakes, creeks, etc., at any quality they deliver Palm Oil: We are seeking to increase our use of RSPO SG palm oil RSPO SG palm oil means that RSPO certified oil is physically segregated from non-certified oil."
,,,,"Given increasing stakeholder concerns over palm oil production practices of third-party suppliers, moving to RSPO SG oil for palm oil and derivatives provides a higher level of verification that the oil we procure is originating from RSPO-certified sources."
,,,,"It also, by definition, allows us to trace oil to the source plantation and implement additional verification efforts should they be deemed necessary."
,,,,"There are challenges with moving to RSPO SG palm oil, including both available supply and increased costs, but we are working with suppliers to try and overcome both of these challenges as we work towards our goal of having 100% of PO and POD be RSPO SG.Baseline Restatement This year, P&G adjusted our GHG emissions baseline in accordance with the principles in the WRI and WBCSD Corporate Standard for Greenhouse Gas Accounting."
,,,,Changes included adjustments for acquisitions/ divestitures as well as other minor modifications and corrections to historic data.
,,,,"Our original baseline was 5,466,601 metric tons."
,,,,"Our revised baseline, which we will use for calculating progress versus GHG emissions reduction goals, is now 5,422,275 metric tons."
,,,,"As part of this work, we also updated our baselines for energy, water and waste."
,,,,"Original energy baseline was 67,904,220 gigajoules."
,,,,"It is now 64,081,270 gigajoules."
,,,,"Original water baseline was 77,049,114 cubic meters."
,,,,"It is now 75,201,959 cubic meters."
,,,,"Original waste disposed was 354,563 metric tons."
,,,,"It is now 339,306 metric tons."
