We also saw a decrease in the absolute emissions from purchased electricity—a result of our investments in global renewable energy projects that came online in 2020—despite increasing our buildings square footage to keep pace with our business growth.,,,
"Our renewable energy investments made Amazon the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in 2020, and we achieved 65% renewable energy across our operations, up from 42% in 2019.",,,
"Like many companies and countries in high growth mode, we consider both the absolute tons of carbon in our footprint and the change in our carbon intensity.",,,
"Our carbon intensity metric quantifies total carbon emissions, in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e), per dollar of gross merchandise sales (GMS).",,,
"It is a metric commonly used to benchmark performance year over year, as it provides a relative comparison between annual metrics regardless of other changes to our business.",,,
"This metric is helpful to assess our progress toward our Climate Pledge goal of reaching net-zero carbon by 2040, even as our business grows.",,,
"While Amazon’s business grew significantly in 2020 and our absolute carbon emissions increased 19% during the same period, our overall carbon intensity decreased 16%, from 122.8 grams of CO2e per dollar of GMS in 2019 to 102.7 grams of CO2e per dollar of GMS in 2020.",,,
"This carbon intensity value is in line with the targets we are developing through the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), the industry leader in helping companies set science-based What is a carbon footprint?",,,
Our corporate carbon footprint quantifies the total greenhouse gas emissions attributed to Amazon’s direct and indirect operational activities.,,,
"We use a comprehensive, hybrid carbon footprint approach to transform physical and financial data into emissions measurements for Amazon’s specific business activities.",,,
"This allows us to calculate Amazon’s total impact on the climate, map the largest activities contributing to this impact, and develop meaningful carbon reduction strategies to reach net-zero carbon emissions across our business by 2040.Our Carbon Footprint See Amazon’s 2018-2020 carbon footprint on page 111.",,,

"Amazon joined SBTi in May 2020 and will publish our science-based targets in 2022, in accordance with SBTi’s target setting process.",,,
This year-over-year carbon intensity comparison reflects our early progress to decarbonize our operations as we also continue to grow as a company.,,,
Nearly half of our carbon intensity improvement is a result of our investments in renewable energy and operational efficiency enhancements.,,,
A third of this improvement reflects a shift in customer and employee behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic.,,,
"Customers made fewer trips to our Whole Foods Market stores and other Amazon physical stores in 2020 and shifted to home delivery instead, which generates lower carbon emissions.",,,
We also saw less business travel and employee commuting as a result of many of our employees working from home for most of the year.,,,
"We also saw a reduction in our carbon intensity at the package fulfillment level, which measures the emissions from our business activities to deliver packages to our customers’ doorsteps.",,,
"This calculation—measured in grams of CO2e per package delivered—includes the emissions generated by our fulfillment operations where items are picked off the shelf and packages are sorted, the well-to- wheel emissions across our transportation network, and the lifecycle emissions of the packaging we use to protect items during transit.",,,
"Similar to our overall carbon intensity improvement, this reduction was driven by a combination of our investments in renewable energy to power our fulfillment facilities, efficiencies in our transportation network to deliver packages, and reductions in the packaging materials we use for each package.",,,
It will take several years for the carbon reduction benefits of our investments to be fully reflected in our footprint.,,,
"While we are still in the early phase of decarbonizing our business, we are pleased to see meaningful progress in several areas.",,,
"We will continue to rapidly scale our investments in carbon reduction solutions that have large, long-term impacts that will move us forward on our path to net-zero carbon by 2040.",,,
"As these investments become embedded across our business, our carbon emissions will continue to decouple from our business growth, reflected in our carbon intensity metric.",,,
"Eventually, we will reach a point where the absolute carbon emissions of our business will drop, even as our business itself grows.",,,
This report covers the extensive investments and efforts we are making across Amazon to decarbonize our business through our Climate Pledge commitment of achieving net- zero carbon emissions by 2040.,,,

"In 2008, Amazon introduced Frustration-Free Packaging (FFP) to help manufacturers reduce packaging waste and develop sustainable alternatives for online fulfillment.",,,
Our FFP programs incentivize manufacturers to package their products in easy-to-open packaging that is 100% recyclable and ready to ship to customers without additional Amazon boxes.,,,
"To certify products under our FFP certification tiers, Amazon identifies specific steps that manufacturers can take to improve their packaging and ensure products are protected all the way to the customer’s doorstep.",,,
"We partnered with the International Safe Transit Association to craft the standards behind our FFP programs and have developed a network of structural packaging designers, testing services, and materials suppliers to support manufacturers throughout the certification process.",,,
"As of June 2021, more than 2 million products qualify under our FFP programs.",,,
Amazon also collaborates directly with top brands and selling partners to transform their packaging for FFP certification.,,,
"We teamed up with Procter & Gamble to invent the Tide Eco-Box, a concentrated version of Tide’s traditional laundry detergent compressed into a fully recyclable, shipping-safe package.",,,
"The Eco-Box is produced using 60% less plastic and 30% less water than a conventional plastic jug, and requires no additional packing materials to ship.",,,
Thousands of other brands have made similar packaging improvements by participating in Amazon’s FFP programs.,,,
Specific case studies are available on our Packaging Website.,,,
"Improving Our Packaging Materials As we continue to expand our FFP programs to reduce the need for additional packaging, we are improving the design and materials used for our packaging assortment.",,,
"We are reducing the weight of packaging materials, while making our packaging more robust to avoid damage in the e-commerce supply chain.",,,
We’ve also added on-package messaging to inform customers about these improvements and provide guidance on how to recycle their packaging materials.,,,
"One example is our innovative paper padded mailer , which offers the same recyclability as our corrugated boxes, while taking up less space in transit and in the recycling bin.",,,
"The paper padded mailer is made of four layers of paper and a water-based cushioning material, which was designed to easily separate in the same way that print inks and other paper coatings are removed during the paper recycling Packaging 36% As of June 2021, we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging by over 36% and eliminated more than 1 million tons of packaging material since 2015—the equivalent of 2 billion shipping boxes.INTRODUCTION PROGRESS ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE APPENDICES 45 Amazon Sustainability Report | 2020process.",,,

This new packaging is produced with recycled paper and eliminates the need for plastic liners or bubble bag insulation .,,,
Optimizing Through Machine Learning How big of a box is needed for a given product?,,,
Is an Amazon box needed at all?,,,
"To optimize packaging selections at Amazon’s scale, we use machine learning algorithms to arrive at the best possible packaging choices for deliveries.",,,
"That means identifying which products don’t need additional packaging, and which smaller products are suitable for flexible packaging, such as padded mailers and bags, which are up to 75% lighter than similar-sized boxes.",,,
"Flexible packaging conforms around products, reducing the need for additional packing materials, and takes up 40% less space than a box during shipping.",,,
"In cases where the protection of a box is needed, machine learning helps us continuously optimize box choices to fit our ever-changing catalog of products and redesign boxes to use less material.",,,
"When packaging weighs less and is the right size to protect customer orders, we can pack more orders into each delivery, resulting in fewer trips and less fuel burned.",,,
We also use machine learning to identify products where even small packaging improvements can have significant impacts on reducing waste.,,,
"For example, we developed a machine learning model to identify liquid products with the highest average rates of customer-reported damages.",,,
"We subject those products to extensive testing at our Amazon Packaging Lab, where we simulate a package’s journey from the manufacturer to the customer, providing data and insights we can share with manufacturers to improve their packaging design.",,,
"Packaging for Amazon Devices In 2020, we committed to make Amazon device packaging 100% curbside recyclable by 2023.",,,

"This includes using cotton sourced from recycled materials, from farms certified as producing organic cotton, or through the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), a global nonprofit that aims to transform the cotton supply chain by developing Better Cotton as a sustainable mainstream commodity.",,,
"After joining BCI in 2019, we sourced 48% of the cotton used for our Amazon-owned Private Brands apparel products as Better Cotton in 2020.",,,
"While Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products, BCI farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we source.",,,
Amazon is also a member of BCI’s Retailer and Brand Advisory Panel on Traceability.,,,
"In 2019, Amazon signed the Responsible Sourcing Network’s public Cotton Pledges, committing to not source cotton from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan for Amazon-owned Private Brands products until the pervasive use of government- mandated forced labor is stopped.",,,
"In 2021, we began participating in a Responsible Sourcing Network initiative called YESS: Yarn Ethically & Sustainably Sourced, which works to address forced labor in the cotton value chain.",,,
"Cellulosic Fibers By 2022, we will ensure that none of the manmade cellulosic fibers (including rayon, viscose, lyocell, and modal) sourced for Amazon-owned Private Brands apparel products are derived from ancient or endangered forests, INTRODUCTION PROGRESS ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE APPENDICES 55 Amazon Sustainability Report | 2020endangered species’ habitats, or other controversial sources, as defined by the nonprofit organization Canopy’s tools and reports.",,,
"Our approach to cellulosics includes using fabrics that provide assurance on traceability and use best-available processing technology, as well as supporting the use of innovative lower-impact alternative fiber sources, such as recycled fiber from used clothing.",,,
"Recycled Fabrics We will increase the use of recycled fabrics in Amazon- owned Private Brands apparel products, including moving from conventional to recycled polyester, and launching products made from innovative recycled fibers.",,,
"In 2020, we joined the Textile Exchange, a global nonprofit that works with its members to drive industry transformation in preferred fibers, including recycled materials.",,,

"Our strategy to deliver on these commitments to human rights has four pillars: developing strong policies, embedding human rights into our business, addressing risk through mechanisms, and transparency and stakeholder engagement.",,,
"Strong Policies Our efforts are anchored in policies that apply across all aspects of our business—from our own operations, to our supply chain, to the communities in which we operate.",,,
"In a commitment to continuously raising the bar, in 2019, we codified our long-standing commitment to human rights in the form of Amazon’s Global Human Rights Principles, which reflect the foundation of how we embed respect for human rights throughout our business.",,,
We are committed to consistently evolving and improving our approach.,,,
We regularly review our policies to identify areas for update and improvement.,,,
We conduct in- depth benchmarking against international standards and evolving industry norms at least every three years in line with industry best practices.,,,
"Human Rights Principles From the employees in our fulfillment centers, to the drivers delivering packages to our customers, to the workers in factories making the products we sell—people enable our mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company.",,,
These values have been long-held at Amazon and codifying them into a set of Human Rights Principles demonstrates our support for fundamental human rights and the dignity of workers everywhere we operate around the world.,,,
Supply Chain Standards We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers.,,,
"Our Supply Chain Standards detail the requirements and expectations for our suppliers, their supply chains, and selling partners who list products in our stores, and they are grounded in principles of inclusivity, continuous improvement, and supply chain accountability.",,,
We engage with suppliers that are committed to these same principles; suppliers are subject to these standards as a condition of doing business with us.,,,

"We have detailed the components of this commitment to combating human trafficking (also referred to as modern slavery) in our annual Modern Slavery Statement, our Supply Chain Standards, and our Global Human Rights Principles.",,,
We’re raising awareness through employee training and partnerships.,,,
Our human trafficking awareness program provides ongoing training to employees around the world to recognize indicators of human trafficking and report concerns to appropriate authorities in a way that puts the interests of victims first.,,,
"To develop the training, we incorporated videos and materials from the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), a UK public agency focused on investigating labor exploitation.",,,
"Our global security operations team has immediate response protocols in the event of a suspected human trafficking-related issue, regardless of where the issue arises.",,,
"We are also an official corporate sponsor of Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT), an organization dedicated to combating human trafficking in the trucking industry, and began using TAT training modules to train our internal fleet of drivers, teaching them how to identify and respond to potential victims of human trafficking.",,,
"As of January 2021, we trained 100% of Amazon employees who are behind the wheels of trucks in our middle-mile business.Embedding Human Rights Into Our Business We are committed to embedding human rights considerations into decision-making across the company and into our policy and governance framework.",,,

"In 2020, we enhanced our training on human trafficking and forced labor for employees in our logistics network.",,,
"Mechanisms to Address Risk We are committed to identifying, preventing, and mitigating adverse human rights impacts, and are continuously working to improve our approach.",,,
"At Amazon, every business deploys a variety of mechanisms to help us inspect our business and make decisions at various points of product and process development and in the execution of our day- to-day operations.",,,
Social Responsibility teams review the performance and impact of our own programs and inspect activity in our global supply chains.,,,
"In our supply chain, we assess and respond to risk by leveraging internal and external data and guidance from external stakeholders, including industry experts, civil society groups, and non-governmental organizations.",,,
One way we do this is through independent audits to verify compliance with our Supply Chain Standards though regular on-site inspections and confidential worker interviews.,,,
Learn more about our Responsible Sourcing Program on page 84.,,,
We recognize that audits alone are insufficient to drive long-term change across industries.,,,
"We, like many companies in similar industries, are exploring new ways to encourage improvement in worker protections, including supplier capacity building programs, worker trainings, and collaborations with other brands and civil society.",,,

Amazon’s Salient Human Rights Issues The guidance provided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights recommends that companies identify their most salient human rights risks as the first step in a comprehensive human rights due diligence strategy.,,,
"Since 2020, we have worked with sustainability and human rights consulting firm Article One Advisors to identify salient human rights risks across our business.",,,
"In conducting this assessment, we consulted a diverse group of external human rights experts and incorporated their feedback into the results.",,,
We benchmarked the results against internationally recognized human rights standards.,,,
This assessment identified a set of priority human rights values and key salient human rights risks for Amazon.,,,
"Our existing policies and programs currently address many of these risks, however, we will use the assessment results to build on current practice and prioritize our human rights due diligence efforts.",,,
One important due diligence tool is a human rights impact assessment (HRIA).,,,
"HRIAs are an effective mechanism to identify and address adverse impacts business activities might have on individuals such as workers, local community members, or consumers.",,,
The process involves meaningful engagement with external stakeholders to gain a full understanding of potential impacts.,,,
"Human Rights Values Respect Human Rights in our Supply Chain Empower Employees and Contractors Earn and Keep the Trust of Our Customers Strengthen the Communities We ServeDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion Safe and Healthy Working Conditions Modern Slavery and Forced Labor Fair Wages and Hours Freedom of Association Future of Work Right to Privacy Product Safety and Security Social, Economic, and Environmental Justice Three Foundational Commitments Meaningful Consultation with Stakeholders Opportunity for Concerns to be Heard and Issues Resolved Focus on Vulnerable GroupsLearn more about our efforts on diversity, equity, and inclusion on page 71.",,,
"INTRODUCTION PROGRESS ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE APPENDICES 61 Amazon Sustainability Report | 2020In 2020, we conducted our first HRIA to assess the raw and recovered materials supply chain for Amazon-branded digital devices (Kindle, Fire TV, Fire Tablet, Ring, and Echo), including the manufacture, assembly, and return of those products.",,,
"The raw and recovered materials supply chain is a complex system of sellers, buyers, traders, producers, processors, and manufacturers across multiple tiers and sourcing regions around the world.",,,
"This supply chain is, in many places, highly opaque, adding to the challenge of identifying and prioritizing salient human rights risks and impacts.",,,
"For this assessment, we focused on four supply chain categories: Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing, reverse logistics, minerals and metals, and plastics and synthetics.",,,
"We engaged an independent third-party expert, Article One, to research key human rights risks across these categories, conduct a gap analysis of Amazon’s current approach to managing human rights risks, and identify opportunities to have a positive impact.",,,
"The process included internal interviews, reviews of media and third-party reporting, and external stakeholder engagement.",,,
"We selected external stakeholders based on their representation of impacted groups, geographic scope, and expertise in human rights.",,,
"They included experts on a wide array of issues, including human rights and sustainable development in technology, finance, waste, plastics, responsible minerals, circular economy, and science-based solutions.",,,
"Key Learnings and Opportunities Using the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as a framework to guide the assessment, the HRIA conducted this past year resulted in the following findings and areas of opportunity for the supply chains of Amazon- branded digital devices, which was the focus of this HRIA.",,,
These findings and areas of opportunity could also be applied across Amazon: Tier 1 and 2 Manufacturing: These are the facilities and suppliers involved in the final assembly of Amazon devices (Tier 1) and component manufacturing (Tier 2).,,,
The assessment found that Amazon suppliers in this category had moderate to high levels of awareness of Amazon’s social compliance requirements.,,,
"However, challenges remain throughout the electronics industry as a whole, including: difficulties enforcing working hour and rest requirements; low or unequal wages, even when compliant with national minimum wages standards; and absence of effective grievance mechanisms for workers.",,,

The assessment found risks in this sector were similar to those identified for Tier 1 and 2 Manufacturing.,,,
"Minerals and Metals: Amazon conducts robust due diligence on our suppliers annually to ensure the absence of conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) in our supply chain.",,,
"Human rights issues are also associated with other minerals, metals, and rare earth supply chains.",,,
Read more about our approach to conflict minerals on page 89.,,,
Plastics and Synthetics: The electronics industry as a whole has limited visibility over the sourcing locations of the plastics and synthetics supply chain or the chemicals used in plastic production.,,,
"These commodities are sold to countless purchasers across multiple tiers of production, making traceability extremely difficult.",,,
Building on Our Efforts This HRIA was a key milestone in our human rights strategy and deepened our understanding of salient human rights risks in the Amazon devices supply chain and the electronics industry as a whole.,,,
"We will incorporate the results of this assessment into our overall business approach, continuing to improve our reporting and transparency and build on our progress.",,,
The assessment results pointed to several areas of opportunity.,,,
These include increased access to effective grievance mechanisms and remedy through strategic partnerships.,,,
We will further our efforts to incorporate social responsibility performance evaluation tools into our assessment of reverse logistics suppliers and work with our suppliers to increase their use of recycled or renewable materials in place of virgin materials.,,,
We are also scoping expansion of our human rights due diligence beyond conflict minerals to other minerals with human rights risk.,,,
Another critical opportunity includes deepening our engagement with external stakeholders to improve management of our salient human rights risks and identify opportunities for long-term partnerships to address systemic issues.,,,
"As we implement the HRIA results based on priority, we will continue to identify opportunities to promote human rights across the Amazon devices supply chain.",,,
INTRODUCTION PROGRESS ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE GOVERNANCE APPENDICES 63 Amazon Sustainability Report | 2020Transparency and Stakeholder Engagement We are committed to driving industry-wide best practices in human rights due diligence through increased disclosures about our approach and by expanding our stakeholder engagement.,,,

"Supporting Workers, Suppliers, and Communities During COVID-19 Amazon is committed to supporting our suppliers, their workers, and their communities as they are impacted by COVID-19.",,,
"Of course, the global COVID-19 pandemic made 2020 a particularly challenging year, as suppliers faced massive supply chain disruption, workers were displaced, and communities experienced unimaginable loss.",,,
We immediately went to work to address these challenges.,,,
We adapted our due diligence.,,,
"In 2020, we had to change how we assessed suppliers.",,,
"With COVID-19 restrictions, it was much harder to conduct on-site assessments.",,,
"We continued to utilize traditional audits when it was safe to do so, but when on-site audits became challenging or impossible due to safety restrictions, we adopted new mechanisms to assess risk, including self- assessment questionnaires and remote document review.",,,
We engaged suppliers.,,,
We developed guidance and trainings for suppliers on how to support and protect workers during the pandemic.,,,
We educated managers on workplace hygiene and proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of COVID-19.,,,
"We also encouraged suppliers to continue pay for workers during shutdowns, recognizing the extraordinary toll layoffs are taking on the workforce.",,,
We invested in workers.,,,
"In 2020, we created a $1.3 million fund to invest in organizations providing critical frontline support to workers impacted by COVID-19.",,,
"For example, we provided support to organizations like the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Bangladesh to distribute medical supplies and COVID- 19-related resources for frontline doctors, nurses, and medical workers operating in the largest refugee camp in the world.",,,
"The contribution supported the procurement of lifesaving PPE—approximately 322,000 gloves, 16,000 gowns and coveralls, 18,300 N95 respirators, and 119,000 face shields—for 23 IOM-managed health facilities, serving to benefit both refugee and host community populations in the region.",,,
We listened to workers.,,,
"We increased our investment in Amader Kotha, meaning ‘Our Voice’ in Bengali, a helpline that provides workers in the Bangladesh ready-made garment sector a safe and effective way to report and resolve workplace issues.",,,
"In 2020, we enrolled 23 Amazon suppliers in Amader Kotha’s program.",,,
"For every worker call, the helpline follows a defined protocol to address the reported issue until it is resolved with their employer.",,,
"For example, in December 2020, Amader Kotha received a call from a worker employed with one of our Bangladesh suppliers.",,,
The worker reported verbal and physical abuse and retaliatory firing when they refused to complete overtime after regular work hours.,,,
Amader Kotha immediately connected with the supplier’s compliance team to investigate the issue.,,,

,,Supply Chain Standards We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers.,
,,"Our Supply Chain Standards detail the requirements and expectations for suppliers, vendors, and service providers throughout our supply chain, and suppliers must commit to these standards as a condition of doing business with us.",
,,Supplier Manual Our Supplier Manual provides guidance and resources to suppliers of Amazon-branded products on how to meet and exceed the expectations outlined in our Supply Chain Standards.Our approach is based on a commitment to workers and to continuous improvement; we put the safety and interests of workers first.,
,,Suppliers are required to meaningfully participate in any investigation and take immediate action in the event that issues are found.,

,,We recognize that some issues may take time to effectively remediate.,
,,"For Medium level issues, we expect suppliers to show they are making meaningful progress toward remediation within a defined timeline.",
,,"For Low level issues, we monitor suppliers for continuous improvement.",
,,We have dedicated teams based in key sourcing countries around the globe that work directly with our suppliers to identify solutions to challenging problems and promote open dialogue.,
,,We seek to create long-term relation- ships with suppliers who align with our values and who are committed to constantly improving conditions for workers.,
,,"Where we see trends in issues beyond individual suppliers, such as widespread health and safety deficits or industry-wide failures to responsibly protect migrant workers, we work to define regional or global strategies to address underlying systemic challenges.",
,,The most common High and Medium level finding in 2019 was the Wages and Benefits subcategory.,
,,"Examples of findings in this subcategory are: failure to pay overtime at the appropriate overtime rate, wage payments were delayed, or required government deductions have not been properly paid.",

,,,"11Shipment Zero In 2019, Amazon announced Shipment Zero, an initiative to make every Amazon shipment net zero carbon, with half of all shipments achieving net zero carbon by 2030."
,,,"Shipment Zero means that the fulfillment operations we undertake to deliver a customer shipment are net zero carbon—from the fulfillment center where an item is picked off the shelf, to the materials used to package the item, and the vehicles that transport the package to the customer’s door."
,,,"The first Shipment Zero deliveries will begin shipping to customers before the end of 2019 in both Europe and the U.S. before expanding to India, Japan, and other geographies in 2020 and beyond."
,,,Fulfillment Centers Every Shipment Zero delivery begins its journey at fulfillment and sort centers powered by 100% renewable energy.
,,,"More than 50 Amazon facilities around the world are powered by solar roofs, which can generate as much as 80% of a single fulfillment facility’s annual energy needs."
,,,"To reach 100% renewable energy, we invest in large-scale wind and solar projects that distribute energy onto the grid for our use."
,,,Sustainable Operations 12Packaging A Shipment Zero order will be shipped in its own container or in carbon neutral packaging.
,,,"We continue to raise the bar for sustainable packaging—from optimizing the size and weight of shipping materials, inventing new recyclable mailers, and working with suppliers to streamline and innovate product packaging."
,,,"Transportation A Shipment Zero package will be transported in a zero-emissions delivery vehicle—for example, one of our 100,000 newly ordered electric delivery vehicles, an electric bike, or an electric rickshaw in India."
,,,We also leverage innovative technology to maximize efficiency on the road and reduce delivery times by placing delivery stations close to large Amazon customer populations.
,,,13Sustainable Transportation Transportation is a key component of our vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon as part of Shipment Zero.
,,,We are committed to optimizing and transforming this critical part of our carbon footprint using several strategies.
,,,"Electrifying our Future Transport Fleets Amazon operates hundreds of electric vehicles across the globe and has invested $440 million in Rivian to accelerate the production of electric vehicles, which are critical to reducing emissions from transportation."
,,,"As part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, Amazon recently ordered 100,000 new electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles."
,,,"Amazon plans to start using these new electric vehicles to deliver packages to customers by 2021, with 10,000 new vehicles on the road as early as 2021 and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030, saving 4 million metric tons of carbon per year by 2030."
,,,"Maximizing Efficiency on Current Vehicles While we are working hard to adopt the most efficient, cutting-edge vehicle technologies, we are also maximizing efficiencies on our existing fleets."
,,,"In North America, our fleet includes a mix of trailers in different sizes that are equipped with skirts (panels attached to the lower side edges of a trailer to make it more aerodynamic) and automatic tire inflation systems that keep tires properly inflated and maximize fuel efficiency."
,,,"We use mud flaps specially designed to allow airflow and water to pass through them, minimizing drag and saving an average of 100 gallons of diesel fuel per vehicle annually."
,,,"In Europe, we have deployed double-deck trailers, which increase the load capacity per trailer, reducing the total number of trailers on the road."
,,,Optimizing our Delivery Logistics Amazon is constantly working to optimize our delivery network and drive efficiencies in the process of delivering our products.
,,,"To fulfill customer orders quickly, we have thousands of vehicles moving from fulfillment centers to delivery destinations."
,,,We use data and algorithms to consolidate as many 14Sustainable Operationsshipments as possible onto one vehicle or plane.
,,,"We also analyze which items are being ordered most frequently, by location, to ensure that the inventory of those items is stored nearby, minimizing the need to use planes or trucks for long-distance deliveries."
,,,"By boosting efficiencies across our network, we can avert the need to put more vehicles and planes into service."
,,,Using Alternative Delivery Methods We are continually piloting new or alternative ideas in different locations around the world in an effort to increase our efficiency and reduce emissions.
,,,"In urban centers like New York City, we deliver packages on foot, have expanded our use of traditional bicycles, and use pedal-assist electric bikes connected to cargo trailers that can carry up to 45 packages."
,,,"In India, our fleet includes electric three-wheelers, or rickshaws, and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles."
,,,Electric bikes and CNG vehicles are also part of our delivery fleet in Europe.
,,,"Finally, we’re developing electric autonomous delivery services, such as the Amazon Scout device and Prime Air drones."
,,,"Partnering with Experts and Industry In 2017, Amazon signed the Sustainable Fuel Buyers’ Principles, demonstrating our commitment to working with service providers to accelerate the transition to low-carbon commercial transportation solutions."
,,,Members of the nonprofit Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) Future of Fuels group developed The Buyers’ Principles and vetted them through its network of 600 expert and industry stakeholders.
,,,These principles outline criteria that will catalyze the partnerships needed to drive the transition to a sustainable road freight transportation system.
,,,"Buildings Sustainable Fulfillment Centers As one of the most important stops on a product’s journey to a customer’s door, Amazon’s fulfillment centers play a key role in achieving our Shipment Zero goal."

,,,"We work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging options using a science-based approach that includes lab testing, machine learning, materials science, and manufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change across the packaging supply chain."
,,,Sustainable Packaging Initiatives Our sustainable packaging initiatives reduce waste and make it easier for customers to take products out of their packages.
,,,"Since 2008, initiatives including Frustration-Free Packaging (FFP) have eliminated more than 665,000 tons of packaging materials—more than 1.18 billion shipping boxes—by promoting easy-to-open, recyclable packaging and shipping products in their own packages without additional shipping boxes."
,,,"To certify products under FFP, we work with manufacturers worldwide, helping them innovate and improve their packaging functionality."
,,,"By testing products in a dedicated, state-of-the-art lab in Seattle and in our fulfillment centers across the globe, we identify specific steps that manufacturers can take to improve their packaging and ensure customers’ products are protected all the way to their final destination."
,,,"We started small with just 19 products enclosed in hard plastic cases known as “clamshells” and secured with plastic-coated wire ties, which are commonly used in consumer goods packaging."
,,,"Today, more than 1.3 million products qualify under FFP, including the Philips Norelco OneBlade razor, which now takes up 80% less packaging volume than its original design."
,,,Using Machine Learning to Optimize Packages How big of a box is needed for a given product?
,,,Is an Amazon box needed at all?
,,,"To better understand the answers to those questions, we use machine learning algorithms to arrive at the best possible packaging choices for Since 2008, initiatives including Frustration-Free Packaging have eliminated more than 665,000 tons of packaging materials—more than 1.18 billion shipping boxes."
,,,24 Packaging and Productsdeliveries.
,,,That means identifying which products are suitable for envelopes and moving from a box to a mailer for smaller items.
,,,"Mailers use less material than their box equivalent, weigh less, and are more efficient to ship, reducing carbon in small amounts to create larger impact across our network."
,,,"In cases where the protection of a box is needed, algorithms help us continuously optimize box choices to fit our ever-changing catalog."
,,,Computer-aided engineering is also helping us redesign boxes to use less material while making sure customer orders are protected.
,,,"These improvements help reduce volume per shipment, which means less unnecessary packaging and more efficient use of all forms of transportation."
,,,"Recyclable Mailers In 2018, we launched a fully recyclable paper padded mailer made of four layers of paper and a water-based cushioning material that protects products during shipping, ensuring customer deliveries arrive undamaged and in sustainable packaging."
,,,The cushioning material—created with components commonly found in the glue used to make cardboard—was specifically designed to easily separate from the paper in the same way that print inks and other paper coatings are removed during the paper recycling process.
,,,"Engaging with Vendors and Industry We work with top brands to reinvent their packaging for waste reduction in e-commerce, and vendors have worked to improve product packaging so products can be shipped in their own container."
,,,"The toy maker Hasbro, for example, redesigned the packaging for its popular toy, Baby Alive, reducing both the amount of material used and the overall package size by more than half."
,,,The pet food company Hill’s Pet Nutrition reworked its packaging to make bags of kibble less likely to break and spill during shipment; testing at Amazon validated the redesigned packaging.
,,,"We are working across the packaging industry, using new analytics and test methods, new materials, and new ways to build enclosures that protect customer products."
,,,"With packaging suppliers, for example, we have developed solutions for liquid dispensing systems on hard-to-ship items, such as household cleaners and personal care products, preventing spills and the need for extra packaging to contain spills if they happen."
,,,"Amazon is a member of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition (SPC), an industry working group dedicated to a more robust environmental vision Judge a toy by its box amzn.to/toy-box 25for packaging."
,,,"SPC uses strong member support, an informed and science- based approach, supply chain collaborations, and continuous outreach to design packaging that encourages a sustainable flow of materials."
,,,"Amazon has also joined the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA), an organization focused on the specific concerns of transport packaging."
,,,"ISTA is a nonprofit, member-driven association that sets the standards for optimizing the resources in packages that are designed to be survivable, sustainable, and successful."
,,,"Innovating to Reduce Spills in Transit In an effort to reduce waste at every step of our supply chain, we are constantly exploring ways to minimize damage to products during the transportation and delivery process."
,,,"When products spill or break during transit, it not only creates product and packaging waste, but requires additional shipping and processing efforts, all of which contribute to our carbon footprint."
,,,We are working directly with manufacturers and suppliers to make packaging more durable for the journey between a manufacturer’s facility and a customer’s home without the need for excessive protective packaging that ends up in the waste stream.
,,,"To help target products where even small packaging improvements can have significant impacts on reducing waste, we developed a machine learning model to identify liquid products with the highest average rates of customer reported damages."
,,,"We then subjected 14 of the most commonly damaged liquid products to extensive additional testing at our Amazon Packaging Lab, where we simulate a package’s journey from the manufacturer to the customer."
,,,"Through this process, we teamed up with Rieke—a packaging solutions firm that makes dispensing systems for personal care, food, and healthcare products—to provide data and packaging insights on many of the conventional dispensing systems that are used in millions of products you see on Amazon."
,,,"By strengthening materials, creating new locking mechanisms to prevent pumps from twisting open, and sealing potential leak points, Rieke’s team has created dispensers specially designed to withstand the journey 26 Packaging and Productsto the customer."
,,,"These new and improved designs include trigger sprayers common on household cleaners and personal care products, pumps for lotions, and pumps for foams."
,,,"Rieke’s new trigger sprayer design, for example, reduces the number of packaging components from five to one and cuts package volume by nearly 50%, earning Amazon’s Frustration-Free Packaging certification."
,,,"Product manufacturers like Unilever are adopting these dispensers, and you can find the redesigned lotion pumps on body washes from Caress and Dove."
,,,"Rieke is also developing entirely new forms of packaging for liquid products sold on Amazon, such as sprayer and foaming caps that are activated by squeezing instead of hand triggers or pumps."
,,,"Some of these changes might seem simple, and most will go unnoticed by customers."
,,,"But whether the adjustments are straightforward tweaks or complex feats of engineering, they all represent significant changes to how products are shipped, delighting customers and reducing packaging waste."
,,,These innovations are just one part of Amazon’s efforts to reduce waste in packaging and achieve net zero carbon shipments through our Shipment Zero goal.
,,,"Sustainable Products from Amazon Amazon strives to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, which means giving our customers access to the sustainable products they want."
,,,We regularly seek ways to reduce our environmental impact and provide more information about the products we sell.
,,,"When we call a product sustainable, that means it has a lower impact on the environment, reduces waste, promotes consumer health, protects animal welfare, or has social benefits over conventional versions of the same products."
,,,We work with many of the manufacturers that produce our private- label selection to grow these types of product offerings.
,,,"We focus on every step of the process: the ingredients and materials, how the people behind the products are treated, the packaging, and the experience for customers."
,,,"Rieke’s new trigger sprayer design, for example, reduces the number of packaging components from five to one and cuts package volume by nearly 50%."
,,,27Household Goods Many Amazon customers prioritize safety and sustainability when it comes to household goods like cleaning supplies and personal care products.

,,,More than two-thirds of this advantage is attributable to the combination of a more energy efficient server population and much higher server utilization.
,,,AWS data centers are also more energy efficient than enterprise sites due to comprehensive efficiency programs that touch every facet of the facility.

,,,59Water Reducing Water Used for Cooling in AWS Data Centers AWS has always focused on efficiency and continuous innovation in our data centers to improve operational excellence and reduce our impact on the environment.
,,,"In addition to our efforts on energy efficiency and our goal to achieve 100% renewable energy for our global infrastructure, AWS has multiple initiatives to improve our water use efficiency and reduce the use of potable (drinking) water for cooling data centers."
,,,"AWS develops our water use strategy by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region, local water management and availability, and the opportunity to conserve drinking water sources."
,,,"Taking a holistic approach, we assess both the water and energy usage of each potential cooling solution to select the most efficient method."
,,,"Evaporative Cooling When possible, AWS incorporates direct evaporative technology for cooling our data centers, significantly reducing energy and water consumption."
,,,"During cooler months, outside air is directly supplied to the data center without using any water."
,,,"During the hottest months of the year, outside air is cooled through an evaporative process using water before being pushed into the server rooms, and we have optimized our cooling systems to use minimal water."
,,,"AWS is constantly innovating the design of our cooling systems to further reduce water use, and we utilize real-time sensor data to adapt to changing weather conditions."
,,,Recycled Water AWS is expanding its use of non-potable water for cooling purposes to help conserve local drinking water sources.
,,,"In Northern Virginia, AWS was the first data center operator to be approved to use recycled water with direct evaporative cooling technology."
,,,"We partnered with Loudoun Water to demonstrate the benefits of recycled water for industrial cooling applications, and shared our operational best practices for utilizing recycled water in our data centers."
,,,"In the AWS U.S. West (Oregon) Region, we have partnered with a local utility to use non-potable water for multiple data centers, and we are retrofitting AWS data centers in Northern California to use recycled water."
,,,60 Sustainability in the CloudThe process for utilizing recycled water begins when wastewater from residential and industrial customers is treated at a local facility and redistributed through its own piping infrastructure.
,,,Recycled water has to meet stringent health standards and safe surface discharge standards.
,,,"AWS is working with local utilities to expand distribution infrastructure and drive faster implementation and adoption of recycled water for data center cooling applications, in order to reduce our usage of potable water."
,,,Onsite Water Treatment AWS is implementing onsite modular water treatment systems in multiple regions.
,,,"As water is cycled through evaporative cooling units, minerals build up as water evaporates, eventually reaching a level of concentration that requires replacement with fresh water."
,,,Onsite water treatment allows us to remove scale-forming minerals and reuse water for more cycles.
,,,Increasing our “cycles of concentration” allows us to continue to reduce water intake for cooling our data centers.
,,,"Water Efficiency Metrics In the infrastructure regions where we use water for cooling, AWS has developed water efficiency metrics to determine and monitor optimal water use for each AWS Region, and we employ a data-driven approach to select the most effective water reduction technologies."
,,,"Water metrics from each of our Regions help AWS evaluate technologies and understand the long- term impacts on our water usage, in order to increase efficiency as our infrastructure grows and we expand to new regions."
,,,"We are partnering with utilities to connect directly to utility water meters, and we are also installing our own meters to track real-time water usage to provide consistent data for our operations and sustainability teams."
,,,"By analyzing this data, AWS can identify opportunities to reduce water usage and rapidly make operational changes, rather than waiting for bills or usage reports."
,,,AWS will continue to implement these strategies and test new technologies in order to reduce our water consumption and conserve potable water sources.
,,,Saving water is good for the environment and also benefits our customers as we increase our operational efficiency.
