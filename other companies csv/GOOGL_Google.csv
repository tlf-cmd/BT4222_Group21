This report covers the global operations of Google and all its subsidiaries.,,,,,,,,
Google LLC itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.,,,,,,,,
"In 2021, Google Sweden AB—a Swedish limited liability company—is the only entity required to report under Directive 2014/95/EU, according to the Swedish Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) (Sw.Årsredovisningslagen).",,,,,,,,
"This report includes summary information on Google’s environmental initiatives, employee matters, social impact, respect of human rights, and anti-corruption and bribery matters.",,,,,,,,
"When available, such as for diversity and inclusion data, data covers our 2020 fiscal year (January 1 to December 31, 2020).",,,,,,,,
"When 2020 data is not yet available, such as for most of our environmental data, data covers our 2019 fiscal year (January 1 to December 31, 2019).",,,,,,,,
"For more detailed information on any of these topics, see Google’s Commitments page, which highlights our work across five areas: Protecting users, Expanding opportunity, Including all voices, Responding to crises, and Advancing sustainability.",,,,,,,,
Our Reports database contains our public reports pertaining to each of these five areas.,,,,,,,,
Additional information about our commitment to corporate responsibility can be found on Alphabet’s Investor Relations page.,,,,,,,,
Google European Union NFRD Report 2021 1Google’s business model Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.,,,,,,,,
Alphabet is a collection of businesses—the largest of which is Google—which we report as two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.,,,,,,,,
Our Google Services and Google Cloud segments together represented approximately 99% of our consolidated revenues in 2020.,,,,,,,,
Our Google Services segment generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising.,,,,,,,,
"We continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that will grow revenues beyond advertising, including Google Play, hardware, and YouTube non-advertising services.",,,,,,,,
Our Google Cloud segment generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace collaboration tools.,,,,,,,,
"For more information on Google’s business model, see Alphabet’s 2020 Annual Report.",,,,,,,,
"Environmental initiatives Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time, and we’ve long been committed to improving our energy consumption.",,,,,,,,
Operating Google’s business in an environmentally sustainable way has been a core value since our founding.,,,,,,,,
We’re focused on tackling our energy consumption through a threefold strategy for carbon neutrality.,,,,,,,,
"First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energy efficiency initiatives.",,,,,,,,
"Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy; we’re the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world.",,,,,,,,
"Third, we buy high-quality carbon offsets for any remaining emissions we haven’t yet eliminated.",,,,,,,,
"Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, and in 2020, we purchased enough renewable energy to match 100% of the electricity we consumed for our global operations for the fourth consecutive year.",,,,,,,,
"From 2010 to 2019, Google has signed more than 50 power purchase agreements totaling more than 5 gigawatts of renewable energy that is new to the grid, representing a commitment of approximately $4 billion through 2034.",,,,,,,,
These deals have resulted in over $7 billion in investments in renewable energy projects across the globe.,,,,,,,,
We have agreements in place to purchase energy from four continents.,,,,,,,,
"In 2020, building on what we’d learned and due to the transformation underway in the global energy system, we set a new goal: By 2030 we aim to run our business on carbon-free energy everywhere, at all times.",,,,,,,,
This means that we will evolve from matching our annual energy consumption with renewable energy to sourcing round-the-clock carbon-free energy.,,,,,,,,
"2 Google European Union NFRD Report 20212Google’s data centers are the heart of our company, powering products like Search, Gmail, and YouTube for billions of people around the world, 24/7.",,,,,,,,
"For more than a decade, we’ve worked to make Google data centers more efficient and have striven to improve their environmental performance even as demand for our products has dramatically risen.",,,,,,,,
"On average, a Google data center is twice as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center.",,,,,,,,
"In 2020, the average annual PUE (power usage effectiveness) for our global fleet of data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.59— meaning that Google data centers use about six times less overhead energy for every unit of IT equipment energy.",,,,,,,,
"At Google, just as we focus on users in designing our products, we focus on our employees in creating healthy workplaces, from our San Francisco Bay Area headquarters to Google offices at diverse sites in more than 170 cities around the world.",,,,,,,,
"At the end of 2019, over 1.4 million square meters (15 million square feet) of Google office facilities had achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification.",,,,,,,,
We also put Google technology to work helping others study and respond to environmental challenges.,,,,,,,,
"We’re working with numerous research and nonprofit organizations to map the world’s forests, oceans, watersheds, and air quality, then helping to get that information into the hands of decision- makers.",,,,,,,,
"We do this by working with partners to build tools like Global Forest Watch, Global Fishing Watch, Project Sunroof, Project Air View, Global Surface Water Explorer, Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer, and the DiSARM platform for malaria risk mapping.",,,,,,,,
"Through Google.org, we’ve funded numerous initiatives and organizations to support climate action, access to clean energy, and conservation.",,,,,,,,
"For example, in 2020, we launched the Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate, which commits €10 million to fund bold ideas that aim to use technology to accelerate Europe’s progress toward a greener, more resilient future.",,,,,,,,
"The highest level of direct responsibility for climate change rests with the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet and Google, who is responsible for overseeing climate-related issues as she has visibility across all of the company's operations.",,,,,,,,
"The Audit and Compliance Committee of Alphabet’s Board of Directors oversees and monitors Alphabet’s major risk exposures, including financial, operational, data privacy and security, competition, legal, regulatory, compliance, civil and human rights, sustainability, and reputational risks, and the steps Alphabet takes to prevent, detect, monitor, and actively manage such exposures.",,,,,,,,
"Primary responsibility for managing climate-related issues is delegated to our Google Sustainability Officer, who leads sustainability across Google’s worldwide operations, products and supply chain and ensures alignment of our climate strategy across different business units.",,,,,,,,
"3 Google European Union NFRD Report 20213For more information about our environmental sustainability initiatives, risk assessments, and key performance indicators, see our 2020 Environmental Report and our 2020 CDP Climate Change Response.",,,,,,,,
"Alphabet has earned a position on CDP’s Climate Change A List, which recognizes leadership on climate action and transparency, for seven consecutive years.",,,,,,,,
Employee matters We recognize that our employees are our best assets and critical to our continued success.,,,,,,,,
"We invest heavily in hiring talented individuals, and we seek to hire people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives.",,,,,,,,
Google’s Code of Conduct provides a guide as to how our employees are expected to put Google’s values into practice as they pursue the company’s mission.,,,,,,,,
This includes respect for one another and for our users.,,,,,,,,
"Employees are expected to create and preserve a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias, and unlawful discrimination.",,,,,,,,
"Code of Conduct training is provided to all Google employees at all levels of the organization, and we offer unconscious bias training.",,,,,,,,
"In an effort to accelerate our commitments to be a representative, equitable, and respectful workplace, we are increasing transparency around Googlers’ concerns and how we handle them, as well as increasing support for people who raise concerns.",,,,,,,,
"In 2019, we updated our Internal Investigations Report to include a section that provides detail about internal sexual harassment investigations as well as expanded sexual harassment scenarios that reflect examples of the types of conduct that may result in termination of employment.",,,,,,,,
"In 2019, we also publicly shared our Policy on Harassment, Discrimination, Retaliation, Standards of Conduct, and Workplace Concerns, as well as our processes and channels for raising and investigating concerns.",,,,,,,,
"In 2020, we announced new workplace commitments that continue to build on our efforts to handle concerns with care and foster respect in the workplace.",,,,,,,,
"This reflects the Alphabet Board’s agreement on a series of industry-leading principles and improvements that incorporated input from both employees and stockholders, including the creation of a new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Advisory Council, which comprises internal senior executives and external DEI experts.",,,,,,,,
The Board also will review the effectiveness of our sexual harassment and retaliation prevention programs and proposed changes.,,,,,,,,
"Building diversity, equity, and inclusion into our workplace, products, and programs is at the heart of creating a more helpful Google for everyone.",,,,,,,,
"When we get this right, we ensure that everyone feels like they belong at Google and beyond.",,,,,,,,
"We believe the greatest contribution we can make is sustained action within our company, our communities, and the world.",,,,,,,,
"4 Google European Union NFRD Report 2021We continue to focus on developing, progressing, and retaining women and employees from underrepresented communities at all stages of their careers.",,,,,,,,
"For example, in 2019, Google hosted five Women of Color summits with a combined total attendance of nearly 1,500 women of color from over 20 countries.",,,,,,,,
"In 2020, we widened our lens to include all women of color across the company by hosting our first Women of Color summit for over 20,000 Googlers across more than 100 cities.",,,,,,,,
We are also proud to support the Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that provide additional support and community for underrepresented employees and their allies.,,,,,,,,
"Collectively, more than 35,000 employees across more than 50 countries actively participate as members of our 16 ERGs.",,,,,,,,
"These Googler-initiated networks are passionate about promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion at Google.",,,,,,,,
"Our work in hiring and retaining underrepresented communities at Google is having an impact for women in tech all over the world and for Black+ and Latinx+ people in the U.S. For example, since we began reporting, representation of women in tech roles at Google has grown from 16.6% in 2014 to 24.6% of our global tech workforce in 2020.",,,,,,,,
"During the summer of 2020, in the wake of widespread racial unrest in the U.S., and in partnership with Black employees, we made new commitments to do our part to increase racial equity, within the company and in the wider world in which we operate and live.",,,,,,,,
"Among other commitments, we set a goal to improve leadership representation of underrepresented groups by 30% by 2025.",,,,,,,,
"We also announced a $175 million+ economic opportunity package to support Black business owners, startup founders, job seekers, and developers, in addition to YouTube’s $100 million fund to amplify Black creators and artists.",,,,,,,,
Over the last year we have seen progress in a number of areas.,,,,,,,,
"Since 2018, we’ve continued to increase representation for women globally, and for Black+ and Latinx+ employees in the U.S. We saw the largest increase in our hiring of Black+ technical employees that we have ever measured.",,,,,,,,
"For more information on our diversity efforts, see Google’s Diversity Annual Report.",,,,,,,,
"When someone joins Google, we seek to provide resources to help them achieve their personal and professional success and well-being, and Google’s efforts in these areas are widely known.",,,,,,,,
"In fact, in Universum’s 2020 ranking of the World’s Most Attractive Employers, Google was ranked the number one employer for the 11th consecutive year, as well as number one for Engineering/IT.",,,,,,,,
"We aim to empower employees to act on great ideas regardless of their role or function within the company, and we provide training that helps them develop the skills to do so.",,,,,,,,
"We have an e-learning curriculum and conduct “Googler-to-Googler” training sessions, where people learn new 5 Google European Union NFRD Report 2021skills from their colleagues.",,,,,,,,
Google subsidizes outside studies related to an employee’s job responsibilities and—because we believe that fostering curiosity is key to success—also for employees to engage in external training unrelated to their function.,,,,,,,,
"In terms of physical resources, we build our offices with the goal of providing our employees with a first-rate work environment, and we engage in a process of continuous re-evaluation with respect to design and functionality to meet the needs of our people.",,,,,,,,
"Employee health is extremely important; we want our employees to live happy and healthy lives, both in and out of work.",,,,,,,,
Our benefits programs are designed to give employees control over their health and well-being and to make it easy for them to take care of themselves and their families.,,,,,,,,
"Globally, new parents, regardless of gender, receive a minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid leave to bond with their child (birth parents receive an additional 10–12 weeks of pregnancy recovery time).",,,,,,,,
"In addition, all new parents globally benefit from a two-week gradual return policy (ramping back to work part-time at full-time salary).",,,,,,,,
Google also supports all employees (including parents) in availing themselves of flexible working options such as part-time working and job sharing.,,,,,,,,
"We also provide baby-bonding benefits, which is a sum of money given to Googlers who are new parents to help pay for services that support them during the first period of being a parent (e.g., house cleaning, healthy take-out food) to allow them to maximize the time and energy they can spend with their new family member.",,,,,,,,
Social impact We know that diversity and inclusion are values critical to our success and future innovation.,,,,,,,,
We also know that challenging bias—inside and outside our organization—is the right thing to do.,,,,,,,,
That’s why we continue to support efforts that fuel our commitments to progress.,,,,,,,,
"These commitments require us to look at bias through a wider lens: at Google, in the industry, and in society.",,,,,,,,
"And while progress takes time, our actions today will determine who we are in the future.",,,,,,,,
Google has set company-wide goals to ensure that each of our products is highly accessible and to continue our emphasis on disability inclusion in our workforce.,,,,,,,,
"In 2019, we held our first ever Global Disability Alliance ERG summit.",,,,,,,,
This gathering was an opportunity for employees from around the world to come together to collaborate and discuss strategies for disability inclusion at work and for improving accessibility in our products and workplace.,,,,,,,,
"In 2019, we participated for the first time in the Disability Equality Index, which serves as a comprehensive benchmarking tool for disability inclusion.",,,,,,,,
"We were proud to earn a perfect score on this index in 2019 and again in 2020, and we’re committed to making every Googler feel welcome and included.",,,,,,,,
"6 Google European Union NFRD Report 2021Around the world, Google engineers, designers, and marketers are working to understand the needs of communities that have been underrepresented in tech.",,,,,,,,
"Because we’re building for billions of users who may not look or act or think like the teams building them, we need to make sure we’re bringing different perspectives to the table at key points in the process.",,,,,,,,
We are making sustained efforts to drive inclusion by design to enable inclusive products such as the Google Assistant.,,,,,,,,
"Launched in 2016 and now available in more than 90 countries and nearly 30 languages, Google Assistant helps more than 500 million people every month to get things done across smart speakers and Smart Displays, phones, TVs, cars, and more.",,,,,,,,
"Before launch, the product team worked with our product inclusion team and ERGs to avoid stereotypes, historical biases, offensive language, and hate speech.",,,,,,,,
"We also work with external partners to provide digital skills training for everyone, aimed at helping people find jobs or grow their business and career.",,,,,,,,
"For example, our Grow with Google workshops are designed to help ensure that everyone is able to participate in the digital economy.",,,,,,,,
"Our training programs range from basic online skills, like how websites work and how to reach customers with email, to more advanced topics, like tracking results with analytics and international marketing.",,,,,,,,
"As part of International Women’s Day in 2020, Google supported the virtual networking event and information booth at the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Worldwide Conference.",,,,,,,,
"WiDS Worldwide hosted about 2,200 attendees representing 65 countries, 30% of whom visited our virtual Google booth.",,,,,,,,
"Throughout the rest of the year, 120 Women@Google global chapters from 52 countries engaged tens of thousands of employees virtually to discuss career development and programs to improve our culture.",,,,,,,,
"In 2020, we partnered with women’s student organizations—as well as organizations focused on people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, Black+ and LGBTQ+ communities, and other underrepresented demographics— across approximately 450 universities in North America and Europe to host over 350 events.",,,,,,,,
"Also in 2020, Google’s Women Techmakers program supported our external Ambassadors in hosting around 200 community-led events for International Women's Day to inspire and empower over 80,000 women in tech globally.",,,,,,,,
"These events provide women with opportunities to develop their technical skills, celebrate their achievements through #IamRemarkable workshops, and continue to build networks in the tech industry.",,,,,,,,
"By the end of 2020, #IamRemarkable workshops had reached over 185,000 participants in more than 15,000 workshops across 150 countries.",,,,,,,,
"Almost half (49%) of workshop participants reported experiencing growth in their jobs, their careers, or both, which they attributed to #IamRemarkable.",,,,,,,,
"7 Google European Union NFRD Report 2021As a part of our aforementioned commitments to racial equity, Google.org pledged $12 million to support organizations working to advance racial justice.",,,,,,,,
"Among them were $1 million grants each to The Leadership Conference Education Fund, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the NAACP Educational Fund’s Policing Reform Campaign, and the Center for Policing Equity.",,,,,,,,
"To support nonprofits in 2020, we committed a total of $1 billion in Ad Grants.",,,,,,,,
"Since 2003, Ad Grants has provided nonprofits with up to $10,000 per month in free Search ads to help them attract donors, recruit volunteers, and promote their missions.",,,,,,,,
The increased funding went toward nonprofits tackling pressing issues like COVID-19 response and recovery—especially in hard-hit developing economies—and fighting racial injustice around the world.,,,,,,,,
"In March 2021, Google.org launched the global $25 million Impact Challenge for Women and Girls to support nonprofits and social organizations around the world that are working to advance the economic empowerment of women and girls and create pathways to prosperity.",,,,,,,,
"Impact Challenge grantees will receive funding, mentoring from Googlers, Ad Grants, and additional support to bring their ideas to life.",,,,,,,,
"Over the last five years, Google.org has provided $55 million to nonprofit organizations supporting gender equity, and the Impact Challenge builds on this long-standing work.",,,,,,,,
"Respect of human rights We are committed to respecting the human rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its implementing treaties, as well as to upholding the standards established in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the Global Network Initiative (GNI) Principles.",,,,,,,,
"Google conducts our work on civil rights and human rights through our Human Rights Program, a central function consisting of experts in the field supporting our efforts to ensure that we are meeting our commitment to the UNGPs, GNI Principles, and other civil and human rights instruments.",,,,,,,,
"The Human Rights Program develops and advances company-wide strategy on civil and human rights, advises product teams on potential civil and human rights impacts, conducts human rights due diligence, and engages external experts and stakeholders.",,,,,,,,
"Dedicated personnel are focused on product, regional, and functional areas, and they are responsible for the day-to-day operations of protecting our users and ensuring compliance with legal requirements.",,,,,,,,
"Senior management develops the strategy around and oversees the implementation of civil and human rights commitments and GNI Principles at Google and provides regular updates on relevant issues to the members of our Audit and Compliance 8 Google European Union NFRD Report 2021Committee in accordance with its Charter, which was amended in 2020 to explicitly include risk oversight of civil and human rights issues.",,,,,,,,
The Audit and Compliance Committee also provides pertinent reports to the full Board of Directors to ensure that it is apprised of these matters.,,,,,,,,
"As we grow as a company, we continue to enhance and evolve our implementation of our human rights commitments.",,,,,,,,
"For example, we have established a Human Rights Executive Council to provide oversight and guidance to our Human Rights Program on global human rights and domestic civil rights in the U.S. Council members represent key product areas and functions across Google and regularly hear from the leaders of the Human Rights Program.",,,,,,,,
More information on our human rights commitments can be found at Google: Human Rights.,,,,,,,,
"We are founding members of GNI, a multi-stakeholder nongovernmental organization working to advance free expression and privacy.",,,,,,,,
"The GNI Principles are informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and they concretize Information and Communication Technology companies’ responsibility to respect and promote the freedom of expression and privacy rights of their users.",,,,,,,,
"As part of GNI, we work to protect, promote, and support human rights, including through improved responsible decision-making, shared learning, and multi-stakeholder collaboration.",,,,,,,,
Senior management oversees the implementation of the human rights and GNI Principles at Google and provides quarterly updates on relevant issues to the members of our Board of Directors.,,,,,,,,
"As a GNI member, Google is subject to a periodic assessment by an independent party to review how the company integrates GNI Principles into our governance, due diligence and risk management, and operational practices.",,,,,,,,
GNI makes these company assessments publicly available.,,,,,,,,
"At our foundation, Google’s Code of Conduct sets forth our expectations for employees regarding privacy, security, freedom of expression, discrimination, harassment, corruption, and compliance with all laws, including anti-modern slavery legislation.",,,,,,,,
The Code encourages employees to raise questions or concerns about the Code and to report suspected violations.,,,,,,,,
"Employees failing to follow the Code can be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.",,,,,,,,
"Failure of a Google contractor, consultant, or other covered service provider to follow the Code in connection with their services to Google can result in termination of their relationship with Google.",,,,,,,,
"Our Code of Conduct training reinforces the expectation that employees, temporary workers, and contractors (collectively, “our workers”) follow applicable laws and report concerns of illegal or unethical activity.",,,,,,,,
"We are committed to maintaining a culture that encourages employees and others to report concerns related to violations of our Code of Conduct, policies, or laws, including our human rights commitments.",,,,,,,,
That is why we have adopted and promoted policies that strictly prohibit retaliation of any kind for 9 Google European Union NFRD Report 2021raising such concerns or for participating in an investigation relating to such concerns.,,,,,,,,
"When we learn about a potential violation of our policies or Code of Conduct, we look into the concern consistent with our robust process for carefully investigating such allegations and then make appropriate remedial recommendations.",,,,,,,,
"Throughout this process, we keep information, including the identity of the individuals raising the concern, as confidential as possible, sharing only on a need-to-know basis.",,,,,,,,
Our commitment extends beyond our own practices to those of our suppliers.,,,,,,,,
"We have a Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Supplier Code”), which is based on the Responsible Business Alliance (formerly the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition) Code of Conduct; international standards, such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and our own values.",,,,,,,,
"The Supplier Code sets standards designed to protect the health, safety, and treatment of workers; minimize their environmental impact; combat corruption; respect freedom of association and collective bargaining; comply with minimum wage laws; and prohibit any form of forced, bonded (including debt bondage), or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, sex trafficking, and slavery or trafficking of people.",,,,,,,,
"We expect our suppliers to source only from conflict-free smelters, such as those that are compliant with Conflict-Free Smelter Program assessment protocols, and work with suppliers to achieve conflict-free sourcing.",,,,,,,,
Alphabet’s Conflict Minerals Policy directs suppliers to perform due diligence on the source and chain of custody of minerals used to manufacture products for Google.,,,,,,,,
"We strive to protect our users’ privacy, free expression, and secure access to the web when they use Google products.",,,,,,,,
"We outline how we safeguard privacy and security on our safety site , give users control over their information through Google Account , and detail our efforts toward protecting online expression and access to information in our statements on freedom of expression .",,,,,,,,
We’re also committed to complying with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation.,,,,,,,,
"In 2018, we updated and improved our Privacy Policy , making it easier to understand, adding informative videos that explain our practices, and embedding key privacy controls directly in the text.",,,,,,,,
"We also updated the privacy and security settings in Google Account, which ensures users can easily see their data and set their preferences for how Google should store and use their information, including pausing or deleting Search or YouTube history or disabling personalized ads.",,,,,,,,
"In 2019, we introduced auto-delete controls, which give you the choice to have Google automatically and continuously delete your Location History, search, voice, and YouTube activity data after 3 months or 18 months.",,,,,,,,
"In 2020, we made auto-delete the default for our core activity 10 Google European Union NFRD Report 2021settings and announced updates to many of our privacy tools, including Google Account controls directly from Search, easier access to Incognito mode, more proactive privacy controls, and others.",,,,,,,,
We continue to develop and improve these and other tools to make them more robust and intuitive.,,,,,,,,
"In June 2018, we announced the Google AI Principles: seven principles to guide the ethical development of our Artificial Intelligence work.",,,,,,,,
"In addition to these seven principles, we have identified AI applications we will not pursue, including designing or deploying AI in technologies whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.",,,,,,,,
These are concrete standards that govern our research and product development and impact our business decisions.,,,,,,,,
"We established a formal review structure to assess new projects, products, and deals for alignment with the principles.",,,,,,,,
"This diverse and inclusive group of Googlers includes senior executives, user researchers, social scientists, ethicists, human rights specialists, policy and privacy advisors, legal experts, and senior experts from a variety of other disciplines.",,,,,,,,
We believe restrictions on the freedom of expression should be consistent with international human rights laws or standards and the rule of law and be necessary and proportionate for the relevant purpose.,,,,,,,,
"We also believe that laws around government surveillance of user information should be narrowly tailored, transparent, and subject to oversight.",,,,,,,,
"We publish Transparency Reports, with the mission of sharing data that sheds light on how the policies and actions of governments and corporations affect privacy, security, and access to information.",,,,,,,,
We also continue to innovate around product-specific transparency with YouTube’s industry-leading transparency reporting on how it enforces the Community Guidelines.,,,,,,,,
We are committed to tackling the challenge of quickly removing content that violates our Community Guidelines and reporting on our progress.,,,,,,,,
"That is why, in April 2018, we launched a quarterly YouTube Community Guidelines enforcement report.",,,,,,,,
Recent examples of Google’s work on human rights issues include developments in content quality policies and facial recognition applications.,,,,,,,,
"On content quality, one of the most complex and constantly evolving areas we deal with is hate speech.",,,,,,,,
"In 2019, YouTube took a close look at its approach towards hateful content in consultation with dozens of experts in subjects like violent extremism, supremacism, civil rights, and free speech.",,,,,,,,
"Based on those learnings, YouTube made several updates to its hate speech policy including removing more hateful and supremacist content, reducing borderline content and raising up authoritative voices, and continuing to reward trusted creators and enforce monetization policies.",,,,,,,,
"Similarly, our ongoing work on information integrity led to the release of a white paper in 2019 detailing our work to tackle the intentional spread of disinformation across Google Search, Google News, YouTube, and its advertising systems.",,,,,,,,
"11 Google European Union NFRD Report 2021In 2019, in collaboration with independent experts using the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as a framework, Google commissioned a formal human rights impact assessment (HRIA) of the Celebrity Recognition tool and technology’s potential impact on human rights.",,,,,,,,
"The HRIA played an essential role in shaping the application program interface’s capabilities and the policies established around them, and we publicly released a summary of the HRIA.",,,,,,,,
Our Chief Compliance Officer oversees a team focused on combating modern slavery in the company’s supply chains and business operations.,,,,,,,,
"The Chief Compliance Officer provides quarterly updates on the status of our Anti-Modern Slavery Program to our Compliance Steering Committee, composed of senior executives from across our business.",,,,,,,,
"In addition, our Chief Compliance Officer provides regular updates on our anti-modern slavery efforts to the Audit and Compliance Committee of Alphabet’s Board of Directors.",,,,,,,,
"Regular updates on the status of the Responsible Supply Chain Program—which includes addressing human rights risk, among many other areas—are provided to our Supplier Responsibility Steering Team, composed of our Chief Compliance Officer and leaders from Google’s direct and indirect supply chains.",,,,,,,,
Our Policy Against Modern Slavery prohibits knowingly engaging in or supporting human trafficking and child labor practices in our business operations.,,,,,,,,
"Any violation of our standards by a Google employee can result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment.",,,,,,,,
Any violation by a supplier can result in contract termination.,,,,,,,,
"Recently, we published our fifth annual Statement Against Modern Slavery , which provides more detail on our efforts to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place in our supply chains and business operations.",,,,,,,,
We perform periodic independent third-party audits at hardware and non-hardware suppliers’ facilities.,,,,,,,,
"The audits include in-depth tours, meetings with management, worker interviews, document reviews, and assessments of related areas, such as dormitories, cafeterias, wastewater treatment facilities, and warehouses.",,,,,,,,
"The audit protocol is designed to assess suppliers’ performance in the areas covered by our Supplier Code, including human rights risk.",,,,,,,,
We work with our suppliers to determine root causes and develop corrective action plans for any issues identified during the audit.,,,,,,,,
"While our audits are announced, our supplier managers are trained to report any concerns they might observe on an ongoing basis.",,,,,,,,
"In 2020, we published our fourth annual Supplier Responsibility Report.",,,,,,,,
This report provides more detailed information about our above-mentioned audit and supplier engagement efforts.,,,,,,,,
"As part of our efforts to identify and mitigate human rights risks in our supply chain, we also conduct due diligence on our direct suppliers and vendors, which include both product and service suppliers, identified as 12 Google European Union NFRD Report 2021having higher risk through our risk assessments.",,,,,,,,
"As part of the due diligence process, suppliers complete a self-assessment questionnaire about their working conditions and management systems.",,,,,,,,
"The due diligence process also includes background checks, examination of labor-related red flags that appear in publicly available databases and media sources, and a review of higher-risk suppliers’ names against human trafficking watch lists.",,,,,,,,
"If we discover red flags, we remediate these issues and document them.",,,,,,,,
"In certain cases, we may decide to no longer pursue a relationship or to terminate our current relationship with a supplier.",,,,,,,,
Our workers who manage relationships with higher-risk suppliers identified in our risk assessment receive supplemental in-person training.,,,,,,,,
"In addition, we have an online training course that covers all of the aspects of our Supplier Code for our workers in roles related to hardware supplier management.",,,,,,,,
"This training helps our workers identify human rights red flags, shares best practices, and instructs our workers to report human rights concerns.",,,,,,,,
"Certain areas of our business, such as our hardware production, present human rights risks we’ve been working to eradicate; however, we appreciate that there are risks present in many aspects of our business that we must continue to work to understand and address.",,,,,,,,
"Working to mitigate human rights risk is an ongoing process, and we continually strive to assess this risk in all facets of our business.",,,,,,,,
"Finally, we seek to apply technological innovation to advance social good in the diverse communities and contexts in which we operate.",,,,,,,,
"Thus, we support technology-focused social impact projects and provide resources to help nonprofits tackle challenges such as human trafficking, education, and economic development through Google’s AI for Social Good program and AI Impact Challenge.",,,,,,,,
Anti-corruption and bribery matters Google recognizes that corruption adversely impacts economic growth and disproportionately harms the most vulnerable people and communities around the world.,,,,,,,,
"As with our modern slavery efforts, Google’s Chief Compliance Officer oversees a legal team dedicated to preventing corruption in the company’s business operations and supply chain.",,,,,,,,

We continually strive to assess corruption risk in all facets of our business.,,,,,,,,
"As with other companies in our industry, bribery and corruption risks posed by working with third parties and intermediaries remain a significant corruption risk to Google.",,,,,,,,
We undertake a number of efforts to mitigate the risk of bribery and corruption both in our company’s operations as well as in our supply chain.,,,,,,,,
"Below are a few key examples: • We maintain an anti-bribery third-party due diligence program, where we conduct documented, risk-based due diligence pertaining to the engagement of third parties and channel partners.",,,,,,,,
• We routinely inform business partners of Google’s commitment to abide by anti-bribery laws and seek a reciprocal commitment from them by including anti-corruption compliance language in our contracts.,,,,,,,,

,1 European Union NFRD Report 2020Google’s business model Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.,,,,,,,
,"Google’s business includes our main products such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube.",,,,,,,
,Our technical infrastructure is also included in Google.,,,,,,,
,Google generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising.,,,,,,,
,"We continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that will grow revenues beyond advertising, including Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube.",,,,,,,
,We are also investing in research efforts in AI and quantum computing to foster innovation across our businesses and create new opportunities.,,,,,,,
,"For more information on Google’s business model, see Alphabet’s annual report .",,,,,,,
,"Environmental initiatives Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time, and we’ve long been committed to improving our energy consumption.",,,,,,,
,Operating Google’s business in an environmentally sustainable way has been a core value since our founding.,,,,,,,
,We’re focused on tackling our energy consumption through a threefold strategy for carbon neutrality.,,,,,,,
,"First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energy efficiency initiatives.",,,,,,,
,"Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy; we’re the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world.1 Third, we buy high-quality carbon offsets for any remaining emissions we haven’t yet eliminated.",,,,,,,
,"Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, and in 2019, we purchased enough renewable energy to match 100% of the electricity we consumed for our global operations for the third consecutive year.",,,,,,,
,"Since 2010, Google has signed more than 50 power purchase agreements totaling more than 5 gigawatts of renewable energy.",,,,,,,
,These deals have enabled almost $7 billion in investments in renewable energy projects across the globe.,,,,,,,
,"Google’s data centers are the heart of our company, powering products like Search, Gmail, and YouTube for billions of people around the world, 24/7.",,,,,,,
,"For more than a decade, we’ve worked to make Google data centers more efficient and have striven to improve their environmental performance even as demand for our products has dramatically risen.",,,,,,,
,"On average, a Google data center is twice as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center.",,,,,,,
,"In 2019, the average annual power usage effectiveness (PUE) for our global fleet of data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.672— meaning that Google data centers use about six times less overhead energy for every unit of IT equipment energy.",,,,,,,
,"2 European Union NFRD Report 20202At Google, just as we focus on users in designing our products, we focus on our employees in creating healthy workplaces, from our San Francisco Bay Area headquarters to Google offices at diverse sites in more than 150 cities around the world.",,,,,,,
,"At the end of 2018, over 1.2 million square meters (13 million square feet) of Google office facilities had achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification.",,,,,,,
,We also put Google technology to work helping others study and respond to environmental challenges.,,,,,,,
,"We’re working with numerous research and nonprofit organizations to map the world’s forests, oceans, watersheds, and air quality, then helping to get that information into the hands of decision- makers.",,,,,,,
,"We do this by working with partners to build tools like Global Forest Watch, Global Fishing Watch, Project Sunroof, Project Air View, Global Surface Water Explorer, and the DiSARM platform for malaria risk mapping.",,,,,,,
,"For more information about our environmental sustainability initiatives, risk assessments, and key performance indicators, see our 2019 Environmental Report and our 2019 CDP Climate Change response .",,,,,,,
,"Alphabet has earned a position on CDP’s Climate Change A List, which recognizes leadership on climate action and transparency, for five consecutive years.",,,,,,,
,Employee matters We recognize that our employees are our best assets and critical to our continued success.,,,,,,,
,"We invest heavily in hiring talented individuals, and we seek to hire people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives.",,,,,,,
,Google’s Code of Conduct provides a guide as to how our employees are expected to put Google’s values into practice as they pursue the company’s mission.,,,,,,,
,This includes respect for one another and for our users.,,,,,,,
,"Employees are expected to create and preserve a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias, and unlawful discrimination.",,,,,,,
,"Code of Conduct training is provided to all Google employees at all levels of the organization, and we offer unconscious bias training both online and in person.",,,,,,,
,"In an effort to accelerate our commitments to be a representative, equitable, and respectful workplace, we are increasing transparency around Googlers’ concerns and how we handle them, as well as increasing support for people who raise concerns.",,,,,,,
,"In 2019, we updated our Internal Investigations Report to include a new section providing detail about internal sexual harassment investigations as well as expanded sexual harassment scenarios that reflect examples of the types of conduct that may result in termination of employment.",,,,,,,
,"Last year we also publicly shared our Policy on Harassment, Discrimination, Retaliation, Standards of Conduct, and Workplace Concerns , as well as our processes and channels for raising and investigating concerns.",,,,,,,
,"3 European Union NFRD Report 20203When we say we want to build for everyone, we mean everyone.",,,,,,,
,"To do that well, we need a workforce that’s more representative of the users we serve.",,,,,,,
,"That’s why diversity, equity, and inclusion are business imperatives for Google.",,,,,,,
,"They improve outcomes for our employees, our products, and our users.",,,,,,,
,"Google’s leaders share responsibility for a company-wide goal to foster a representative, accessible, and inclusive workplace for everyone.",,,,,,,
,"We continue to focus on developing, progressing, and retaining women and employees from underrepresented communities at all stages of their careers.",,,,,,,
,"For example, in 2019, Google hosted five Women of Color summits with a combined total attendance of nearly 1,500 women of color from over 20 countries.",,,,,,,
,"These summits provided an opportunity for employees to learn more about diversity strategy, connect with their communities, and directly engage with senior leadership.",,,,,,,
,We are also proud to support the Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that provide additional support and community for underrepresented employees and their allies.,,,,,,,
,"Collectively, more than 35,000 employees across 52 countries actively participate as members of our 16 ERGs.",,,,,,,
,"These Googler-initiated networks are passionate about promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion at Google.",,,,,,,
,Underrepresented communities within Google have grown significantly faster than Google as a whole.,,,,,,,
,"For example, since we began reporting in 2014, representation of women in tech roles at Google has grown from 16.6% to 23.6% of our global tech workforce, and representation of Black+ Googlers in the U.S. has grown from 2.4% to 3.7%.",,,,,,,
,"For the second year in a row, representation of women in leadership roles globally at Google grew 0.6%, reaching 26.7%.",,,,,,,
,"Given Google’s growth rate, this progress represents thousands of new underrepresented employees joining our ranks in the last six years.",,,,,,,
,"For more information on our diversity efforts, see Google’s 2020 Diversity Report .",,,,,,,
,"When someone joins Google, we seek to provide resources to help them achieve their personal and professional success and well-being, and Google’s efforts in these areas are widely known.",,,,,,,
,"In fact, in Universum’s 2019 ranking of the World’s Most Attractive Employers , Google was ranked the number one employer for the 10th consecutive year, as well as number one for Engineering/IT.",,,,,,,
,"We aim to empower employees to act on great ideas regardless of their role or function within the company, and we provide training that helps them develop the skills to do so.",,,,,,,
,"We have an e-learning curriculum and conduct “Googler-to-Googler” training sessions, where people learn new skills from their colleagues.",,,,,,,
,Google subsidizes outside studies related to an employee’s job responsibilities and—because we believe that fostering curiosity is key to success—also for employees to engage in external training unrelated to their function.,,,,,,,
,"4 European Union NFRD Report 2020In terms of physical resources, we build our offices with the goal of providing our employees with a first-rate work environment, and we engage in a process of continuous re-evaluation with respect to design and functionality to meet the needs of our people.",,,,,,,
,"Employee health is extremely important; we want our employees to live happy and healthy lives, both in and out of work.",,,,,,,
,Our benefits programs are designed to give employees control over their health and well-being and to make it easy for them to take care of themselves and their families.,,,,,,,
,"Globally, new parents, regardless of gender, receive a minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid leave to bond with their child (birth mothers receive an additional 10–12 weeks of pregnancy recovery time).",,,,,,,
,"In addition, all new parents globally benefit from a two-week gradual return policy (ramping back to work part-time at full-time salary).",,,,,,,
,Google also supports all employees (including parents) in availing themselves of flexible working options such as part-time working and job sharing.,,,,,,,
,"We also provide baby-bonding benefits, which is a sum of money given to Googlers who are new parents to help pay for services that support them during the first period of being a parent (e.g., house cleaning, healthy take-out food) to allow them to maximize the time and energy they can spend with their new family member.",,,,,,,
,Social impact We know that diversity and inclusion are values critical to our success and future innovation.,,,,,,,
,We also know that challenging bias—inside and outside our organization—is the right thing to do.,,,,,,,
,That’s why we continue to support efforts that fuel our commitments to progress.,,,,,,,
,"These commitments require us to look at bias through a wider lens: at Google, in the industry, and in society.",,,,,,,
,"And while progress takes time, our actions today will determine who we are in the future.",,,,,,,
,Google has set company-wide goals to ensure that each of our products is highly accessible and to continue our emphasis on disability inclusion in our workforce.,,,,,,,
,"In 2019, we held our first ever Global Disability Alliance ERG summit.",,,,,,,
,This gathering was an opportunity for employees from around the world to come together to collaborate and discuss strategies for disability inclusion at work and for improving accessibility in our products and workplace.,,,,,,,
,"In 2019, we participated in the Disability Equality Index , which serves as a comprehensive benchmarking tool for disability inclusion.",,,,,,,
,We were proud to earn a top score on this index and are committed to making every Googler feel welcome and included.,,,,,,,
,"Measuring inclusion is nuanced, and these are just a few of the tools that allow us to do our work.",,,,,,,
,"Around the world, Google engineers, designers, and marketers are working to understand the needs of communities who have been underrepresented in tech.",,,,,,,
,"Because we’re building for billions of users who may not look or act 5 European Union NFRD Report 2020or think like the teams building them, we need to make sure we’re bringing different perspectives to the table at key points in the process.",,,,,,,
,We are making sustained efforts to drive inclusion by design to enable inclusive products such as the Google Assistant.,,,,,,,
,"Launched in 2016, it’s now available in 42 languages and more than 90 countries, helping more than 500 million people every month.",,,,,,,
,"Before launch, the product team worked with our product inclusion team and ERGs to avoid stereotypes, historical biases, offensive language, and hate speech.",,,,,,,
,"We also work with external partners to provide digital skills training for everyone, aimed at helping people find jobs or grow their business and career.",,,,,,,
,"For example, our Grow with Google in-person coaching workshops provide help for women-owned businesses that are part of Google’s Supplier Diversity program.",,,,,,,
,The aim of Grow with Google is to help ensure that everyone is able to participate in the digital economy.,,,,,,,
,"Our training programs range from basic online skills, like how websites work and how to reach customers with email, to more advanced topics, like tracking results with analytics and international marketing.",,,,,,,
,"On International Women’s Day in 2019, 120 Women@Google global chapters from 52 countries engaged tens of thousands of employees to discuss career development and programs to improve our culture.",,,,,,,
,"As part of this day, Grow with Google in Europe, Middle East, and Africa partnered with Inspiring Girls International to launch a video hub of filmed talks by diverse female role models as a go-to motivational resource for young girls.",,,,,,,
,We partnered with women’s student organizations across more than 235 universities in the United States and Europe to host nearly 950 events in 2019.,,,,,,,
,"We also hosted 19 global Women Techmakers summits and supported more than 300 community-led meet-ups across 87 countries to empower more than 35,000 women in the tech industry.",,,,,,,
,"These events provide women opportunities to develop their technical skills, celebrate their achievements through #IamRemarkable workshops, and continue to build networks in the tech industry.",,,,,,,
,"Respect of human rights We are committed to respecting the human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its implementing treaties, as well as in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Global Network Initiative Principles .",,,,,,,
,"At our foundation, Google’s Code of Conduct sets forth our expectations for employees regarding privacy, security, freedom of expression, discrimination, harassment, corruption, and compliance with all laws, including anti-modern slavery legislation.",,,,,,,
,The Code encourages employees to raise questions or concerns about the Code and to report suspected 6 European Union NFRD Report 2020violations.,,,,,,,
,"Employees failing to follow the Code can be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.",,,,,,,
,"Failure of a Google contractor, consultant, or other covered service provider to follow the Code in connection with their services to Google can result in termination of their relationship with Google.",,,,,,,
,"Our Code of Conduct training reinforces the expectation that employees, temporary workers, and contractors (collectively, “our workers”) follow applicable laws and report concerns of illegal or unethical activity.",,,,,,,
,Our commitment extends beyond our own employment practices to those of our suppliers.,,,,,,,
,"We have a Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Supplier Code”), which is based on the Responsible Business Alliance (formerly the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition) Code of Conduct ; international standards, such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and our own values.",,,,,,,
,"The Supplier Code sets standards designed to protect the health, safety, and treatment of workers; minimize their environmental impact; combat corruption; respect freedom of association and collective bargaining; comply with minimum wage laws; and prohibit any form of forced, bonded (including debt bondage), or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, sex trafficking, and slavery or trafficking of people.",,,,,,,
,"We expect our suppliers to source only from conflict-free smelters, such as those that are compliant with Conflict-Free Smelter Program assessment protocols, and work with suppliers to achieve conflict-free sourcing.",,,,,,,
,Our Conflict Minerals Policy directs suppliers to perform due diligence on the source and chain of custody of minerals used to manufacture products for Google.,,,,,,,
,"We strive to protect our users’ privacy, free expression, and secure access to the web when they use Google products.",,,,,,,
,"We outline how we safeguard privacy and security on our safety site , give users control over their information through Google Account , and detail our efforts toward protecting online expression and access to information in our statements on freedom of expression .",,,,,,,
,We’re also committed to complying with Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation.,,,,,,,
,"In 2018, we updated and improved our Privacy Policy , making it easier to understand, adding informative videos that explain our practices, and embedding key privacy controls directly in the text.",,,,,,,
,"We also updated the privacy and security settings in Google Account, which ensures users can easily see their data and set their preferences for how Google should store and use their information, including pausing or deleting Search or YouTube history or disabling personalized ads.",,,,,,,
,We continue to develop and improve these and other tools to make them more robust and intuitive.,,,,,,,
,"In June 2018, we announced the Google AI Principles : seven principles to guide the ethical development of our Artificial Intelligence work.",,,,,,,
,"In addition to these seven principles, we have identified AI applications we will not 7 European Union NFRD Report 2020pursue, including designing or deploying AI in technologies whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.",,,,,,,
,These are concrete standards that govern our research and product development and impact our business decisions.,,,,,,,
,"We established a formal review structure to assess new projects, products, and deals for alignment with the principles.",,,,,,,
,"This diverse and inclusive group of Googlers includes senior executives, user researchers, social scientists, ethicists, human rights specialists, policy and privacy advisors, legal experts, and senior experts from a variety of other disciplines.",,,,,,,
,"We are founding members of the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a multi-stakeholder nongovernmental organization working to advance free expression and privacy.",,,,,,,
,"The GNI Principles are informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and they concretize Information and Communication Technology companies’ responsibility to respect and promote the freedom of expression and privacy rights of their users.",,,,,,,
,"As part of GNI, we work to protect, promote, and support human rights, including through improved responsible decision-making, shared learning, and multi- stakeholder collaboration.",,,,,,,
,Senior management oversees the implementation of the human rights and GNI Principles at Google and provides quarterly updates on relevant issues to the members of our Board of Directors.,,,,,,,
,We believe restrictions on the freedom of expression should be consistent with international human rights laws or standards and the rule of law and be necessary and proportionate for the relevant purpose.,,,,,,,
,"We also believe that laws around government surveillance of user information should be narrowly tailored, transparent, and subject to oversight .",,,,,,,
,"We publish Transparency Reports , which shed light on how laws and policies affect internet users and the flow of information online.",,,,,,,
,Recent examples of Google’s work on human rights issues include developments in content quality policies and facial recognition applications.,,,,,,,
,"On content quality, one of the most complex and constantly evolving areas we deal with is hate speech.",,,,,,,
,"In 2019, YouTube took a close look at its approach towards hateful content in consultation with dozens of experts in subjects like violent extremism, supremacism, civil rights, and free speech.",,,,,,,
,"Based on those learnings, YouTube made several updates to its hate speech policy including removing more hateful and supremacist content, reducing borderline content and raising up authoritative voices, and continuing to reward trusted creators and enforce monetization policies.",,,,,,,
,"Similarly, our ongoing work on information integrity led to the release of a white paper in 2019 detailing our work to tackle the intentional spread of disinformation across Google Search, Google News, YouTube, and its advertising systems.",,,,,,,
,"In 2019, in collaboration with independent experts using the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as a framework, Google commissioned a formal human rights impact assessment (HRIA) of the 8 European Union NFRD Report 2020Celebrity Recognition tool and technology’s potential impact on human rights.",,,,,,,
,"The HRIA played an essential role in shaping the application program interface’s capabilities and the policies established around them, and we publicly released a summary of the HRIA .",,,,,,,
,Our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer oversees a team focused on combating modern slavery in the company’s supply chains and business operations.,,,,,,,
,"The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer provides quarterly updates on the status of our Anti-Modern Slavery Program to our Compliance Steering Committee, composed of senior executives from across our business.",,,,,,,
,"In addition, our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer provides regular updates on our anti-modern slavery efforts to the Audit Committee of Alphabet’s Board of Directors.",,,,,,,
,"Regular updates on the status of the Responsible Supply Chain Program—which includes addressing human rights risk, among many other areas—are provided to our Responsible Supply Chains Steering Committee, composed of our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and leaders from Google’s direct and indirect supply chains.",,,,,,,
,Our Policy Against Modern Slavery prohibits knowingly engaging in or supporting human trafficking and child labor practices in our business operations.,,,,,,,
,"Any violation of our standards by a Google employee can result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment.",,,,,,,
,Any violation by a supplier can result in contract termination.,,,,,,,
,"Recently, we published our fourth annual Modern Slavery Statement , which provides more detail on our efforts to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place in our supply chains and business operations.",,,,,,,
,We perform periodic independent third-party audits at hardware and non-hardware suppliers’ facilities.,,,,,,,
,"The audits include in-depth factory tours, meetings with management, on-site worker interviews, document reviews, and assessments of related areas, such as dormitories, cafeterias, wastewater treatment facilities, and warehouses.",,,,,,,
,"The audit protocol is designed to assess suppliers’ performance in the areas covered by our Supplier Code, including human rights risk.",,,,,,,
,We work with our suppliers to determine root causes and develop corrective action plans for any issues identified during the audit.,,,,,,,
,"While our audits are announced, our supplier managers are trained to report any concerns they might observe on an ongoing basis.",,,,,,,
,"In 2019, we published our third annual Responsible Supply Chain Report .",,,,,,,
,This report provides more detailed information about our above-mentioned audit and supplier engagement efforts.,,,,,,,
,"As part of our efforts to mitigate human rights risks in our supply chain, we also conduct due diligence on our direct suppliers and vendors, which include both product and service suppliers, identified as having higher risk through our risk assessments.",,,,,,,
,"As part of the due diligence process, suppliers complete a self-assessment questionnaire about their working conditions and management systems.",,,,,,,
,"The due diligence process also includes 9 European Union NFRD Report 2020background checks, examination of labor-related red flags that appear in publicly available databases and media sources, and a review of higher-risk suppliers’ names against human trafficking watch lists.",,,,,,,
,"If we discover red flags, we remediate these issues and document them.",,,,,,,
,"In certain cases, we may decide to no longer pursue a relationship or to terminate our current relationship with a supplier.",,,,,,,
,Our workers who manage relationships with higher-risk suppliers identified in our risk assessment receive supplemental in-person training.,,,,,,,
,"In addition, we have an online training course that covers all of the aspects of our Supplier Code for our workers in roles related to hardware supplier management.",,,,,,,
,"This training helps our workers identify human rights red flags, shares best practices, and instructs our workers to report human rights concerns.",,,,,,,
,"Certain areas of our business, such as our hardware production, present human rights risks we have been working to eradicate; however, we appreciate that there are risks present in many aspects of our business that we must continue to work to understand and address.",,,,,,,
,"Working to mitigate human rights risk is an ongoing process, and we continually strive to assess this risk in all facets of our business.",,,,,,,
,"Finally, we seek to apply technological innovation to advance social good in the diverse communities and contexts in which we operate.",,,,,,,
,"Thus, we support technology-focused social impact projects and provide resources to help nonprofits tackle challenges such as human trafficking, education, and economic development through Google’s AI for Social Good program and Social Impact Challenge .",,,,,,,
,Anti-corruption and bribery matters Google recognizes that corruption adversely impacts economic growth and disproportionately harms the most vulnerable people and communities around the world.,,,,,,,
,"As with our modern slavery efforts, Google’s Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer oversees a legal team dedicated to preventing corruption in the company’s business operations and supply chain.",,,,,,,
,"The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer provides quarterly updates on the status of our anti- corruption compliance program to the Compliance Steering Committee, as well as the Audit Committee of Alphabet’s Board of Directors.",,,,,,,
,"Google’s Code of Conduct requires compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.",,,,,,,
,"We also have an Anti-Bribery and Government Ethics Policy, which prohibits bribery and facilitation payments in our business operations and requires legal pre-approvals for certain types of government-related expenses.",,,,,,,
,"A 10 European Union NFRD Report 2020Google employee, contractor, service provider, supplier, or vendor who directly or indirectly gives, offers, or promises anything of value to anyone, including government officials, with the corrupt intent to obtain or retain any improper advantage will be disciplined up to and including termination of employment or business relationship.",,,,,,,

,"Finally, we also periodically supplement our online trainings with live instruction.",,,,,,,

,,Alphabet is a collection of businesses—the largest of which is Google.,,,,,,
,,Google is reported in two segments—Google Services and Google Cloud.,,,,,,
,,Our Google Services segment generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising.,,,,,,
,,"We continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that we expect to grow revenues beyond advertising, including revenues from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube non-advertising.",,,,,,
,,"Our Google Cloud segment generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.",,,,,,
,,"Our headquarters are located in Mountain View, California.",,,,,,
,,We also own and lease office and building space in the surrounding areas near our headquarters.,,,,,,
,,"In addition, we own and lease office/building space and research and development sites around the world, primarily in North America, Europe, South America, and Asia.",,,,,,

,,"Environmental initiatives Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time, and we’ve long been committed to reducing our environmental impact.",,,,,,
,,Operating Google’s business in an environmentally sustainable way has been a core value since our founding.,,,,,,
,,"In 2007, Google committed to being carbon neutral, and we’ve met this goal every year since then.",,,,,,
,,We reach carbon neutrality via three steps.,,,,,,
,,"First, we work to reduce our total energy consumption by pursuing aggressive energy efficiency initiatives.",,,,,,
,,"Second, we match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy; we’re the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world, based on renewable electricity purchased in megawatt-hours.",,,,,,
,,"Third, we buy high-quality carbon credits to compensate for any remaining emissions we haven’t yet eliminated.",,,,,,
,,"In 2020, we purchased enough renewable energy to match 100% of the electricity we consumed for our global operations for the fourth consecutive year.",,,,,,
,,"From 2010 to 2020, Google signed more than 55 power purchase agreements totaling nearly 6 gigawatts of renewable energy that is new to the grid, representing a commitment of approximately $4 billion through 2034.",,,,,,
,,These deals have resulted in over $7 billion in investments in renewable energy 2 Google European Union NFRD Report 20222projects across the globe.,,,,,,
,,We have agreements in place to purchase energy from four continents.,,,,,,
,,"In 2020, building on what we’d learned and due to the transformation underway in the global energy system, we set a new goal: By 2030 we aim to run our business on carbon-free energy everywhere, at all times.",,,,,,
,,"To achieve this, we will need to evolve from matching our annual energy consumption with renewable energy to sourcing carbon-free energy every hour of every day.",,,,,,
,,"In 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030.",,,,,,
,,We aim to reduce the majority of our emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030 and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.,,,,,,
,,"Google’s data centers are the heart of our company, powering products like Search, Gmail, and YouTube for billions of people around the world, 24/7.",,,,,,
,,"As part of our climate-related risk assessment, we identified that an example of a potential technology-related risk could be maintaining the environmental performance of data centers as demand for digital products, and the amount of computing power needed to run these applications, increases dramatically.",,,,,,
,,"However, we’ve worked for more than a decade to make Google data centers some of the most efficient in the world and have striven to improve their environmental performance even as demand for our products has dramatically risen.",,,,,,
,,"On average, a Google data center is twice as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center.",,,,,,
,,"In 2021, the average annual PUE (power usage effectiveness) for our global fleet of data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.57—meaning that Google data centers use about six times less overhead energy for every unit of IT equipment energy.",,,,,,
,,"At Google, just as we focus on users in designing our products, we focus on our employees in creating healthy workplaces, from our San Francisco Bay Area headquarters to Google offices at diverse sites in more than 180 cities around the world.",,,,,,
,,"At the end of 2020, over 1.5 million square meters (17 million square feet) of Google office facilities had achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification.",,,,,,
,,"We take a science- and community-driven approach to managing land use on our campuses, aiming to positively impact the places where we operate by designing and building our offices with local ecology and landscape resilience in mind.",,,,,,
,,"For example, we’ve developed science-based Habitat Design Guidelines, which we apply to our Bay Area campus design process.",,,,,,
,,"By the end of 2020, we’d implemented these guidelines across our headquarters, resulting in the planting of nearly 2,200 new native trees and the creation of over a dozen acres of new site-appropriate habitat.",,,,,,
,,"3 Google European Union NFRD Report 20223To accelerate the transition to a circular economy , we’re working to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same.",,,,,,
,,One such project is a software system that we use in our kitchens to track and reduce pre- consumer food waste.,,,,,,
,,This data-driven optimization has helped Google prevent nearly 4.4 million kilograms (9.7 million pounds) of pre-consumer food waste since 2014.,,,,,,
,,"To protect our planet and keep it healthy, we need to collectively cut back on food waste—for us at Google, that means doubling down on our efforts to reduce waste in our kitchens and cafes.",,,,,,
,,"By 2025, we aim to cut food waste in half for each Googler and send zero food waste to the landfill.",,,,,,
,,We also put Google technology to work helping others study and respond to environmental challenges.,,,,,,
,,"We’re working with numerous research and nonprofit organizations to map the world’s forests, oceans, watersheds, and air quality, then helping to get that information into the hands of decision- makers.",,,,,,

,,,,,,,,1 Google Environmental Report 2021Our approach We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet.
,,,,,,,,"Sustainability is one of our core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do."
,,,,,,,,We’ve been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Google’s founding over 20 years ago.
,,,,,,,,These are some of our key achievements over the past two decades: 2007: We became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.
,,,,,,,,"2017: We became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable energy, which we’ve achieved for four consecutive years ."
,,,,,,,,2020: We issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds —the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history.
,,,,,,,,"2020: We compensated for our legacy carbon footprint, making Google the first major company to be carbon neutral for its entire operating history."
,,,,,,,,"Our five-year sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate (see Figure 1)."
,,,,,,,,"Figure 1 FIVE-YEAR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY OVERVIEW We strive to build sustainability into everything we do Empower with technology Tackle major sustainability problems and drive net-positive impact using Google technologies, platforms, products, and servicesAccelerate carbon-free and circular Decouple business growth from the growth of carbon intensity and material use Benefit people and places Share benefits with the communities of our facilities, users, partners, and suppliers 2 Google Environmental Report 2021To accelerate the transition to a carbon-free economy, in 2020, we launched our third decade of climate action , and we’re now working toward a new set of ambitious commitments."
,,,,,,,,"By 2030, we aim to: Achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain Become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year Enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions Help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually To accelerate the transition to a circular economy, we’re working to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same."
,,,,,,,,We’re also working to empower everyone with technology by committing to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by 2022 through our core products.
,,,,,,,,"To benefit the people and places where we operate, we’ve set goals to replenish more water than we consume by 2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate."
,,,,,,,,"We’ll focus on three areas: enhancing our stewardship of water resources across Google office campuses and data centers; replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress."
,,,,,,,,"At Google, we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability , and we’ll continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our planet."
,,,,,,,,"We’re proud of what we’ve achieved so far, and we’re energized to help move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all."
,,,,,,,,3 Google Environmental Report 2021Performance highlights The following section provides a snapshot of our performance as of the end of 2020—demonstrating how we’re strengthening our business by reducing the environmental impact of our operations and working to empower people everywhere to live more sustainably.

,,,,,,,,"GHG emissions are calculated according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) , developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)."
,,,,,,,,"For more information on our methodology, including a breakdown of Scope 3 categories, see Alphabet’s 2021 CDP Climate Change Response ."
,,,,,,,,20.
,,,,,,,,"Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources we own or over which we have operational control, such as company vehicles or generators at Google’s offices and data centers."
,,,,,,,,Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the production of electricity we purchase to run our operations and the production of space heating for our offices.
,,,,,,,,"The location-based category reflects the average carbon intensity of the electric grids where our operations are located and, thus, where our energy consumption occurs."
,,,,,,,,"The market-based category incorporates our procurement choices, i.e., our renewable energy purchases via contractual mechanisms like PPAs."
,,,,,,,,"Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our value chain, such as business travel or our suppliers."
,,,,,,,,21.
,,,,,,,,"CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability of a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years)."
,,,,,,,,"Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP."
,,,,,,,,Carbon dioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.
,,,,,,,,22.
,,,,,,,,"Since 2010, we’ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall emissions."
,,,,,,,,"Until 2015, there was no guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity procured against electricity consumed (in megawatt-hours) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project."
,,,,,,,,"In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol released new Scope 2 guidance for the accounting of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data."
,,,,,,,,"Our pre-2015 methodology differed from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s in that we did not use residual mixes, which avoid double-counting of claimed renewable energy attributes."
,,,,,,,,23.
,,,,,,,,See note 19 above.
,,,,,,,,24.
,,,,,,,,"In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food served in our offices, hardware manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products."
,,,,,,,,"Google’s hardware includes data center servers, networking equipment, and consumer hardware products."
,,,,,,,,These extended categories have been reported annually from 2018 onward.
,,,,,,,,25.
,,,,,,,,"We’ve restated our 2018 Scope 3 (other) emissions due to changes in our calculation methodology and improvements in data quality, resulting in a corresponding restatement of our 2018 Scope 3 (total) and 2018 Total (Scope 1, 2 [market-based], and 3 [total]) emissions."
,,,,,,,,26.
,,,,,,,,"In 2020, due to the global pandemic, we began to estimate and report on our emissions associated with teleworking (i.e., employees working remotely)."
,,,,,,,,We applied the estimation methodology outlined in EcoAct’s Homeworking Emissions Whitepaper to our annual average workforce in 2020 to estimate the GHG emissions generated by employees working remotely from their homes.
,,,,,,,,"Teleworking emissions are reported as part of our Scope 3 emissions for employee commuting, per Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0)."
,,,,,,,,"For a breakdown of our operational Scope 3 emissions by category, see our 2020 Independent Accountants’ Review Report ."
,,,,,,,,27.
,,,,,,,,"In 2020, we began reporting teleworking emissions as part of our Scope 3 employee commuting emissions."
,,,,,,,,Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting) emissions reported prior to 2019 do not include teleworking emissions.

,,,,,,,,"In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment."
,,,,,,,,"For more information, see our 2017 white paper, 10 Years of Carbon Neutrality ."
,,,,,,,,"In 2020, we extended our operational emissions boundary to include teleworking emissions."
,,,,,,,,"The operational emissions included in our carbon neutrality commitment now include Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting, including teleworking)."
,,,,,,,,34.
,,,,,,,,"Emissions reduced by renewable energy PPAs are calculated by subtracting Scope 2 market-based method (MBM) GHG emissions from Scope 2 location-based method GHG emissions, thereby representing emissions reductions from renewable energy PPAs and MBM emission factors."
,,,,,,,,35.
,,,,,,,,See note 33 above.
,,,,,,,,36.
,,,,,,,,Carbon intensity metrics are based on gross global combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions.
,,,,,,,,37.
,,,,,,,,"In 2019, we updated our megawatt-hour carbon intensity metric to include all of our gross Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions divided by our total energy consumption, rather than limiting this intensity figure to our data centers."
,,,,,,,,38.
,,,,,,,,"Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable and non-renewable sources."
,,,,,,,,39.
,,,,,,,,"Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations (i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) with the total volume of electricity consumed by our operations."
,,,,,,,,"This metric includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed."
,,,,,,,,"Prior to 2016, we were not accounting for the renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity."
,,,,,,,,40.
,,,,,,,,The Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Scope 2 Guidance requires energy attribute certificates to be sourced from and applied to the same market in which the reporting entity’s electricity- consuming operations are located.
,,,,,,,,This guidance does not recognize existing renewable energy on the electric grids where an entity’s operations are located.
,,,,,,,,41.
,,,,,,,,Our carbon-free energy (CFE) percentage measures the degree to which our electricity consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis.
,,,,,,,,This is calculated using both CFE under contract by Google as well as CFE coming from the overall grid mix.
,,,,,,,,"For more information, see our 2021 white paper, 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy: Methodologies and Metrics ."
,,,,,,,,42.
,,,,,,,,We’ve revised total waste generated for 2019 due to a calculation error.
,,,,,,,,"This correction resulted in a decrease in total waste generated for 2019 from 51,617 metric tons to 48,216 metric tons."
,,,,,,,,43.
,,,,,,,,Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery.
,,,,,,,,44.
,,,,,,,,"In 2020, pre-consumer food waste prevented in our cafés was tracked only from January to March due to limited café operations during the global pandemic."
,,,,,,,,45.
,,,,,,,,"In 2019, we aligned our water reporting with industry standards to disclose three water indicators: total water withdrawal, as well as consumption and discharge."
,,,,,,,,46.
,,,,,,,,"In 2016, 2017, and 2018, water withdrawal was reported as water consumption."
,,,,,,,,"Beginning in 2019, we restated the 2016, 2017, and 2018 values as water withdrawal."
,,,,,,,,47.
,,,,,,,,2019 was the first year we disclosed gross global water consumption and gross global water discharge data; data for these indicators is not available for prior years.
,,,,,,,,48.
,,,,,,,,See note 47 above.

,,,,,,,,We began installing EV charging ports in Canada in 2017.
,,,,,,,,51.
,,,,,,,,Emissions avoided are estimated using data from the reported ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada only.
,,,,,,,,52.
,,,,,,,,"While Google’s total number of installed EV charging ports in the United States and Canada increased in 2020, the ports experienced limited use from March to December due to the global pandemic, resulting in a decrease in emissions avoided due to employee EV commuting."
