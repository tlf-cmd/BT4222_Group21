This new 2020 goal includes approximately $50 billion toward green initiatives that will also fulfill our 2017 clean financing target.,,,,
"We established a new goal in 2020 because we were already nearly three-quarters of the way toward our 2025 clean financing target —and because the environmental, social and economic needs the world is facing require us to think bigger.",,,,
"Effectively tackling critical global challenges like climate change requires addressing the full spectrum of development needs, as reflected in the SDGs.",,,,

Our firm has served as a member of TCFD since it was established.,,,,
Our report discusses our approach toward managing climate-related risks and how we are capitalizing on the opportunities that arise through a transition to a lower-carbon economy.,,,,
"Since our report was published, we have taken a number of steps to integrate climate factors into our firmwide processes for identifying, assessing and managing risks.",,,,
For example: ~We created a dedicated risk team focused on climate.,,,,

"This includes working to expand our efforts to more communities that are vulnerable, as well as better aligning our community resilience strategy with immediate disaster relief efforts.",,,,
Operational Sustainability Minimizing the environmental impact of our physical operations continues to be an important part of our global sustainability strategy.,,,,
It also helps us to reduce costs and strengthen the firm’s resilience.,,,,
"Given the nature of our business, our direct environmental impacts stem primarily from the operation of more than 5,400 corporate buildings, retail bank branches and data centers, including the electricity needed to power those sites.",,,,
Increasing Renewable Energy Increasing our support for renewable energy is a core part of our operational sustainability strategy.,,,,

JPMorgan Chase Corporate Responsibility Report / www.jpmorganchase.com/cr1 Return on Community: A Business Imperative We live in a time when it is easy to feel that there is more that divides us than unites us.",,,
,"Economic, racial and cultural fault lines, it seems, are only growing wider.",,,
,The disparity between those sharing in — and those locked out of — a growing economy is driving the wedge still deeper.,,,
,The typical American family has a lower net worth than its counterpart did 20 years ago.,,,
,"Meanwhile, for every $100 in white family wealth today, black families hold just about $5.",,,
,The system is failing too many people.,,,
,And the fractures this creates undermine the basic tenets of our society.,,,
,"In the midst of so much disparity, business has a fundamental responsibility to do much more to make the system work for more people.",,,
,"JPMorgan Chase is applying the capabilities and resources that have made us successful as a business to generate what we call ‘Return on Community.’ This means we are making intentional, strategic investments to lift those who are being left behind.",,,
,We are measuring our returns according to how we improve individual lives within communities.,,,
,"Number of jobs created, units of affordable housing created or preserved, small businesses launched and young people who’ve gained the skills needed for in-demand jobs are how we measure our results.",,,
,"We consider these results essential to the long-term success of our firm because when our communities do well, our company does well.",,,
,"So we are approaching these efforts like we do other aspects of our business by making long-term, data-driven investments; refining them as we learn what works; and rigorously evaluating our performance using metrics like ratio of investments to outside capital leveraged.",,,
,"We are maximizing our impact by focusing where we can best apply our firm’s resources and capabilities to drive inclusive growth: building job skills, expanding small businesses, revitalizing neighborhoods and promoting financial health.",,,
,As we have demonstrated in Detroit — where we have refined our model over the last several years — this approach works.,,,
,People are moving back to the city.,,,
,The unemployment rate is down from 20 percent in 2013 to less than 9 percent.,,,
,"For the first time in 17 years, home values have risen and mortgage lending is up.",,,
,"While much work remains to be done, there is a sense of optimism once again, particularly among young people who now see a future for themselves in their city.",,,
,So what does Return on Community look like in practice?,,,
,"It looks like Detroit Vegan Soul, a restaurant in Detroit’s West Village.",,,
,"With financing from the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, co-owners Kirsten Ussery and Erica Boyd recently opened their second location in Grandmont Rosedale — the first sit-down restaurant to open in that neighborhood in nearly a decade.",,,
,"They now employ 25 people in Detroit, and have their sights set on expanding throughout Michigan.",,,
,"JPMorgan Chase helped launch the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund to provide much-needed capital to underserved entrepreneurs — or, more precisely, to invest in people like Ussery and Boyd who are having extraordinary multiplier effects in our communities.",,,
,"We are now replicating this successful approach with similar funds in Chicago, San Francisco, the South Bronx and the Greater Washington region.",,,
,"In 2018, we took an even bigger step to take our model to scale with the launch of Advancing Cities, a five-year, $500 million initiative through which we are combining our business and philanthropic capital to create greater economic opportunity in communities around the world.",,,
,These efforts reflect the degree to which the mission to expand economic opportunity has become a fundamental part of the culture of JPMorgan Chase.,,,
,We believe there is both a clear economic imperative and moral obligation to do our part to help mend the social fabric in our communities.,,,
,"Peter L. Scher, Head of Corporate Responsibility and Chairman of the Mid-Atlantic Region, JPMorgan Chase & Co.",,,
,"The Opportunity Long Game by Jamie Dimon , Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co. INTRODUCTION ADVANCING CITIES PILLARS 7 TRAITS The Opportunity Long Game The trend line of human progress is unequivocally to the good, yet we still face serious challenges and deep divisions.",,,
,"People are disconnected from economic growth, and inequality has increased.",,,
,"For the first time in generations, life expectancy in the U.S. has reversed course, fueled by the opioid crisis and rising suicide rates.",,,
,These indicators should set alarm bells ringing not just in the halls of government and neighborhood meeting spots.,,,
,They should be ringing in corporate boardrooms as well.,,,
,Business cannot succeed in the face of challenges in our communities.,,,
,"On the contrary, long-term business success depends on community success.",,,
,"When everyone has a fair shot at participating in and sharing in the rewards of growth, the economy will be stronger and society more cohesive.",,,
,Making this happen requires business leaders to buck short-termism that too often drives the markets.,,,
,"Instead, we must take the long view.",,,
,I’ve always made clear that the value our firm generates for our shareholders reflects decisions and investments made over years — not quarters — and in consideration of a broad set of factors.,,,
,"“ Rising Sons,” a mural by The Fellowship Initiative’s 2018 Chicago class.",,,
,The Fellowship Initiative is JPMorgan Chase’s mentorship program that provides intensive academic and leadership training to help young men of color from economically distressed communities complete their high school educations and better prepare them to excel in colleges and universities.,,,
,"JPMorgan Chase Corporate Responsibility Report / www.jpmorganchase.com/cr3 The same holds for creating value for society, which requires thinking and acting on a time horizon of years, not months.",,,
,"By putting our capital and expertise to work to support our people, communities and customers, that’s exactly what JPMorgan Chase is doing.",,,
,"Just as we do in our business, we are analyzing the long-term challenges and trends, bringing the best experts — including many of our talented employees — to the table and using data to develop solutions.",,,
,"We are making significant, multiyear investments, focused where we have the skills and insights to make a real contribution.",,,
,"We are also testing and seeding new approaches — like extending low-cost loans to entrepreneurs or neighborhoods that struggle to access traditional financing on their own — and if those don’t work, we learn, adjust and try again.",,,
,"For example, data shows that black Americans face a disproportionate opportunity gap when it comes to accessing the resources that can help them get on the path to great careers, build wealth, grow a business and participate in the benefits of a growing economy.",,,
,"We recognize that our firm is uniquely positioned to marshal our resources, expertise and core business to help put economic opportunity in reach for more black Americans.",,,
,"So, in early 2019, we launched Advancing Black Pathways, which builds on and accelerates our existing efforts to help black people chart stronger paths to economic success.",,,
,"Through the initiative, we are leveraging our firm’s unrivaled insights into the financial lives of Americans to strengthen the financial wellness of black families, expand access to capital for black-owned small businesses and support black homeownership.",,,
,"We are increasing access to better educational and training opportunities for black students, including committing to hire more than 4,000 black students over the next five years into apprenticeships, internships and post-graduation roles.",,,
,"And we are expanding on our long-standing efforts to recruit, develop and promote black talent within our firm.",,,
,"This initiative reflects JPMorgan Chase’s approach to supporting our people, communities and customers: We bring the full force of our firm.",,,
,"Our nation -wide market e xpansion effort, through which we are opening 400 new Chase branches, offers another prime example.",,,
,"The new branches will enable us to better serve our customers, offer more good jobs and deliver on expanded lending and philanthropic commitments in our communities.",,,
,"We will add as many as 3,000 new jobs across the country, while we have raised wages for our U.S. hourly employees, many of whom work in our branches.",,,
,All of our efforts are grounded in the belief that the road to prosperity is paved with shared success.,,,
,"Across these efforts, we have seen that a long- term, strategic approach — combined with the right partners and informed by good data — yields real results.",,,
,"We know business alone cannot solve today’s biggest challenges, but we believe firmly we must step up and work with government and community leaders to offer solutions.",,,
,"The private sector has tremendous capacity to expand opportunity for those who need it most, and it’s a role and responsibility we should embrace.",,,
,"When we play the opportunity long game, we all win.",,,
,"Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.AdvancingCities Expanding Opportunity Through AdvancingCities by Irene Baker, Head of Advancing Cities, JPMorgan Chase & Co. INTRODUCTION ADVANCING CITIES PILLARS 7 TRAITSExpanding Opportunity Through Advancing Cities By Irene Baker , Head of AdvancingCities, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Five years ago in Detroit, JPMorgan Chase set out to test a new model for how businesses can play a greater role in improving the lives of people in the communities they serve.",,,
,"Our strategy was to focus on key drivers of inclusive growth where we could directly leverage our core business expertise, making data-driven investments where we could genuinely move the needle.",,,
,"The initial results in Detroit far exceeded our expectations — small businesses were launched, Detroiters secured training and landed good jobs, and new commercial space and housing in neighborhoods were developed.",,,
,"As a result, we not only expanded our commitment in Detroit but also put our model for impact into motion in Chicago, the Greater Washington region and Greater Paris.",,,
,"With AdvancingCities, we are doubling down on our commitment to drive inclusive growth and are dramatically expanding the number of people and places we reach.",,,
,AdvancingCities reflects valuable insights we have gained along the way.,,,
,"For example, we have seen the critical need to fill the gap between philanthropic and market-rate capital, which is why up to half of our $500 million commitment is earmarked as low -c ost, long-term loan capital.",,,
,"We have witnessed the power of competition to drive results, so the AdvancingCities Challenge invites communities to compete for funding to accelerate solutions that create more economic opportunity for their residents.",,,
,"Finally, we have found that our firm can be a powerful vehicle for attracting additional investment.",,,
,"Based on our experience, we expect AdvancingCities to leverage an additional $1 billion in outside capital to invest in communities around the world.",,,
,AdvancingCities is JPMorgan Chase’s largest and most ambitious corporate responsibility effort yet.,,,
,"I am thrilled to be leading this initiative, and to be part of a company that believes business has a responsibility to help solve real challenges in our communities.",,,
,"Advancing Cities is JPMorgan Chase’s $500 million, five -year initiative to drive inclusive growth in cities around the world.",,,
,"Through this groundbreaking effort, launched in September 2018, we are combining our philanthropic and business capital to expand opportunity for those who are being left behind in today’s economy.",,,
,"AdvancingCities deploys investments and encourages innovative solutions in two ways: Signature CitiesWe are making large-scale investments in cities around the world where the conditions are right for success and broader, deeper investments are needed to drive inclusive growth, most recently Greater Paris.",,,
,"This model applies insights from our work in Detroit, Chicago and the Greater Washington region.AdvancingCities ChallengeThe Challenge is a competition to source and seed creative, collaborative and sustainable solutions that address cross- cutting challenges to help more people benefit from a growing economy.",,,

,INTRODUCTION ADVANCING CITIES PILLARS 7 TRAITSSeeding Innovation and Amplifying Impact The Advancing Cities Challenge Competition sparks novel solutions and encourages diverse stakeholders to join forces around a shared goal.,,,
,We have seen this effect firsthand through competitions that are the hallmark of our Partnerships for Raising Opportunity in Neighborhoods (PRO Neighborhoods) initiative and the Financial Solutions Lab — and it’s the driver behind the Advancing Cities Challenge.,,,
,"Through the Challenge, we are inviting cities to compete for up to $3 million in each city to support innovative, sustainable solutions that help more people benefit from a growing economy.",,,
,"These ideas must offer unique ways to advance at least two of the four pillars that are at the heart of JPMorgan Chase’s model for impact: jobs and skills, small business expansion, neighborhood revitalization and financial health.",,,
,"And they must demonstrate a collaborative approach that brings together the public, private and nonprofit sectors — an approach that is essential to solving complex challenges.",,,

,"Our experience has shown that flexible capital, which can help bridge the gap between philanthropic and market-rate capital, is a key tool to attract additional investment and help more people share in the rewards of a growing economy.",,,
,"In Detroit, for example, the $40 million in low-cost loan capital we provided was leveraged by partner organizations to attract more than $233 million from outside investors.",,,
,The use of flexible lending capital creates a sustainable solution to fill unmet financing needs and help critical community projects — which often lack access to traditional financing — get off the ground.,,,
,"It also means that once the loans have been repaid, JPMorgan Chase and our partners can recycle and redeploy the capital back into the community, further amplifying our impact.",,,
,"In December 2018, we committed $10 million in low-cost, long-term capital to the Chicago Community Loan Fund, our first flexible capital commitment as part of Advancing Cities.",,,
,This low-cost loan will support the development and preservation of small businesses and commercial corridors on Chicago’s South and West sides.,,,
,JPMorgan Chase Institute research found that residents in these areas must travel greater distances to access everyday goods and services.,,,
,"The new low-cost, long-term capital will fill a critical need to strengthen and expand the area’s small business sector, while also spurring local job creation.",,,
,"JPMorgan Chase supports our clients not just by providing the banking solutions they need, but by delivering the full force and capabilities of our firm.",,,
,We take the same approach where we live and work.,,,

,Here are excerpts from the conversation.,,,
,What are the biggest challenges facing cities today?,,,
,"AS: Clearly, inclusive economic development is the challenge of our generation.",,,
,"To me, there’s no other headline that we need to be focused on in cities.",,,
,"For a place like Fresno, the question is how to get your arms around all the ways to create opportunity, and ultimately connect that to the residents who need it most.",,,
,"MN: Unequal access to opportunity, and the lack of resources to address it.",,,
,"Philadelphia is number one in a bunch of things, but unfortunately, we have the highest poverty rate of the 10 largest cities in the United States.",,,
,"We have educational challenges, homelessness and a variety of issues, and you never have enough resources.",,,
,"But cities are resilient and, more importantly, our citizens are resilient.",,,
,What are the keys to solving these challenges?,,,
,MD: Public-private partnerships are so important.,,,
,Government can’t do it by itself.,,,
,The Entrepreneurs of Color Fund is a great example.,,,
,"With the fund’s help, we just celebrated the opening of the first sit-do wn restaurant in Jefferson-Chalmers in 30 years.",,,
,"It’s got African American ownership, in a formerly vacant storefront, in a neighborhood miles from downtown.",,,
,This is the kind of inclusive development you can do with public-private partnerships.,,,
,AS: Collaboration is absolutely key.,,,
,It maximizes resources and improves outcomes.,,,
,"You see communities where leaders are willing to cross boundaries — political, geographic, whatever they are.",,,
,That’s a good sign of a community that’s hungry for change.,,,
,What’s your advice on successfully leading change in a city?,,,
,MD: Take the drama out of it.,,,
,"We have enormous buy-in from the community because folks know that if they come in, they’re not getting an “us versus them” situation.",,,
,"If you have your community unified, you’re going to be successful.",,,
,MN: Have a plan and do it all in a transparent way.,,,
,"People can see what’s going on, and you’re not going to make everyone happy.",,,
,"But you have to have a vision for where you’re trying to go, provide leadership and take people with you.",,,
,"Greater Paris INTRODUCTION ADVANCING CITIES PILLARS 7 TRAITS Investing in Opportunity Greater Paris With its stunning architecture, charming squares and rich history, Paris is truly a “city of cities.” But like many major cities around the world with vibrant centers of commerce, there is more to Paris than meets the eye.",,,
,"While the city center shines brightly, 1.5 million people in Greater Paris live with poverty, unemployment and homelessness.",,,
,"In France, 5.3 million people — 8 percent of the total population — have an income of €12,000 or less, which is about $14,000 or less.",,,
,"It is undeniably clear that too many people in areas across Île-de-France, particularly in Seine-Saint-Denis, have been shut out of a growing global economy.",,,
,"In 2018, JPMorgan Chase made a $30 million, five- year philanthropic investment to provide underserved residents and local entrepreneurs across Greater Paris access to greater economic opportunity.",,,
,This doubles the firm’s philanthropic investments in the Greater Paris area and is the first commitment as part of our new AdvancingCities initiative.,,,
,"We are applying insights from our work in U.S. cities and our history in Paris, and using our firm’s proven model for impact, to break down barriers in Greater Paris.",,,
,"In addition, our firm’s deep nonprofit and government partnerships and experiences on the ground in Paris are guiding where and how we invest.",,,
,We are also drawing on the experiences of our Paris Service Corps teams.,,,
,"As we’ve done in Detroit, Chicago and the Greater Washington region, JPMorgan Chase is focusing on the key pillars of opportunity that lift up underserved populations and offer the promise of more inclusive growth in Greater Paris.",,,
,"Specifically, we are building on economic development activity currently underway and upcoming major infrastructure projects — such as the Paris Olympic Games in 2024 and Grand Paris Express — to create more widely shared prosperity.",,,
,"With our investments in Paris, our goal is to become a catalyst for change and a model for what other corporations could do.",,,

,"Today, Greater Paris faces serious challenges, including people disconnected and not benefiting from economic growth.",,,
,We have been working a long time to address these challenges.,,,
,"For example, over the past five years, through our philanthropic investments, we have supported over 1,200 micro and small businesses, helped create more than 2,300 jobs and provided over 2,500 young and long-term unemployed adults with technical training, job skills programs and mentorship.",,,

,"EMPLOYEES MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON THE GROUND Our firm’s new commitment in Greater Paris was greatly informed by the work of our Service Corps, which sends teams of our top performing employees from around the world to put their skills and expertise to work on behalf of our nonprofit partners.",,,
,"In early 2018, Service Corps teams went to Greater Paris for the first time to help our nonprofit partners strengthen their organizations and maximize the impact of our future philanthropic investments.",,,

,"With forward-thinking strategies focused on inclusion and opportunity, successful cities are creating more diverse and vibrant places where people want to live, work and play.",,,
,"FRESNO, CALIFORNIA When city leaders learned that Fresno had been ranked as the city in America with the highest level of concentrated poverty, they were devastated.",,,
,"This dubious ranking, along with other data that showed Fresno’s poverty levels were on par with those of the poorest regions of the country, confirmed what those living in distressed areas already knew too well: Too many people in Fresno, particularly those in historic and core neighborhoods, were left behind.",,,
,"Instead of giving up, the city stepped up.",,,
,City leaders coalesced around a new sense of purpose — to urgently change course by charting an intentional path that would lead to more inclusive growth.,,,
,"In 2010, city officials, under then Mayor Ashley Swearengin’s leadership, decided to tackle the entrenched conditions that had led to rampant poverty and unemployment, such as bad land-use policy and urban sprawl.",,,
,"The intentional approach featured two years of community engagement to uncover challenges and identify practical, community -based solutions.",,,
,It also created partnerships and provided education and resources for low -income r esidents to stay informed and connected about the changes affecting their community.,,,
,This deliberate approach led to substantial results.,,,
,"In 2014, the city enacted policies that included an updated general plan and development code, which created Fresno’s first mixed-use zoning districts along the city’s major transit corridors and focused development inward with an eye toward renewing underserved neighborhoods.",,,
,"Today, the city continues to focus on enacting good policy, engaging its residents, investing in and revitalizing civic infrastructure and a range of other strategies aimed at ensuring Fresno’s development benefits all its residents.",,,
,"Through JPMorgan Chase’s PRO Neighborhoods competition, the firm is supporting efforts that build on the city’s thoughtful plan for inclusive growth.",,,
,"In 2018, the firm made a philanthropic investment in a collaborative — centered around Central Valley Community Foundation, Access Plus Capital, The Northern California Community Loan Fund and Opportunity Fund — that supports loans and technical assistance for residents, business owners and property owners to build wealth, improve homes and spur economic activity in Fresno’s most underserved neighborhoods.",,,

,Sometimes the best way to tackle them is to start small.,,,

,"Doing so requires that solving the problem, however small, aligns with a city’s strategy for economic growth — and lays the foundation for addressing larger, more complex issues.",,,

,"Unfortunately, underserved communities are often most affected by these disasters, and they are unable to recover quickly.",,,
,"And storms leave lasting damage in their wake, both physical and economic.",,,
,"For example, the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that in Miami, Hurricane Irma disrupted family health care spending and debt payments, which both dropped and had still not recovered to baseline levels more than two months after the storm.",,,
,South Florida is taking small steps that add up to the big system-wide changes needed so that everyone is better prepared when disaster strikes.,,,
,These steps include working with small businesses to prepare in the event their cash flow is disrupted after a natural disaster and researching building codes and flood zone regulations that could affect housing affordability.,,,
,JPMorgan Chase has invested in a number of programs in South Florida that tackle important parts of the larger challenges caused by extreme weather.,,,
,"For example, the firm is supporting Catalyst Miami’s efforts to establish women-owned worker cooperatives.",,,
,"Cooperatives will add an economic development layer to Catalyst’s “resilience hubs” initiative, which helps residents in low-income neighborhoods with basic needs in times of crisis, such as a hurricane.",,,
,"Cooperatives provide employment, job stability and higher wages, and keep capital within a community — all important features of community-level resilience.",,,

,"For example, the Index is now being used in London’s Heath Ward — one of 17 wards that make up the borough of Barking and Dagenham — to give leaders a more accurate understanding of residents’ needs, including levels of household debt.",,,
,"The Prosperity Index has also led to the development of a unique ward-level index on social progress, which is being used to understand the well-being of residents and drive resource allocation decisions.",,,

,,"The challenge we face today is twofold: We need to find ways to continue to generate energy for the world’s growing needs, including transportation, electricity and heating for homes and offices, and powering industry and manufacturing.",,
,,And we need to do so by using lower-carbon technologies so that the world can meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.,,
,,"Currently there are not adequate, commercially available low- carbon energy solutions for all of the world’s energy needs.",,
,,"Technologies like wind and solar have made huge strides, but they are principally deployed for electricity generation.",,
,,"Overall, renewable energy accounts for only about 28% of global electricity generation.",,
,,"13 And, even as this scales up, electricity generation still accounts for only about 44% of global carbon dioxide emissions.",,
,,"14 Particularly in harder-to-abate sectors such as industrial, manufacturing and heavy transportation (e.g., trucking and air travel) — which support basic economic needs around the globe — many of the technology alternatives that exist today are not yet scalable or cost-effective.",,
,,"As a result, even as additional low-carbon technologies are developed and deployed over time, resources like oil and natural gas will continue to play a role in meeting essential global energy needs.",,
,,Industries that produce and consume these resources cannot be abandoned completely.,,
,,"Therefore, companies that produce and consume these resources will need to invest in significant and continuous performance improvements to help meet the Paris Agreement goals.",,
,,"Clearly these are daunting challenges, which will require meaningful efforts across the public and private sectors.",,
,,"Significant changes in government policy and the creation of new technologies will ultimately be required to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement, particularly in those industrialized sectors that today lack alternatives.",,
,,"To that end, our firm continues to actively support market-based policy solutions, including a price on carbon (see page 57) and the commercialization of new technologies that can help advance deep decarbonization.",,
,,"While our firm — or even the financial sector as a whole — cannot solve these challenges alone, we have an important role to play.",,
,,It is estimated that up to $150 trillion will be needed globally over the next 30 years to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals.,,
,,"15 This means that, for companies to succeed through energy transition — that is, become more efficient, innovate, evolve and stay competitive in a changing world — they will need significant capital and strategic support.",,
,,"48 2020 Environmental, Social & Governance ReportAligning Our Financing with the Goals of the Paris Agreement In October 2020, JPMorgan Chase announced our commitment to align our financing portfolio with the goals of the Paris Agreement.",,
,,This means we are measuring the GHG emissions of our clients in key sectors of our financing portfolio (our “financed emissions”) and are setting reduction targets for these sector portfolios that are Paris-aligned.,,
,,"To start, we have developed intermediate Paris-aligned targets to reduce the carbon intensity in our Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing portfolios by 2030.",,
,,Why We Made This Commitment Our commitment to Paris-alignment is an important step toward accelerating the low-carbon energy transition and encouraging near-term actions that will set a path for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.,,
,,"By working directly with clients to develop and finance their transition strategies and goals, we will help them navigate the challenges and opportunities of decarbonization and the energy transition, while also helping accelerate new technologies and business strategies.",,
,,"Despite the many challenges, more and more companies are hard at work to align their business strategies to the goals of the Paris Agreement.",,
,,"As a global financial services firm, we do business with companies operating in a diverse array of industries, including many in the energy sector.",,
,,"We want to use our position to make an impact and help drive solutions, because encouraging these efforts is good for our clients, the economy, our business and ultimately the planet.",,
,,Our Paris-aligned financing commitment is the next step in our journey to mobilize our business to respond to our clients’ needs and help address climate change.,,
,,Our Approach to Paris-Alignment JPMorgan Chase has developed Carbon CompassSM — our methodology to measure and track progress against our Paris- aligned targets.,,
,,"Our methodology incorporates, but also expands on, existing external approaches to define robust, decision-useful metrics and science-based, Paris-aligned targets on a sector-by-sector basis.",,
,,"Our targets are based on credible third-party energy and emissions scenarios, such as the International Energy Agency’s Sustainable Development Scenario (IEA SDS) and the Energy Technology Perspectives Beyond 2°C Scenario (ETP B2DS), which include specific glide paths to achieve Paris-aligned emissions.We chose to initially focus on three sectors — Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing — for a few key reasons.",,
,,"First, these sectors are each responsible for a significant share of GHG emissions in the global energy value chain, making them key to bringing overall emissions trajectories in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.",,
,,"Second, viable transition pathways exist and many companies in these sectors are already pursuing them.",,
,,"Third, though improvements are needed, sufficient emissions data is emerging in each of these sectors.",,
,,"Finally, these sectors represent both the supply and demand side of the energy system, with oil and natural gas being key energy sources used by the power and automotive sectors.",,
,,"Therefore, the interplay between these sectors is important to overall decarbonization.",,
,,"For example, a lower-carbon power grid is a key enabler of decarbonization in the auto sector, as electric vehicles are only truly low- or zero-emission if charged by lower carbon or renewably powered electricity.",,
,,"By starting with these three sectors, we are increasing full value chain accountability for decarbonization.",,
,,"Over time, we will work to expand our methodology to encompass additional sectors and aim to extend and improve its application in accordance with best practices and improved data availability.",,
,,"In establishing our methodology, we enlisted the support of ERM — a global pure-play sustainability consultancy with deep sectoral, technical and business expertise in the low carbon and energy transition — to challenge and enhance our efforts.",,
,,We are making the details of our methodology public to help advance collective efforts across our industry and to bring our clients along on our journey to help meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.,,
,,See our Carbon Compass Methodology for more details on our overall process and sector-specific details.,,
,,"49 2020 Environmental, Social & Governance ReportCurrent Portfolio and 2030 Portfolio Targets The metrics in the table below summarize the financed emissions starting point of each of our sector portfolios (i.e., our portfolio baselines), as well as the 2030 targets we have defined for each sector, which are Paris-aligned.",,
,,"These metrics are measured as a weighted average carbon intensity of each portfolio, as further detailed in our methodology document.",,
,,"Sector 2019 Portfolio Baseline 2030 Portfolio Targets Oil & GasOperational (Scopes 1 and 2)6.1 g CO 2e/MJ-35% reduction from 2019 baseline End Use (Scope 3)66.5 g CO 2/MJ-15% reduction from 2019 baseline Electric Power (Scope 1)375.6 kg CO 2/MWh115.4 kg CO 2/MWh -69% reduction from 2019 baseline Auto Manufacturing(Scopes 1, 2 and 3)157.8 g CO 2e/km92.3 g CO 2e/km -41% reduction from 2019 baseline Moving forward, we will disclose our progress against our targets annually, as well as details of how we are implementing and refining our methodology over time.",,
,,"Highlights of Our Carbon CompassSM Methodology Our appr oach incorporates what we believe are the most relevant, impactful, credible and decision-useful data and metrics to drive progress.",,
,,"Below, we highlight some key choices and considerations that we made in the development of our methodology.",,
,,"Include the most relevant and impactful activities, emissions and financing.",,
,,"To be effective, we know the metrics we use and the emissions we measure must be based on activities that generate the most GHG emissions for each sector and that are most important for each company’s transition pathway.",,
,,"For example, in the Oil & Gas sector, we include both operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions from the production and refining of oil and gas, and end-use (Scope 3) emissions associated with the ultimate combustion of that oil and gas.",,
,,"We also include methane emissions in addition to carbon dioxide, because methane is a critical component of the overall global warming impact of the sector.",,
,,"Similarly, in the Auto sector we include U.S. light trucks in addition to global passenger cars, since most U.S. light trucks are used as passenger vehicles.",,
,,"For some companies, U.S. light trucks can constitute up to 30% of global passenger vehicle sales, making these vehicles material for overall emissions and for a company’s ability to transition to a lower-carbon fleet.",,
,,We also include our most relevant financing in these sectors.,,
,,Our approach includes both financing that we directly provide (such as through revolving credit facilities) as well as our share of facilitated financing (such as through our underwriting in debt and equity capital markets).,,
,,The vast majority of this activity occurs in our CIB and CB lines of business.,,
,,"50 2020 Environmental, Social & Governance ReportUse carbon intensity because it is the most decision-useful metric for our commitment.",,
,,"The primary metric we are currently using to measure company and our portfolio performance is carbon intensity, which expresses emissions relative to a given unit of output (e.g., kilograms of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour of electricity generation) rather than in absolute terms (e.g., just kilograms of carbon dioxide).",,
,,"Carbon intensity metrics will most effectively enable us to evaluate performance at the sector and the company levels, inform our engagement with our clients and make capital allocation decisions.",,
,,Evaluating these changes in performance is crucial in an economy that needs to meet the Paris objectives while still generating energy for the world’s growing needs.,,
,,"More specifically, carbon intensity is decision-useful and impact- oriented because it: ] Allows us to set informative targets that are aligned with science-based scenarios, which require constraining total emissions on a pathway that ultimately achieves net zero ] Enables us to meaningfully engage with new and existing clients and provide the capital necessary to help finance their transition, while reducing the carbon intensity of our portfolio ] Enables us to evaluate both individual companies’ and whole sectors’ performance against decarbonization trajectories that must be achieved to align with the Paris Agreement ] More effectively reflects the progress that high-emitting companies and sectors are making in transitioning to lower-carbon production and products ] Allows for easier comparison across a portfolio of companies within a sector and between companies of different sizes ] Is less affected than absolute emissions by year-to-year emissions volatility, such as changes in companies’ production ] Avoids attributing market volatility (e.g., changes in company value) to our measurement of a company’s emissions, which can result in incorrect signals about a client’s underlying emissions performance Base calculations on best available data — and advocate for better data.",,
,,"Our metrics are designed to make use of consistent, well-reported and standardized data.",,
,,"Where gaps do exist, we have established a detailed process for using the best available alternative data.",,
,,"However, more and better data is still needed.",,
,,"Beyond our three starting sectors in particular, measuring company emissions remains a significant challenge.",,
,,"Going forward, we will explore different ways to engage with industry on improving emissions data and aim to update our methodology to reflect improvements over time.How We Will Drive Progress Going forward, we intend to align our lending and underwriting decisions in our chosen sectors to work toward achieving our portfolio targets, which means we will work to increasingly support those companies that are helping advance the goals of the Paris Agreement, such as by expanding their investment in low- and zero-carbon energy sources and technologies and reducing their GHG emissions.",,
,,Measuring emissions performance metrics and stated targets will be a key factor in how we evaluate and make decisions about financing of clients in our chosen sectors.,,
,,"While our 2030 portfolio targets are primarily based on carbon intensity metrics, we will consider a variety of performance indicators in our financing decisions, such as our clients’ own transition-related forward-looking commitments, business strategies and capital planning.",,
,,"Our targets have been developed at the portfolio level, instead of the client level, to recognize the unique challenges that exist for each sector, subsector and even each company.",,
,,"We also recognize that — for both our clients and our own portfolios — the pathway of forward-looking targets is unlikely to be linear, as the trajectory of transition for most companies will be driven by factors such as moments of major technological breakthroughs.",,
,,"Significant amounts of capital and strategic advice will be needed to support companies through the global energy transition, and it is our objective to use our capital and expertise to encourage and help our clients make this transition.",,
,,We believe our biggest impact comes from engaging with clients in these industries to inform their str ategic and financial decisions.,,
,,Our new Center for Carbon Transition (CCT) is vital to this overall effort.,,
,,"We established the CCT to manage our Paris-aligned financing commitment and engage with clients on sustainability-focused financing, research and advisory solutions to help guide their long-term business strategies.",,
,,The CCT has accountability to senior leadership in our CIB and CB lines of business and will work in close partnership with teams across our business to drive achievement of our commitment.,,

,,,This includes working with clients to support the transition to a low-carbon economy and providing sustainable investing and financing solutions.,
,,,Supporting the Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy Climate change is one of the most critical challenges facing our planet and society.,
,,,"We are responding by minimizing the carbon footprint of our own physical operations (see page 17), and by leveraging our business to support and accelerate the global transition to a low-carbon economy.",
,,,"In recent years, many governments, businesses and NGOs have aligned around the collective ambition to reduce global emissions to net zero by 2050.",
,,,"However, the world is not on track to achieve this goal.",
,,,"Achieving net zero by 2050 requires transforming the global energy system, as well as making significant changes in how key goods and services are produced and delivered.",
,,,The financial sector will play a key role in facilitating the substantial investment of this transition.,
,,,"As a global financial institution, our strategy is focused on providing financing, strategic advice and investment services to help clients adapt to and thrive in a low-carbon economy.",
,,,OUR PATH TO NET-ZERO FINANCED EMISSIONS A key aspect of our low-carbon strategy is how we engage with our clients in carbon-intensive industries on their transition.,
,,,"In 2020, we pledged to align key sectors of our financing portfolio with the goals of the Paris Agreement.",
,,,"In May 2021, we became the first large U.S. bank to set 2030 targets – which we set as portfolio-level emissions intensity reduction targets for the Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing sectors – and published our Carbon Compass Methodology detailing our approach.",
,,,We also announced our plans to expand our targets to new sectors of our financing portfolio over time.,
,,,"In October 2021, we joined the NZBA, a group convened by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative which brings together a global network of banks committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050.",
,,,"While thoughtful policy, technology and behavioral advancements are all prerequisites in realizing our common goals around net zero emissions by 2050, we joined the NZBA because we support the ambition for greater climate action, the sharing of best practices and a collaborative approach between the public and private sectors to reach this goal.",
,,,"We may further address important details of these efforts as they develop over time, including where we believe practical considerations may constrain our work against the ambitions of the NZBA – such as the necessity of technological advancements, the evolution of consumer behavior, the need for thoughtful climate policies around the world, the challenge of balancing short-term targets with the need to facilitate an orderly and just transition, and other critical considerations such as legal and regulatory obligations.",
,,,Participating in industry initiatives will also support our efforts to develop targets for other sectors and engage with a growing number of clients who are aligning their strategies with widely-recognized and science-based emission reduction pathways.,
,,,"How We Are Implementing Our Targets Since setting our first portfolio-level emissions intensity reduction targets, we have focused on implementing them in the management of our Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing financing portfolios.",
,,,"As part of this, an assessment of our client's emissions and decarbonization plans is now factored into our decision-making while considering new transactions for in-scope clients in these sectors – for both lending and debt capital markets transactions.",
,,,"This assessment allows us to: 1) build in a view of our client's decarbonization trajectories during the decision-making process on a potential new transaction, as a factor in our usual approval processes, and 2) assess both our client's progress and in turn, our own progress towards our targets on an ongoing basis.",

,,,"Whether a client is working to transition their business model and operations to reduce emissions, or to develop and grow new technologies or solutions to help address the climate challenge, our objective is to use our capital and expertise to help them succeed.",
,,,"As we expand our capabilities, we are able to provide clients with increasingly diverse and innovative solutions, while helping to grow the market for green and sustainable financing.",
,,,"For example, in October 2021, we acted as Joint Placement Agent on a $1 billion equity placement to capitalize a new passenger EV subsidiary for Tata Motors.",
,,,"Recognizing the potential and capital needs of the passenger EV business, the transaction was designed to attract investors seeking exposure to this segment and enable Tata Motors to accelerate its plans.",
,,,"As another example, in June 2021 we acted as Active Bookrunner on a $1.5 billion green bond offering by NextEra Energy.",
,,,"NextEra owns and operates two businesses – Florida Power & Light, the largest utility in the U.S., and NextEra Energy Resources, the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar – which are working together toward a goal of reducing NextEra’s emissions 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline.",
,,,"The bond, proceeds of which will be used to support a portfolio of renewable energy generation and storage projects, uses a mechanism to encourage transparency and accountability, by providing a coupon step-up if the company fails to produce certification of allocation and impact within two years and 60 days of issuance.",
,,,"This work is further highlighted by the green objective of our Sustainable Development Target, which aims to finance and facilitate $1 trillion through the end of 2030 towards the deployment of solutions for cleaner sources of energy and supporting the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy.",

,,,,"To support clients, we established the Center for Carbon Transition, central - izing client access to financing, advisory and research solutions to help them make the low-carbon transition and thrive."
,,,,"Second, we need to scale investment massively in clean tech- nologies."
,,,,"As the International Energy Agency has emphasized, “huge leaps in clean energy innovation” are core to achieving net zero."
,,,,"This is because the world will rely on traditional fuels until alternatives, like clean hydrogen, are fully available."
,,,,"To accelerate progress, JPMorgan Chase set a target to finance and facilitate $2.5 trillion over ten years to advance sustainable development, including $1 trillion for climate action and other green initiatives — with approximately $106 billion green activities financed in 2021."
,,,,"Third, while businesses have important roles to play in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy, the private sector cannot do this alone."
,,,,"Public sector leadership is needed to enact policies that spur long-term and large-scale capital deployment for low-carbon solutions that benefit the global economy, including measures like promoting investment in technology R&D and re-ductions in permitting timelines for energy infrastructure, such as wind and solar farms, transmission lines and liquefied natural gas."
,,,,"Finally, let’s set meaningful goals and identify a few tangible, cost-effective solutions to reduce emissions today."
,,,,This should include minimizing fugitive methane emissions and virtually eliminating wasteful flaring of natural gas.
,,,,"Immediately actionable opportunities like these might require more financing, not less, to prepare companies to thrive in a lower-carbon future."
,,,,"In 2021, JPMorgan Chase set 2030 targets to reduce the carbon intensity of our financing portfolio, starting with Oil & Gas, Electric Power, and Automotive Manufacturing — and now we are establishing three new sectoral goals for Iron & Steel, Cement and Aviation."
,,,,"It’s worth noting that while we make our own decisions for our company, we may work with coalitions or join organizations that seek to advance progress."
,,,,"Introduction At the end of the day, our climate ambitions are subject to important prerequisites and considerations, both within and outside of our control, including energy security, investment in innovation, appropriate climate policy, and our own views about orderly transition."
,,,,"It is in this context that we are pleased to present our 2022 Climate Report, which outlines the measures we are taking to respond to the climate challenge across our business."
,,,,"We remain committed to addressing energy and climate challenges as part of how we do business and serve our customers, clients, shareholders, and communities each day."
,,,,There is no silver bullet to meet the world’s energy and climate goals.
,,,,"But we can start by prioritizing emissions reductions, developing meaningful short- and long-term goals and crafting innovative policy solutions."
,,,,The curve toward net zero can still be bent before it’s too late.
,,,,"Jamie Dimon Chairman & CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co.As I said in my annual letter to shareholders last April, despite the growth in well-intended climate pledges from governments and companies, the world is well short of meeting its net-zero emissions goals by 2050."
,,,,"At the same time, resource scarcity is leading to higher energy costs and reduced reliability, hindering national security and hurting the most vulnerable."
,,,,"Disruptions to the global energy system are again highlighting our urgent, global need to provide energy resources securely, reliably and affordably and, at the same time, address long-term clean energy solutions and strategies to reduce our carbon footprint."
,,,,These objectives are not mutually exclusive.
,,,,We can — and must — do both.
,,,,"To begin, we need to find a better way forward that can bring diverse stakeholders together in pursuit of an appropriate climate approach."
,,,,"Last April, I set out four ways to jump-start that process."
,,,,"These have as much validity today as they did over six months ago: First, we must promote energy security."
,,,,"Constraining the flow of capital needed to produce and move fuels, especially as the war in Ukraine rages on, is a bad idea."
,,,,The world still needs oil and natural gas today.
,,,,But not all hydrocarbons are equal when it comes to their carbon footprint.
,,,,"We should be directing more capital toward less carbon-intensive fuel sources and investing in innovations, such as carbon capture and sequestration, as we look to transition to green technologies delivered at scale for society."
,,,,JPMorgan Chase is firmly committed to helping finance these kinds of investments and expediting the use of lower-car - bon fuels.
,,,,"We don’t boycott companies — we believe capital About This Report This Climate Report is informed by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”), including the most recent 2021 updates and the supplemental guidance for the financial sector."

,,,,We strive to use our knowledge and expertise to help clients frame and act on their decarbonization plans.
,,,,Our strategy centers on the following key elements: • A framework for assessing our clients’ progress.
,,,,"To bring a climate lens to the way we make financing decisions, we have de veloped an assessmen t methodology of our clients’ emissions and decarbonization plans for consideration in our decision- making in new in-scope financing transactions for in-scope clients in our targeted sectors."
,,,,Our CAF uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate clients’ climate ambition and performance.
,,,,"Quantitative factors include an analysis of the client’s historical emissions reductions, current carbon intensity and forecasted intensity based on publicly announced targets."
,,,,Qualitative factors include reviewing actions the client has taken to drive progress and other strategic actions taken toward decarbonization.
,,,,"Each of these factors is then assigned a score, which contributes to a client’s overall CAF score of 1–5, allowing the carbon assessment results to be reviewed as one consideration alongside other factors in our transaction review process."
,,,,"We believe this is a reasonably designed framework currently, but the Firm will continue to look for enhancement opportunities."

,,,,"Minimizing Our Operational Impact A key component of our approach to sustainability is managing our GHG footprint by reducing our direct and indirect emissions, which stem primarily from the operation of our more than 6,000 corporate offices, bank branches and data centers."
,,,,"To guide our efforts, we have developed a set of operational sustainability targets, many of which are focused on reducing our contribution to climate change."
,,,,"To view progress made toward our sustainability targets, see pages 63–65 in Metrics & Targets."
,,,,"Achieving and Maintaining Operational Carbon Neutrality In 2020, we committed to achieve carbon neutrality across our operations annually."
,,,,This commitment includes Scope 1 (direct) GHG emissions from building operations and company-owned aircraft and vehicles; Scope 2 (indirect) GHG emissions from purchased electricity; and Scope 3 (indirect) GHG emissions associated with business travel.
,,,,"In 2021, we met our carbon-neutral goal for the second year in a row, using carbon credits to help us achieve neutrality."
,,,,We are committed to maintaining carbon-neutral operations each year going forward.
,,,,Our strategy to maintain carbon-neutral operations is focused on the following: CASE STUDY CASE STUDY IMPROVING EFFICIENCY R educing energy use is our first priority.
,,,,"We undertake a variety of energy efficiency measures, including optimizing the use of heating and cooling in our buildings, and seek to expand their implementation across our operations.SOURCING RENEWABLES We are focused on installing on-site solar systems at JPMorgan Chase properties and establishing long-term renewable energy procurement agreements (e.g., Power Purchase Agreements and green power supply contracts)."
,,,,We are working to increase the proportion being met with on-site renewable energy and off-site long-term renewable energy contracts to 70% or more by 2025.
,,,,"In 2021, over 20% of our renewable procurement came from these solutions.PURCHASING ENERGY ATTRIBUTE CERTIFICATES (“EACS”) AND CARBON CREDITS To continue to meet our commitment to source renewable energy for 100% of our global power needs annually and address the remainder of our direct and indirect emissions, we purchase applicable EACs (e.g., Green-E certified Renewable Energy Certificates (“RECs”), International RECs) and carbon credits."
,,,,"28 29 Our Emissions Reduction Pathway To build on our commitment to carbon-neutral operations, in 2021 we announced a new target to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location based) emissions by 40% by 2030 versus a 2017 baseline."
,,,,"As of the end of 2021, we had reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 location-based emissions by 17%."
,,,,"Moving forward, we intend to make further progress by increasing our direct use of renewable energy, upgrading existing heating and cooling systems, and optimizing building space."
,,,,"Over time, as we strive to reduce our operational emissions through these measures, we anticipate needing to buy fewer carbon credits to neutralize our emissions."
,,,,Highlights of our recent emissions reduction efforts include the following: • Data center efficiency.
,,,,"The Firm continues to implement improvements across its data centers by shifting information technology load to newer, more efficient data centers."
,,,,We also endeavor to share what we have learned with others.
,,,,"For instance, in October 2021, we joined the Low Carbon Patent Pledge, through which we will share several key patents related to how we efficiently cool and ventilate our data centers, with the aim of helping to speed the transition to low-carbon technology and energy sources."
,,,,• Solar expansion.
,,,,"We continue to expand on-site solar power at our corporate office buildings and retail branches across the U.S. As of December 31, 2021, we have added solar installations at nearly 300 retail branches in nine states including Arizona, California, Ohio and New York."
,,,,"Our goal is to complete solar installations at approximately 400 additional branches and 125 carports, totaling over 25 megawatts (“MW”) of solar capacity."
,,,,We are also expanding solar installations at our corporate office buildings and expect to deploy approximately 90 MW of additional solar capacity.• 24/7 renewable energy.
,,,,"In 2021, we worked with energy provider EDF to power our buildings in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) with renewable energy around the clock."
,,,,"As part of this effort, our electricity consumption in the U.K. will be matched to renewable generation every minute of the day, providing us with approximately 120,000 megawatt hours (“MWh”) of renewable electricity each year — enough to power our three million square feet of offices in the U.K., or the equivalent of about 33,000 homes."
,,,,• Net zero branch pilot.
,,,,"In 2022, we opened a Chase retail branch in Pico Rivera, California that is piloting a net zero carbon design."
,,,,"Built from the ground up, the new branch will incorporate a full range of low-carbon technologies and building techniques including a wood frame modular design, low-carbon concrete, enhanced insulation, rooftop solar arrays, full electrification and the use of reclaimed asphalt in the parking lots."
,,,,We expect to purchase carbon credits to address any emissions associated with construction that cannot be mitigated via sustainable design.
,,,,The branch is undergoing an intensive 12-month energy performance analysis to provide insights that can inform our approach to designing and retrofitting other branches in the future.
,,,,"Our Approach to Carbon Offsets We believe it is in the interest of all companies to pursue efforts to avoid, reduce and/or neutralize emissions in their own operations and across their value chains."
,,,,Carbon markets can play an important role in accelerating the overall transition to a low-carbon economy.
,,,,"Key benefits may include: • Enabling flexibility for when, where and how emissions are reduced or removed, which can help to lower the aggregate cost of reducing net emissions; • Driving capital toward existing and already scalable solutions, which may help to deliver near-term reductions or removals faster; • Generating economic value for reducing or removing emissions, which can incentivize innovation with the potential to further accelerate decarbonization; • Creating a range of potential environmental, social and/or economic co-benefits, such as pollution reduction, job creation, community development and enhanced resilience."
,,,,"Through a variety of roles, including purchasing credits to address our own emissions, deploying capital to promote decarbonization solutions, and providing strategic advice to support clients’ transition efforts, we participate in voluntary carbon markets which are an important tool for optimizing investments to reduce emissions and drive progress toward the goal of net zero."
,,,,"For more information related to our emissions data and renewable energy use, see Metrics & Targets on pages 63–65."
,,,,"30 31 While we are proud of the steps our Firm has taken to respond to climate-related risks and opportunities in our business, we know we have more work to do, and that we will continue to learn, including from the feedback we receive from stakeholders."
,,,,We also know our efforts will have the greatest impact in combination with those of others.
,,,,"For these reasons, our strategy is supported and strengthened by our ongoing efforts to enhance accountability, transparency and engagement."
,,,,"Realizing Environmental Benefits by Engagement with Our Suppliers At JPMorgan Chase, we recognize that the environmental impact of our operations extends to our suppliers’ practices."
,,,,"As such, we look for opportunities to work with our suppliers to operate more sustainably."
,,,,"For example, during a paper shortage caused by supply chain issues, we worked with one of our suppliers to recycle our paper scraps, convert them to pulp and sell them back to paper mills to use in their manufacturing process."
,,,,"These efforts contributed to the recycling of over 16.5 million pounds of paper, saving an estimated 57 million gallons of water and avoiding more than 8,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (“mtCO 2e”) between January and August of 2022."
,,,,Strengthening Our Sustainability Commitments Through Employee Engagement We encourage our employees to think about how they can live more sustainably.

,,,,We participate in a variety of initiatives focused on advancing sustainability where we share our expertise and learn from other companies and organizations.
,,,,Three examples areJPMorgan Chase believes that responsible corporate citizenship demands a strong commitment to a healthy and informed democracy through civic and community involvement.
,,,,"Our business is subject to extensive laws and regulations, and changes to such laws can significantly affect how we operate, our revenues and the costs we incur."
,,,,"Because of the impact public policy can have on our businesses, employees, communities and customers, we engage with policymakers holding a range of views, on a range of issues — including banking, financial services, cybersecurity, workforce development, small business, tax, trade, and inclusive economic growth, among others — to advance and protect the long-term interests of the Firm."
,,,,We recognize the need for thoughtful public policy on climate- and energy-related matters.
,,,,It can help accelerate the Firm’s progress on sustainability-related business objectives and contribute to sustainable economic growth.
,,,,It is among the prerequisites we view as essential to make the achievement of our and others’ climate targets feasible.
,,,,"We therefore engage with external stakeholders and trade associations on policies that we believe can help make net zero achievable, including by mobilizing capital for green solutions and supporting clients in the low-carbon transition.Examples of our recent climate-related public policy and industry engagements include: • Providing a grant to the Energy Futures Initiative to support its research on public policy issues and barriers for financing the deployment of decarbonization technologies; • Providing a grant to the Climate Leadership Council, and engaging with its recently launched Center for Climate and Trade, which explores and advances policies that leverage trade relationships and guide the global market economy toward greater international cooperation and climate ambition; and • Contributing to the Business Roundtable’s submission to the Environmental Protection Agency advocating methane emission reductions standards for the Oil & Gas sector."
,,,,The Firm belongs to a number of trade associations that advocate on major public policy issues of importance to the Firm and the communities we serve.
,,,,The Firm’s participation in these associations comes with the understanding that we may not always align with all their positions or those of its other members.
,,,,"We are committed to independent decision-making at the Firm and providing appropriate feedback on the efforts by these associations, including where there is misalignment between the Firm’s climate objectives and trade association positions or activities."
,,,,"A list of the Firm’s principal trade associations is disclosed in our Political Engagement Report .Policy and Industry Engagement • In October 2021, we joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (“NZBA”), which brings together a global network of banks committed to considering their lending and investment port - folios with net-zero emissions by 2050."
,,,,Participation in NZBA is part of our effort as we work to develop our own targets for other sectors and engage with a growing number of clients who are aligning their strategies with science-based emission reduction pathways.
,,,,It is also a reflection of our support for the ambition of greater climate action.
,,,,"While we are commit - ted to these objectives, we also have noted that NZBA sets a high bar and its goals are subject to other prerequisites and critical considerations, both within and outside our control."
,,,,"These include the necessity of technological advancements, the evolution of consumer behavior and demand, and the need for thoughtful climate polices — all factors required to make achievement of targets feasible — as well as the potential impact of legal and regulatory obligations and the challenge of balancing our commitment to short-term targets with the need to facilitate an orderly and just transition and energy security."
,,,,"As we engage with NZBA and other industry initiatives to which our efforts are aligned, the Firm will con-tinue to make independent decisions that we believe are best for the long-term success of our business.• We are working to advance climate resilience solutions."
,,,,"For example, with our support, the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center hosted a Resilience Hub at COP26 in Glasgow to build awareness and foster global action to build climate resilience, attracting speakers from 176 participating organizations and over 10,000 visitors."
,,,,"The center-sponsored research has identified challenges from extreme heat, including inequitable public health impacts and significant economic productivity loss."
,,,,We are also supporting a new center-led initiative called “Cool Capital” to identify and quantify opportunities to channel multiple types of capital into on-the-ground solutions to mitigate the effects of extreme heat on people in 12 cities around the world.
,,,,"• We continue to work with Oil & Gas industry participants, the public sector, and non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”) to support improved methane data quality."
,,,,"For example, we engage with the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership, as part of our broader efforts to explore opportunities for industry clients, technology innovators, and data providers to accelerate direct measurement technologies as a preferred method of tracking and reporting methane emissions."
,,,,34 35 Risk Management 36 37 Our Climate Risk Framework • Transition risk refers to the financial and economic implications associated with a societal adjustment to a low-carbon economy.
,,,,"Transition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy, such as legislation and industrial and financial regulation; adoption of new technologies; and shifts in consumer preferences."
,,,,"These drivers could impact our clients, and our business strategy in providing financial services to them."
,,,,Transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical climate.• Physical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss associated with a changing climate.
,,,,"Acute physical risk drivers include increased frequency or severity of climate and weather events (e.g., floods, wildfires, tropical storms, etc.)."
,,,,"Chronic physical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in the climate and include sea level rise, persistent changes in precipitation levels and average ambient temperature increases."
,,,,"Indirect physical risk drivers include the second-order effects of these acute and chronic risks, such as supply chain disruptions or changes to property valuations.As a global financial institution, our clients, operations and business strategy may be impacted by climate change — either from the transition to a low-carbon economy (transition risk) or through the changing climate itself (physical risk)."
,,,,JPMorgan Chase recognizes that climate risk management is a new and rapidly evolving risk discipline.
,,,,"We are investing in talent and improving our data and technology resources to learn and support the identification, quantification and subsequent management of climate risks.JPMC Climate Risk Framework RISK IDENTIFICATIONREPORTING & DISCLOSURESSCENARIO ANALYSISDATA MANAGEMENTRISK GOVERNANCERISK MANAGEMENTWe have developed a climate risk framework and continue to enhance the processes to capture the transmission channels through which transition and physical risk drivers impact each of our four risk types (strategic, credit & investment, market and operational), for example, higher financial costs to companies due to carbon taxes could lead to higher credit risk to the Firm."
,,,,"This framework is comprised of six core firmwide risk capabilities central to enabling assessment, quantification and management of the climate risks that may manifest across our diverse global footprint."
,,,,"In this chapter, we discuss the Risk Identification, Scenario Analysis, and Risk Management capabilities of this framework."
,,,,"38 39 Risk Identification At JPMorgan Chase, businesses are required to examine the activities they are responsible for and to identify, discuss and escalate the associated risks."
,,,,We believe that this practice is the foundation of a risk-aware business culture and an effective risk management process.
,,,,"We have enhanced this process to assess the ways in which climate change can manifest as strategic, credit & investment, market and operational risk types."
,,,,"Supporting this assessment is a classification system, illustrated below, that describes how climate risk drivers could translate into potential impacts to our clients, our exposures and our operations."
,,,,"A number of climate change risk assessments are now included in the Firm’s risk inventory, and more will likely continue to be added to it as we evolve and deepen our examination of climate change."
,,,,Translating Climate Risk Drivers into Potential Risks to the FirmCLIMATE RISK * List is not exhaustive.
,,,,We continue to refine our taxonomy based on an evolving understanding of how climate-related risk drivers may manifest as risks to the Firm.

,,,,"As of 2022, global temperatures are approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels (1850–1900)."
,,,,"We define this as the “current state” of the climate, with assessments of future transition and physical risk based on further warming above this state.7 42 43 Transition Risk Scenario Analysis The Firm applies NGFS-derived macroeconomic variables and sector-level outcomes to individual clients to help assess potential transition risk impacts to the Firm."
,,,,"In order to quantify and understand the range of these impacts, we are using a ‘baseline’ transition risk scenario and a severe transition risk scenario from the NGFS."
,,,,BASELINE The NGFS Current Policies Scenario represents a low-transition risk scenario that captures the current state of global climate policy.
,,,,"The scenario assumes that no future emissions reduction policies are implemented by governments, leading to high physical risks."
,,,,"In this scenario, 3°C or more of warming could occur by 2100."
,,,,98SEVERE TRANSITION RISK The NGFS DNZE represents the most severe transition risk scenario.
,,,,"The scenario assumes that global net-zero is reached by 2050 through higher carbon prices with a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, despite divergence in policies introduced by governments across the world."
,,,,"The scenario assumes that global warming is successfully limited to 1.5°C by 2100, which limits physical risk impacts."
,,,,"Physical Risk Scenario Analysis The Firm applies IPCC-derived physical risk parameters to assess the potential impacts of the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events on our business operations, credit exposures, and collateral locations."
,,,,"Consistent with the transition risk approach, we utilize both a ‘baseline’ physical risk scenario and a severe physical risk scenario to inform the range of outcomes."
,,,,"BASELINE The IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (“RCP”) 4.5 scenario represents an intermediate, middle-of-the-road scenario where social, economic and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns."
,,,,"Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals; overall, the intensity resource and energy use declines."
,,,,"The scenario assumes that global mean temperature reaches 2.7°C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100.SEVERE PHYSICAL RISK The IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario represents the worst-case, highest emissions scenario."
,,,,The scenario assumes that global mean temperature reaches 4.4°C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100 due to the continued exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and a continued rise in resource- and energy-intensive activities around the world.
,,,,"Under this scenario, there is no transition to a low-carbon economy and GHG emissions continue to be very high."
,,,,8 NGFS Scenario Portal 9 Temperature increases are relative to global mean temperatures at pre-industrial levels (1850–1900)Time Horizons The pace and cumulative effects of climate change are important factors in considering the potential financial and economic implications.

,,,,"We leverage our risk identification and scenario analysis to measure the potential adverse impacts the baseline and severe climate risk scenarios may have on our credit portfolios, both today and into the future."
,,,,"We are analyzing the direct impacts of transition and physical risk — considering property damage and financial loss due to extreme weather events or the potential reduction in profitability of a client, counterparty or customer as a result of transitioning from a high-carbon to a lower carbon-intensive footprint."

,,,,"Operational Risk Strategic Risk Credit & Investment Risk Market Risk Country RiskWholesale Credit RiskConsumer Credit RiskLiquidity Reputation Risk Risk CONSUMER CREDIT RISK As of December 31, 2021, the Firm had $1.3 trillion of consumer credit exposure, including residential real estate, auto loans and credit cards."
,,,,The Firm is using catastrophe models to quantify the hypothetical physical damage from various climate- and weather-driven events and applying it to our real estate portfolios to estimate potential financial loss.
,,,,"For example, residential real estate loans made up $225 billion of the total consumer credit portfolio, predominantly in the U.S. Today, climate-related risks for this portfolio are substantially mitigated through geographic diversification of the properties, the prevalence of hazard insurance, and the effective average life of the underlying loans, among other factors."
,,,,"As a result, financial losses due to natural disasters and weather events have not been material to the Firm."
,,,,"As we examine the potential for future impacts, we may consider outcomes in which these mitigants are weakened — for example, if insurance becomes less prevalent.We are using our resources to better understand how transition and physical risks may manifest and their potential impacts on the existing risk types the Firm manages."
,,,,"44 45 The map below shows, at the U.S. county level, the modeled potential increase in property damage due to flooding in 2050 under RCP 8.5 compared to 2020."
,,,,"This includes the impact of heavy rainfall, riverine flooding and storm surges, but assumes that no future mitigation steps are taken (such as improving flood defenses)."
,,,,Third-party analysis such as this helps the Firm to assess the potential susceptibility of our credit portfolio to these events.
,,,,This map was derived utilizing an external risk-based software analytics tool.
,,,,"The cumulative effect of physical climate risk may impact our residential real estate portfolio in several ways, including the following: • Greater physical damages: increased likelihood or severity of extreme weather events may increase consumer credit losses; • Higher insurance premiums: higher insurance premiums may increase living expenses and financial burden for consumers; • Reduced coverage or availability of insurance: insurers may further limit types of damage they cover or withdraw coverage from specific geographies; and • House price impacts: cumulative effect of climate-driven events may adversely impact house prices and local economies in certain geographies, potentially disproportionately impacting lower-income households and communities."
,,,,"Additionally, we are examining how the transition to a low-carbon economy may create financial burden on consumers from potentially higher energy prices, pass-through of carbon taxes on goods and services, or result in declines in the value of other assets (e.g., gas-burning vehicles), which could impact consumers’ ability to repay and may result in additional credit losses to the Firm."

,,,,The Firm is building a framework to estimate the potential impact of a low-carbon transition on clients’ financials and credit ratings.
,,,,"Financial impacts from the carbon transition could manifest in a variety of ways, including weaker demand for carbon-intensive products, resulting in lower revenue, or higher operating costs for carbon-emitting companies as described above."
,,,,"Additionally, companies may need to increase their capital expenditures through investments that improve resilience to the low-carbon transition (e.g., power companies investing in renewables)."

,,,,"To minimize the strategic risks, we follow a facts and science-based approach with the objective of protecting the long-term resilience and value of the Firm."
,,,,"REPUTATION RISK Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may negatively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence by various constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers, investors, regulators, employees, communities or the broader public."
,,,,"Reputational risk assessment is designed to take into account the commercial consequences of actions or inactions that may impact clients, customers, employees, capital providers and other stakeholders."
,,,,In many cases we recognize that a position we take will be favored by some and disapproved of by others and where all positions including neutrality can be controversial.
,,,,"Climate- and environmental-related business strategies and activities are under increasing scrutiny, and companies are facing reputational risk from the real or perceived lack of progress made toward climate-related commitments, as well as in how they provide transparency around climate-related matters."
,,,,The Firm may face reputation risk relating to its climate risk framework and environmental sustainability strategy.
,,,,Future Improvements Access to quality climate data remains a key challenge for climate risk managers.
,,,,"The lack of historical data, given that there is no precedent for what is being projected into the future, makes any climate risk methodology difficult to back-test and is subject to a wide array of assumptions."
,,,,"This is in contrast to many other areas of risk (e.g., credit risk, market risk), which can draw upon decades worth of history on corporate defaults and market dislocations."
,,,,"We are working to improve the depth and breadth of our climate data and technology infrastructure to take advantage of anticipated data enhancements across the industry, such as: • Enhanced corporate emissions data and underlying estimation techniques; • Improved company-level assessments of transition plans and credibility of those plans, based on a combination of publicly-announced emissions targets and expertise of client coverage teams; • Expanded company and supply chain location data for physical risk vulnerability assessments."
,,,,"These future data improvements may help us to model climate risks in a way that captures more than just the direct impacts (e.g., property damage, credit losses from companies subject to a carbon tax), which would allow us to enhance our analysis with indirect impacts (e.g., from economic effects, commodity price impacts, or population migration) and to be more comprehensive in the way we manage climate risk."
,,,,"Market Risk Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term."
,,,,"Climate risk drivers may lead to sharp volatility or persistent changes in the prices of commodities and financial assets, for example, companies in carbon intensive industry sectors without credible transition plans may have assets which are viewed as stranded, resulting in materially depressed equity prices."
,,,,The Firm has established a stress framework to quantify the impact of the transition risk stress scenarios to vulnerable asset classes.
,,,,We have analyzed a series of physical drivers to estimate the potential impacts of various climate- and weather-driven events to our markets exposures.
,,,,"Country Risk The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the riskiness of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries."
,,,,"The negative implications from climate change may impact a country’s economic, fiscal, monetary and political frameworks in numerous ways, in turn adversely affecting its sovereign credit ratings."
,,,,"Climate risk considerations are incorporated, as appropriate, in existing sovereign ratings and risk management processes."
,,,,"In addition, the Firm has developed a score to help explore the potential sensitivity of sovereign ratings to climate risks beyond the standard rating horizon or under specific stress scenarios."

,,,,"Below, we provide details of the metrics and targets we have developed for these purposes."
,,,,"Updates on Our Paris-Aligned Financing CommitmentNew Sector Targets When we announced our first set of portfolio-level emissions intensity reduction targets, we also committed to set targets for addi - tional sectors in the future."
,,,,"As part of this report, we are releasing details of the initial baselines and 2030 targets we have set for Iron & Steel, Cement and Aviation."
,,,,"Among other reasons, we have prioritized these sectors — together with those we have previously set targets for — based on their contribution to total global emissions, their importance to the wider economy and our aim to help them overcome the significant challenges they face to decarbonize."
,,,,The aggregate of these six sectors account for the majority of global emissions across the supply and demand side value chains of the global energy system.
,,,,"Our work reflects not only our aim to tackle the largest and most challenging sources of emissions, but also our commitment to engage and support our clients as they navigate the low-carbon transition."
,,,,"OUR APPROACH TO SETTING PORTFOLIO TARGETS In 2021, we set portfolio-level emissions intensity reduction targets for three sectors in our financing portfolio — Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing — in line with science-based emission reduction pathways."
,,,,"Now, we have set net-zero emissions by 2050 targets for three additional sectors — Iron & Steel, Cement and Aviation."
,,,,"Below we provide an update on our approach, details of our three new targets, performance to date of our existing targets, and details of how we are managing ongoing data challenges as we work to implement those targets."
,,,,"Metrics The emissions metrics we use to evaluate the emissions performance of the sectors for which we have set 2030 targets are currently intensity-based, meaning they measure emissions relative to a given unit of output (e.g., kilograms of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour of electricity generation)."
,,,,"Intensity-based metrics currently provide the most decision- useful and effective way for us to evaluate performance at the sector- and client- level against science-based scenarios, and to engage with our clients to advise them on capital allocation decisions."
,,,,We continue to evaluate the comparative strengths and advantages of both absolute and intensity-based metrics.
,,,,Absolute-based metrics are also an area of interest for many of our stakeholders and have a role to play in how we understand the impact of our emissions reduction efforts.
,,,,"In 2023, we intend to share more details on our approach to absolute-based metrics, including disclosure of absolute financed emissions in key sectors of our financing portfolio."
,,,,"How We Measure Portfolio-Level Emissions Intensity for Targeted Sectors To measure portfolio-level emissions intensity in each of the included sectors, we compute a portfolio-weighted average of emissions performance for our clients in the sector portfolio."
,,,,Weights are determined based on our cumulative financing to each client as a share of our total financing to the sector.
,,,,We include both financing that we directly provide (such as through revolving credit facilities) as well as our share of facilitated financing (such as through our underwriting in debt and equity capital markets).
,,,,The vast majority of this activity occurs in our CIB and CB LOBs.
,,,,"In the case of revolving credit facilities, financing amounts reflect the total limit of available credit outstanding, not just the drawn amount."
,,,,"The following highlights key aspects of the methodology for each of the newly included sectors: Cement We evaluate GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) from cement manufacturing, which include both energy-related and process emissions and account for approximately 90% of total lifecycle emissions for the industry."
,,,,"By using cementitious product, we are able to capture both the primary driver of sector emissions (i.e., clinker production) and potential levers for reducing them, including the use of cement and clinker substitutes.Iron & Steel We focus on GHG emissions associated with crude steel production (Scopes 1 and 2), which captures emissions and activity from both primary and secondary steelmaking processes and accounts for approximately 97% of total value chain emissions for the sector."
,,,,"This enables us to account for variations in the emissions profiles of different steelmaking processes while also concentrating on the full range of decarbonization strategies for the sector, including electrification, increasing scrap recycling, using lower-carbon energy inputs such as biomass or hydrogen, and deploying carbon capture, use and storage technologies.JPMC Sector = Σ Client Weight Client Portfolio in JPMC Sector Emissions Metric Portfolio (%) × Emissions Metric ( )Aviation Our target focuses on direct (Scope 1) CO 2 emissions for revenue-generating passenger service and belly freight operations of airline companies, specifically from combustion of fuels during flight."
,,,,"This allows us to focus on companies’ relative progress in reducing and ultimately replacing the use of fossil-based jet fuel, which is the primary driver of the sector’s climate impact."

,,,,"Externally, we are engaging with our clients on key climate topics and helping them transition toward a low-carbon future."
,,,,"Using our expertise in providing advisory services and facilitating capital, we are working with our clients toward formulating and taking action toward achieving their transition strategies."
,,,,"Internally, we created our CAF process to score clients on their carbon performance as one consideration as part of our decision-making for new transactions within in-scope sectors and have set up governance frameworks to monitor and guide our progress."
,,,,"We believe the actions we are taking today will position us well to accelerate progress toward our targets in the years ahead — understanding that such progress will not be linear, and knowing it will take time to implement effective solutions while also continuing to promote energy security and meet important economic and societal needs around the world."
,,,,We are committed to responding to this challenge over the long term.
,,,,"The below table summarizes our portfolio emissions intensity for the Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing sectors as of June 30, 2022."
,,,,More detail on our progress in each of these sectors is provided below.
,,,,To learn more about the methodology for setting sector-specific targets please see our Carbon Compass SM methodology (2021).Oil & Gas We have two 2030 targets for our Oil & Gas portfolio: Operational (covering Scopes 1 and 2) and End Use (covering Scope 3).
,,,,"As noted in our Carbon Compass SM (2021) methodology , improving visibility, quality and availability of data may also necessitate restatements of our baselines from time to time."
,,,,"We utilize a quantitative and qualitative materiality approach to assess the appropriateness of restatement for each baseline metric, where applicable."
,,,,"As such, we have revised our Oil & Gas Operational 2019 baseline to reflect data quality improvements over the past year."
,,,,See page 62 for more details on the data challenges we have experienced and how we are working to address them.
,,,,"Against this revised 2019 baseline, progress on our Oil & Gas Operational 2030 target remains flat, reflecting marginal emissions intensity and financing changes in the portfolio."
,,,,We expect the portfolio will benefit from the maturity of our CAF process and continued assessments of new in-scope transactions over time.
,,,,"Progress on our Oil & Gas End Use 2030 target, as of June 30 2022, is marginally higher compared to our 2019 baseline, driven by portfolio companies shifting their fuel production mix."
,,,,The difference between the relative carbon intensity of oil and natural gas means that a tilt toward oil will result in higher portfolio End Use carbon intensity.
,,,,"Amidst the backdrop of the pandemic and volatile commodity markets, our portfolio fuel mix for the 2020 emissions year had a higher proportion of oil than natural gas products, resulting in a higher End Use emissions intensity compared to 2019."
,,,,"While we recognize the necessity and likelihood of the long-term shift of energy demand away from fossil fuels, the challenging macroeconomic environment that we are operating in makes the decreases in both Operational and End Use carbon intensity our clients are expecting to achieve difficult.Electric Power Electric Power portfolio emissions intensity has decreased significantly compared to our 2019 baseline."
,,,,This was driven by a combination of our clients moving their generation mix to lower emissions sources and the Firm increasing financing to companies and projects with lower emissions intensity.
,,,,Auto Manufacturing Auto Manufacturing portfolio emissions intensity has decreased compared to our 2019 baseline.
,,,,This was driven mainly by banking new and emerging pure-play EV manufacturers that are bringing EVs to customers across the globe.
,,,,"The sector’s overall effort to embrace and speed toward an all-EV future, as well as the behavioral and policy changes that are catalyzing the shift are prerequisites and critical considerations in allowing us to continue to make progress toward our portfolio-level emissions intensity reduction target."
,,,,14 The targets above are based on available data and scenario projections as of April 2021.
,,,,"Future updates to the IEA SDS scenario and/or other inputs — for example, to reflect changes in global emissions, available technologies or economic conditions — may result in changes to the required emissions trajectories, and therefore our targets for these sectors."
,,,,"Improving visibility, quality and availability of data may also necessitate additional restatements of our 2019 baseline for one or more of the included sectors."
,,,,We regularly monitor these changes and assess the need to recalibrate our metrics and targets as appropriate.
,,,,15 Revised 2019 portfolio baseline to 5.4 g CO 2e / MJ from originally disclosed 6.1 g CO 2e / MJ.
,,,,The reduction and restatement of 2019 baseline Oil & Gas Operational Emissions Intensity is mainly due to a change in historic equity ownership data inputs to our model for a subset of our portfolio companies.
,,,,"60 61 DATA CHALLENGES Improving the quality, timeliness and availability of data is a key component to properly measure emissions and monitor progress over time."
,,,,"This section summarizes the key points on data considerations and challenges that we continue to face, and the steps we are taking to address them."
,,,,Measurement vs. Estimation There are well-known challenges with the quality and reliability of emissions data in many sectors.
,,,,This means we sometimes rely on estimated versus directly measured emissions data.
,,,,"For example, in the Oil & Gas sector, there are inconsistencies in the measurement, management and reporting of data across organizations, as well as the lack of reliable and standardized techniques for measurement in certain areas, such as methane emissions."
,,,,"As a result, reported methane emissions rely on estimation methods that are less accurate."
,,,,We are working with industry partners and NGOs to help make direct measurement technologies the preferred method of tracking and reporting methane emissions.
,,,,"More generally, emerging best practices, including reporting to organizations which provide data aggregation services and soliciting assurance for reported GHG emissions data, are steps in the right direction."
,,,,Data Lag Another challenge we consistently face is with the timely availability of data inputs to calculate carbon intensity.
,,,,"In the Auto Manufacturing sector, for example, certain data from regulatory sources can experience significant delays — sometimes two to three years."
,,,,"In such cases, we seek to address gaps using a defined data waterfall approach that may include company-disclosed figures, provided they are verified and prepared in line with recommended protocols that we have identified."
,,,,"Failing that, we use proxy values, though they may not always be ideal for decision-making."
,,,,"As climate- and sustainability-focused disclosure becomes more standardized, we expect lags — especially on company-reported data — to reduce gradually."
,,,,"Comparable Methodologies While we seek to design and implement robust proxies that minimize the impact on our portfolio when preferred data becomes available, there are cases where this may not be achievable."
,,,,"For example, in our Electric Power portfolio, a small proportion of companies for which no data is available receive a default carbon intensity based on a relatively conservative proxy."
,,,,"Unless the company’s North America Industry Classification System (“NAICS”) codes or project financing use of proceeds indicate it to be a zero-emitting power producer, in which case it is assigned a carbon intensity of zero, the company is assigned a fuel mix that is equal parts coal and natural gas."
,,,,"However, due to the large differences between the emissions intensities of the different fuel types, there could be significant differences between proxies and actual data."
,,,,"To mitigate this, we are continuing to work with our clients and other stakeholders to improve overall quality and availability of data."
,,,,We expect to periodically review our data sourcing choices to assess whether better alternatives have become available.
,,,,"Lack of Data on Emerging Decarbonization Technologies Emerging technologies such as hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture, use and storage and carbon credits — will play a key role in helping clients decarbonize."
,,,,"However, data availability in these areas remains a significant challenge."
,,,,"Innovative solutions continue to emerge — such as the use of blockchain to trace carbon credit ownership and retirement, mitigating concerns associated with the use of unverified public reports — but lack the scale today that is necessary to meaningfully impact our portfolio-level emissions intensity."
,,,,We recognize that data in this space is evolving and will require us to consider viable data solutions as they may become available.
,,,,"Minimizing Our Operational Impact Our commitment to minimizing the environmental impact of our operations includes measuring and reporting our Scope 1, 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions and setting targets to improve our performance across several related dimensions."
,,,,"A summary of our current operational targets is provided below, followed by a detailed breakdown and discussion of our performance in key climate-related areas."
,,,,"GHG Emissions JPMorgan Chase’s 2021 operational GHG emissions were driven by two primary activities: powering our buildings (e.g., electricity, heating and cooling) and business travel."
,,,,Scope 1 GHG emissions include those from building operations and company-owned aircraft and vehicles.
,,,,"Scope 2 emissions, from purchased electricity, are the largest driver of our building-related emissions and overall operational GHG footprint."
,,,,The majority of our business travel-related emissions are Scope 3 emissions from commercially operated air and rail; reimbursed personal vehicle and rental car travel; and hotel stays.
,,,,"A small portion of our business travel emissions are Scope 1 emissions from company-owned aircraft and vehicles.In 2020, we set a target to achieve and maintain carbon neutrality across our global operations annually, which we have met for each of the last two years (2020 and 2021) through the purchase of carbon credits."
,,,,"Although we aim to continue maintaining carbon neutrality and meeting 100% of our global power needs with renewable energy, we also believe it is important to continue working to reduce our underlying emissions on an ongoing basis."
,,,,"To that end, in 2021 we announced a new target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 (location- based) emissions by 40% by 2030 from a 2017 baseline.2021 Progress Towards Our Operational Sustainability Targets Reduc e office paper use by 90% by 2025 vs. a 2017 baselineReduce global water use by 20% by 2030 vs. a 2017 baselineMaintain carbon neutral operations TARGET MET ANNUALLY RECURRINGTARGET MET ANNUALLY RECURRINGTARGET MET ANNUALLY RECURRINGTARGET MET ANNUALLY RECURRINGSource renewable energy for 100% of our global power needsDivert 100% of e-waste from landﬁlls Reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 vs. a 2017 baselinePurchase 100% of our paper from certiﬁed sources Satisfy at least 70% of our renewable energy goal with on-site renewable energy and off-site long-term renewable energy contracts by 2025 TARGET PROGRESS TARGET PROGRESS TARGET PROGRESS 100 40%TARGET PROGRESS 17% 100 23% 100 8% 70% 20%100 55% 90% 62 63 GHG Emissions 2017 –202116 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 GHG EMISSIONS (mt CO 2e),iii Scope 1 – directiii84,911 81,944 102,423 98,505 93,031 Natural gas 58,820 55,080 68,428 64,975 60,422 Propane 57 228 300 260 234 Fuel oil 627 629 1,391 1,500 1,387 Jet fuel 6,228 4,013 8,558 8,640 9,160 Fugitive emissions 17,517 18,940 19,448 20,903 20,121 Diesel 1,031 2,568 2,881 1,302 1,655 Fleet 631 486 1,416 924 52 Scope 2 (location) – indirect 755,514 816,056 851,622 919,876 922,762 Purchased electricity 749,234 811,127 842,994 907,508 913,188 Purchased steam and chilled water 6,280 4,929 8,627 12,368 9,574 Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location) 840,425 898,000 954,045 1,018,381 1,015,794 Change from 2017 baseline -17% -12% -6% 0% - GHG emissions intensityiv6.9 7.5 8.2 9.3 10.1 Scope 2 (market) – indirect 6,280 4,929 711,595 746,043 793,746 Purchased electricity - - 702,968 733,675 784,172 Purchased steam and chilled water 6,280 4,929 8,627 12,368 9,574 Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market) 91,191 86,873 814,018 844,548 886,777 Scope 3 (category 6 – business travel)v 38,336 36,169 181,004 176,356 187,020 Verified carbon offset emissions reductions 129,527 123,042 189,327 184,769 175,155 Net emissions: Scope 1, 2 (market), and 3 - - 805,694 8 36,135 898,642 i.

,,,,"Since 2020, we have achieved our target of meeting 100% of our global power needs annually using renewable energy, which we have accomplished through a combination of on-site installations at JPMorgan Chase facilities and the purchase of renewable energy via both EACs and long-term power purchase agreements."
,,,,The table summarizes our global energy consumption by displaying renewable energy use obtained via either on-site generation or contractual instruments.
,,,,"In recognition of the challenges and limitations associated with many av ailable EACs, we are also working to increase the proportion of renewable energy we source via other methods, including on-site generation and long-term power purchase agreements."
