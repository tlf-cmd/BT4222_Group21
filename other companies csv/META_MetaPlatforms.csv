But the task ahead is massive.,,
"As both a company and a platform for social connection, we take our responsibility seriously.",,
We’ll continue our sustainability work across our business and products—and will share our progress through reports like this one.,,
"At Meta, we’re building technology that will help shape the next chapter of the internet and the future of social connection.",,
"These long-term investments are in service of a vision for the future where everyone can be present with each other, create new opportunities, and experience new things.",,
We view our sustainability work with this same eye to the future.,,
"After all, the possibilities that our technology will unlock for people only matter if we have a safe and thriving planet.",,
We think about our work here in three areas: limiting the environmental footprint of our operations and devices; driving climate action with our products; and forming partnerships to scale our impact.,,
"On our operations, thanks to innovations in our data center and office designs, we’ve driven up efficiency and driven down our environmental footprint.",,
But we have more work to do.,,
We’ve achieved net zero emissions in our global operations and set a goal to reach net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030.,,
"We’ve also set an ambitious goal for our global operations to be water positive by 2030, meaning we’ll restore more water than we consume.",,
"On driving climate action, we’ve expanded our Climate Science Center to reach millions of people around the world with authoritative information about climate change.",,
And we’re working closely with experts to combat false or misleading information.,,
"On partnerships to scale our impact, we recently announced a joint $925 million commitment alongside Stripe, Shopify, McKinsey, and Alphabet to accelerate the development of carbon removal technologies over the next 9 years.",,
"This is just one of many ways we’re collaborating with others across industry, nonprofit, academia, and government to combine forces for greater impact.",,
Our 2021 Sustainability Report dives deep on the progress we’re making across these areas.,,
"As we work to provide people around the world with equitable access to opportunities, we’ve also committed to upholding the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles and to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.",,
We’re committed to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights too.,,
"Sustainability, human rights, economic opportunity—these are all interconnected and we’re taking a holistic approach to make sure we’re driving positive change globally.",,
The defining quality of the metaverse will be a feeling of presence—like you are right there with another person or in another place.,,
"That feeling of presence is an incredibly powerful tool to build empathy, understanding, and collaboration.",,
"Students will be able to take field trips to the melting ice caps or a wind farm, without leaving their classroom.",,
"Journalists will be able to tell immersive, first-person stories of climate refugees that help their audience feel the impact on people’s lives.",,
Experts from around the world can get together around a virtual table to discuss solutions and advance climate action.,,
2021 Meta Sustainability Report 4 Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.,,
The surge in traffic we observed on our platforms when the COVID-19 pandemic began demonstrated the ever-growing role Meta plays in keeping people connected across the world.,,
"Meaningful connections are not possible without a safe and healthy world—one in which diverse experiences are respected, accurate information is amplified over the noise, and bold climate action is truly making a difference.",,
We can all agree that changes to global temperature and climate present overwhelming challenges—both environmental and social.,,
"We take our role, and the responsibility that comes with it, seriously.",,
"At our core, we strive to protect both people and the planet through responsible operations.",,
"For the last decade, we have invested in ways to make our own operations more water-and energy-efficient with a focus on sustainable solutions for the resources we do use.",,
"Put simply, we aim to use less—less water and less energy—and to reduce unnecessary waste.",,
"As of 2020, our global operations reached net zero emissions and are supported by 100% renewable energy.",,
"We are now reaching toward the goals of net zero emissions across our value chain and becoming water positive throughout our operations, aiming to achieve both of these milestones in 2030.",,
"Although this report looks back on 2021 and all the progress we have made, I cannot help looking forward and thinking about all the questions yet to be answered and the work yet to be done.",,
One thing that became clear in 2021 as we mapped out our net zero strategy was the difficulty in driving pathways for consistent reductions across our operations for a rapidly growing business.,,
We know our Scope 3 emissions are increasing—and will continue to increase in the near term—as we grow to support the global demand for the services we provide.,,
"For example, to support the infrastructure necessary to connect people around the world, we are building more data centers and networks that will provide capacity and reliability on our platforms, and will enable our transition to the metaverse.",,
"We will work to address our Scope 3 emissions by optimizing for low carbon in our business decisions, collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions and exploring interventions that decarbonize our broader value chain, both upstream and downstream.",,
"In addition to focusing on carbon reductions, we realize the need to be innovative and push for new ways to collaborate with others.",,
"After all, the challenge of reaching net zero is an industry- wide problem, and as an industry, we will need to collectively realize our goals for the climate by working together.",,
A Message from Rachel Peterson Vice President of InfrastructureAbout Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 5 Our recent investment in Frontier AMC↗ is just one example of our belief that we can do far more for the climate through industry collaborations—and the ways we are working with corporate partners to push for faster advancement of technological carbon removals.,,
"We continue to partner with leading thinkers to develop new ways to accelerate adoption of sustainable materials and fuels for construction, hardware and transportation.",,
"Industry leaders, governments and other stakeholders know that Scope 3 emissions are difficult to measure and reduce.",,
"We remain committed to leading internal and external discussions and partnerships to drive industry standards and reductions throughout our value chain.Finally, as we look forward, we believe that we must build on achieving our 100% renewable energy goals by optimizing our energy strategy to drive emissions reductions at a grid-scale.",,
"We will do this by maintaining our commitment to 100% renewable energy; creating innovative approaches to drive emissions out of the sector while improving reliability; and collaborating with peers, grid operators, utilities and other stakeholders to advance the zero emissions, reliable grid of the future.Despite the unknowns, from the planning and analysis we completed in 2021, we know our ambitious 2030 targets will require significant shifts in how we build infrastructure, increase operational discipline and invest in existing and emerging nature- based and technological solutions to reduce and remove emissions.",,
"We will work to do all of this while growing our business to meet the demands of tomorrow.We are humbled by these challenges and grateful to be part of a community of climate leaders, sustainability-focused organizations, government leaders and committed corporations all coming together to allow us to scale our efforts and enable bold climate action.",,
This is hard and very important work.,,
"It is how we will bring the world closer together—and together, how we will help the world move closer to better.",,
Switching to a clean economy could raise $2.8 trillion through carbon price revenues and the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies to public investments.,,
A MESSAGE FROM RACHEL PETERSONAbout Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 6 What is your vision for the future of Meta’s sustainability strategy?,,
"We have made a lot of progress over the past decade—driving up efficiency and driving down our environmental footprint, especially in how we design, build and operate our global offices and data centers.",,
"But, we have so much more important work to do.",,
"For example, we have worked for years to drive sustainability into our value chain through our responsible supply chain program.",,
"Meta’s sustainability strategy in the coming years will be to expand our value chain and partnership programs to Q&A with Edward Palmieri Director of Global Sustainability Edward Palmieri joined Meta in 2010 and served as a member of the company’s legal team for many years, while nurturing his passion for environmental justice and sustainability.",,
"As a new parent, Palmieri decided it was time for a shift in career focus.",,
"He joined Meta’s Global Sustainability team as Director, allowing him to merge his work with his passion.",,
"include working with internal Meta teams and our global partners to fight climate change through emissions reductions and removals, water stewardship and biodiversity projects, and meaningful collaborations to invest in new solutions and scale our work.",,
Our strategy comes to life through three pillars: 1.,,
"How We Operate—protecting the well-being of people and our planet through our processes, operations and global supply chain 2.",,
What We Create—amplifying scientists and climate leaders through our products and platforms 3.,,
How We Collaborate—engaging with experts and supporting established initiatives in the climate spaceHow is Meta approaching its journey to net zero value chain emissions?,,
We embrace our responsibility as a global company to address the climate challenge that impacts us all.,,
"On our journey to reach net zero emissions across our value chain, we will lead by example while following what science tells us must be done to align with the Paris Agreement.",,
"We are focusing on reducing our Scope 3 emissions, which means radically changing the way we operate and helping our suppliers to set their own climate targets.",,
"This work to use less, choose better, embrace low-carbon technology and collaborate with our suppliers will be a very long and complex journey.",,
"For us, our net zero goal is more than an announcement; it is a program designed to drive real emissions reductions and lasting changes to our infrastructure and supply chain.",,
How will the metaverse impact sustainability?,,
"At Meta, we are committed to building tools that make choosing to connect virtually easier than ever.",,
"And while we are at the beginning of what will be a long and constantly changing journey, we are excited about giving people the ability to choose options that have a smaller environmental impact.",,
"Still, the metaverse is new and the growth of our business to support the creation of these new tools presents challenges.",,
"The expansion of hardware, construction and operation of new data centers and other capital goods means that we must continue to drive toward more sustainable construction and operational business practices.",,
"About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 7 We are now beginning to investigate how we can support our business growth while integrating with low-carbon technology, renewable energy, hardware circularity, reduced water usage and other climate- conscious initiatives included in this report.",,
"Despite all the progress we are making and our plans for the future, the path to a sustainable metaverse will not always be easy.",,
"For example, at first, we expect to see an increase in our emissions.",,
"But, ultimately, the work we are doing during these foundational years will drive the innovation and collaboration across our business that enables us to grow sustainably.",,
How are the sustainability and human rights agendas connected at Meta?,,
The shared values and aspirations of the human rights and environmental movements are increasingly apparent.,,
The primary victims of environmental harm are often marginalized communities where people cannot claim their rights to live in a healthy environment.,,
Linking our sustainability and Q&A WITH EDWARD PALMIERI human rights agendas at Meta is an important step forward— whether that means taking into consideration the populations most impacted by transitioning to a zero-carbon economy or investing in the well-being of workers across our supply chain.,,
Not only is this the right thing to do but also it signals to our employees and stakeholders that we are committed to protecting the rights we all deserve.,,
What gives you confidence that Meta can be a driving force for industry change?,,
Our people and our commitment to real impact at scale give me confidence.,,
"With the technical and professional talent we have assembled, our team is poised to evolve the way Meta and the technology industry approach sustainability.",,
Our employees truly care about this.,,
Sustainability is not an add-on for us.,,
It is a driving force in itself that motivates innovation in what we do and how we do it.Our scale also gives me confidence.,,
"We have the global reach, expertise and platforms to make a meaningful difference in markets.",,
"We are working to support lower-emissions solutions across our business, which we believe will translate to market availability for others as well.",,
We are doing this through our own direct investments (like with our renewable energy projects) and through partnerships (like our investments in carbon removal and reduction solutions and technologies).,,
"In fact, one of the most wonderful things about working in the sustainability field is how collaborative it is.",,
"When we look at the Open Compute Project↗, for example, we have seen the power of collaboration.",,
"I know we can do even more to set an example for better technologies and capacity-building in our supply chain.At Meta, we are building tools that make choosing to connect virtually easier than ever.",,
"1,200+ companies have set science-based targets in line with net zero emissions.",,
"About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 8 Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.Our MissionAbout Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 9 Note: On October 28, 2021, Facebook, Inc. changed its name to Meta.",,

This means acting with urgency and not waiting until next week to do something you could do today.,,
"At our scale, this also means continuously working to increase the velocity of our highest priority initiatives by methodically removing barriers that get in the way.",,
"It is about moving fast together—in one direction as a company, not just as individuals.",,
"Focus on Long-Term Impact emphasizes long-term thinking and encourages us to extend the timeline for the impact we have, rather than optimizing for near-term wins.",,
"We should take on the challenges that will be the most impactful, even if the full results will not be seen for years.",,
Build Awesome Things pushes us to ship things that are not just good but also awe-inspiring.,,
"We have already built products that are useful to billions of people, but in our next chapter, we will focus more on inspiring people as well.",,
This quality bar should apply to everything we do.,,
"Live in the Future guides us to build the future of distributed work that we want, where opportunity is not limited by geography.",,
"This means operating as a distributed-first company and being the early adopters of the future products we are building to help people feel present together, no matter where they are.Be Direct and Respect Your Colleagues is about creating a culture where we are straightforward and willing to have hard conversations with each other.",,
"At the same time, we are respectful, and when we share feedback, we recognize that many of the world’s leading experts work here.",,
"Meta, Metamates, Me is about being good stewards of our company and mission.",,
It is about the sense of responsibility we have for our collective success and to each other as teammates.,,

"To investigate this possibility, we analyzed all link shares and reshares on Meta’s Facebook platform (e.g., shares and reshares of news articles) in the United States from August 2019 to December 2020 (containing billions of aggregated and de- identified shares and reshares).",,
We then identified all link shares and reshares on “climate change” and “global warming” from this repository to develop a social media salience index—the Climate SMSI score—and found an 80% decrease in climate change content sharing and resharing as COVID-19 spread during the spring of 2020.,,
Climate change salience then briefly rebounded in the autumn of 2020 during a period of record-setting wildfires and droughts in the United States before returning to low content sharing and resharing levels.,,
This fluctuating pattern suggests new climate communication strategies—focused on “systemic sustainability”—are necessary.,,

"“Other data center-related facilities” includes facilities where Meta used less than 100,000 MWh of electricity in the reporting year, such as warehouses or colocation facilities.",,
"Owned, online data centers are always reported by site, even if they were below this threshold.",,
3.,,
Meta’s methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions can be found here↗ .,,
4.,,
"Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated annually based on the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol↗ .",,
5.,,
"(a) Scope 1 includes emissions from diesel, natural gas and refrigerants from offices and data centers and from diesel and gasoline in the transportation fleet owned and controlled by Meta.",,
"(b) Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity of offices and warehouses leased, controlled and owned by Meta; electricity of data centers owned and leased (IT load) by Meta; natural gas of offices and warehouses leased and serviced by Meta; and purchased heat.",,
"Because Meta does not control building operations in leased data center facilities, as of 2017, only emissions associated with its IT load electricity are included in Scope 2 emissions.",,
(c) Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions throughout Meta’s value chain.,,
"Starting in 2019, Meta included emissions from all relevant categories in Scope 3.",,
"Scope 3 emissions for 2015 to 2018 include business travel, employee commute and construction.",,
6.,,
"In the 2021 reporting year, two updates to reporting were applied to 2020 and later inventories: (a) Data from life cycle assessments for our hardware and sold products were used to calculate our Scope 3 emissions.",,
(b) 2020 use of sold product numbers were recalculated to improve accuracy.,,
7.,,
"Prior to 2020, Meta invested in avoided emissions offsets which are not considered carbon removal.",,
8.,,
"In the 2019 reporting year, three updates to reporting were applied to 2017 (baseline year) and later inventories: (a) Vehicles operated by the Transportation team in support of commuting and inter-campus travel were previously counted in Scope 3 – Employee commute.",,
"After re-visiting Meta’s operational control of these vehicles, it was determined that they should be accounted for in Scope 1.",,
(b) It was determined that Meta overestimated natural gas emissions by including estimates for offices which do not in fact use natural gas.,,
Recalculations have been applied to the inventory to remove these inaccuracies.,,
(c) Fugitive emissions from refrigerant losses at offices not under Meta operational control were moved from Scope 2 to Scope 3.,,
9.,,
"In the 2020 reporting year, two emission factors updates significantly impacted the GHG inventory: (a) Economic-Environmental Input-Output emission factors were updated and applied to relevant categories.",,
2019 numbers were updated to reflect these new emission factors.,,
(b) Waste emission factors were updated and applied starting in 2020.,,
10.,,
"In the 2020 reporting year, two updates to the methodology were applied: (a) A new business travel methodology was developed, which was applied to 2019 and updated.",,
Air travel still includes radiative forcing starting from 2017.,,
"(b) Employee commuting now includes telecommuting, or work-from-home, emissions starting in 2020, for which the electricity portion is matched with renewable energy.",,
11.,,
Sustainable Aviation Fuel was purchased in 2021 and associated emissions reductions are reflected in the inventory.,,
12.,,
"This includes the following categories in Scope 3: downstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, upstream leased assets, and end-of-life treatment of sold products.",,
"Prior to 2020, emissions from use of sold products and upstream transportation and distribution are included in this category.",,
13.,,
"In owned and leased data center facilities included in Scope 2 and 3 emissions, Meta has matched building operations with renewable energy.",,
14.,,
"Power Use Effectiveness (PUE) and Water Use Effectiveness (WUE) is calculated based on best available data, including internal meters, design estimates and utility bills where applicable.",,

,"For high-risk suppliers, we conduct deeper assessments and partner closely to ensure they have prepared sufficiently for climate risks.",
,"Reaching net zero emissions means that, for any emissions we cannot reduce, we are removing the same amount of GHGs from the atmosphere as we emit.",
,A simple example of a carbon removal project is planting new trees to sequester carbon.,
,Some carbon offsets are considered “avoided emissions” offsets.,
,An example of this type of offset is paying for someone to not cut down an existing forest that would otherwise likely be cut.,
,"While we believe investment in these types of offsets has a very important role in mitigating climate change and are critical from a biodiversity perspective, our net zero goal aims to remove our emissions rather than offset their effects.",
,We follow the Science Based Targets initiative criteria for emissions reduction and removal in line with a pathway to limit temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.,

,"8 Prior to 2020, Facebook invested in avoided emissions offsets which are not considered carbon removal.",
,"9 In the 2019 reporting year, three updates to reporting were applied to 2017 (baseline year) and later inventories: (a) Vehicles operated by the Transportation team in support of commuting and inter-campus travel were previously counted in Scope 3 – Employee commute.",
,"After re-visiting Facebook’s operational control of these vehicles, it was determined that they should be accounted for in Scope 1.",
,(b) It was determined that Facebook overestimated natural gas emissions by including estimates for offices which do not in fact use natural gas.,
,Recalculations have been applied to the inventory to remove these inaccuracies.,
,(c) Fugitive emissions from refrigerant losses at offices not under Facebook operational control were moved from Scope 2 to Scope 3.,

,"Furthermore, Facebook’s GHG data undergoes a third party review each year to verify our emissions and methodology.",
,This is completed annually to ensure that only the most accurate and up-to-date data is publicly reported.,
,"We quantify our GHG emissions via activity data, life cycle assessments (LCAs), and financial data.",
,"We prioritize calculating our emissions through activity data which directly measures an activity that results in GHG emissions, such as kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity.",
,"Due to the complex nature of our business and value chain, we use other methods to help calculate our emissions when activity data is not available.How We Calculate Our GHG EmissionsScope 3 emissions our value chain emissions upstream and downstream of our operationsUpstream: • Purchased goods and services (e.g., upstream emissions from purchased office supplies) • Capital goods (e.g., server hardware) • Fuel and energy-related activities • Upstream transportation and distribution of purchased and sold products • Waste generated from our operations • Business travel • Employee commuting (including telecommuting) • Upstream leased assets Downstream: • Downstream transportation and distribution of sold products • Direct use of our sold products • End-of-life treatment of sold productsGHG Accounting Methodology51 / 53 2020 Sustainability ReportGHG Accounting Methodology For activity data, we take the quantity of a specific measured activity and multiply it by an associated emission or life cycle factor to calculate the total emissions from that activity.",
,"For example, if we take the kWh of electricity consumed at a Facebook site and apply the appropriate International Energy Agency’s country-specific emission factors, we could calculate the total emissions from that site’s electricity use.",
,"We use activity data to calculate for: To understand cradle-to-gate emissions and/or upfront emissions that are released before certain assets are used (e.g., the emissions released from the production of concrete before it is poured), we conduct third-party LCA studies or utilize LCA tools to measure our impact.",
,"This is applicable in our 2020 inventory for the following emissions: Our Environmentally Extended Input Output (EEIO) method utilizes financial spend data and applies it to industry- specific emission factors (e.g., kg CO2e per dollar spent on electronic manufacturing) published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to get “cradle-to-gate” emissions.",
,"We apply the EEIO method to the following:Activity Data Life Cycle Assessment (LCAs) Financial• Scope 1 and Scope 2 • Fuel and energy-related activities • Waste generated in operations • Business travel (including radiative forcing) • Employee commuting (including electricity and natural gas from telecommuting employees) • Downstream transportation and distribution of sold products • Direct use of sold products • End-of-life treatment of sold products • Upfront emissions associated with the materials used in construction of our data centers • Upfront emissions of materials in office renovations and new construction • Cradle-to-gate emissions from the packaging found in sold products, such as Portal and Oculus devices • Purchased goods and services • Capital goods not related to construction • Upstream transportation and distribution • Upstream leased assets52 / 53 2020 Sustainability ReportGHG Accounting Methodology As Facebook decarbonizes our value chain over the next decade, the data and methodology that drives our climate work will evolve and improve each year.",
,We have disclosed our Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the last 10 years.,
,"We began reporting on some Scope 3 categories in 2015, and have reported on every relevant category defined by the GHG Protocol since 2019.",
,"As techniques to calculate our emissions improve, we will apply those methods to previous years to get a better sense of our footprint.",
,"For example, in 2020 we used the EPA’s updated EEIO emission factors for our Scope 3 calculations and updated our 2019 data accordingly.",
,"Going forward, we will focus on increasing accuracy and granularity of our data.",
,We will use activity data for more emissions categories as methods to do so become available.,
