Emerging carbon pricing regulations to mitigate climate change in some or all of the countries in which we operate could increase Johnson & Johnson’s operating costs.,,,,,
• Market risks of changing customer behavior: Customer preferences are changing because of increased awareness of the impacts of climate change.,,,,,
"This in turn impacts our various businesses in different ways—for example, in 2021, at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), a group of 50 countries committed to develop climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems in response to growing evidence of the impact of climate change on personal health.",,,,,
New procurement policies from health system customers could impact our Pharmaceutical or MedTech business.,,,,,
"Similarly, many customer segments of our Consumer Health business have voiced concerns over the carbon footprint and sustainable sourcing of the products that they procure.",,,,,
"Sustainable sourcing inquiries can include a number of concerns over climate change impacts such as water scarcity, pollution, environmental practices and deforestation.",,,,,
"Failure to effectively communicate sustainability-related improvements with consumers, or failure to provide environmentally/climate change-friendly products, could cede market space to competitors.",,,,,
"• Chronic physical risk associated with changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns: Changes to global climate, extreme temperature and natural disasters could affect demand for Johnson & Johnson’s products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, and force alterations to certain products and operations.",,,,,
"Global warming from the increased concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere is causing frequent extreme temperature conditions, with direct impacts on facilities, operations, transport, and employee health and productivity.",,,,,
"We have identified chronic physical risks—including extreme temperature, water stress and drought—as a substantive strategic climate-based risk to our operations and supply chain that has the potential to cause disruptions in operations or increase operational costs.33 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (continued) Recommended Disclosure External References Disclosure Strategy Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate- related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning where such information is material.",,,,,

Coastal flooding and fluvial flooding were identified as the primary drivers of financial impact on our operations.,,,,,
"As a result of more extreme cyclone, hurricane and storm events and changes in sea level over time, it is likely that both coastal flooding and fluvial flooding will steadily increase.",,,,,
"Description of Opportunities Short-term/Medium-term • Resource efficiency and resilience through the adoption of energy- and water-efficiency measures and the utilization of renewable energy: An increase in cost from climate change regulation can make the capital investment in renewable energy and energy and water efficiency more attractive, which may reduce costs over a longer period of time.",,,,,
"While energy costs as a percent of sales is very low for Johnson & Johnson (<1% in 2021), we continuously evaluate and implement efficiency and renewable energy projects that reduce our energy consumption and costs.",,,,,
"• Development and/ or expansion of low-emission goods and services: With the increase in the general public’s awareness of climate change, the demand for sustainable products is growing each year.",,,,,
"Increasingly, our customers—hospitals, government healthcare systems and retailers—are considering environmental attributes of products in their procurement decisions.",,,,,
"For example, in 2021, at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), a group of 50 countries committed to develop climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems in response to growing evidence of the impact of climate change on people’s health, which could present opportunities for more sustainable products from our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses.",,,,,
"Similar opportunities are increasing within our Consumer Health business, where there is a growing market for responsible products with sustainable packaging and other climate- related product attributes.",,,,,
"Long-term • Development of new products or services through R&D and innovation: According to The Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, the impacts of climate change threaten to undermine decades of progress in healthcare.",,,,,
"Shifting weather patterns, changes in air quality and spread of vector-borne diseases pose significant risks for people’s health and well-being, particularly in resource-limited settings (Africa, Latin America and Asia, where they have the potential to spread more quickly).",,,,,
"We anticipate that climate change could impact the progress society has made in global health in many ways, whether through air pollution, how infectious diseases emerge and spread (including Neglected Tropical Diseases [NTDs] and pandemic threats such as Ebola and Zika) or shifting weather patterns impacting allergies.",,,,,
"Given its far-reaching implications and associated public health costs, combating climate change could be a significant opportunity to protect public health.",,,,,
"Emerging shifts in global disease profiles can be expected to require new products and services to help increase human resilience to disease.34 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (continued) Recommended Disclosure External References Disclosure Strategy Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate- related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning where such information is material.",,,,,

"We define substantive financial risk at the Enterprise level in the context of Securities and Exchange Commission-required disclosures around “Risk Factors, ” which are publicly disclosed annually in our Form 10-K.",,,,,
These risk factors consider both qualitative and quantitative variables in assessing the potential financial impact on the Enterprise.,,,,,
"While climate change can be expected to have profound implications on health for humanity, it is not known with precision the exact magnitude or probability of future risks and how those may impact Johnson & Johnson.",,,,,
"As a result, we use a definition for “substantive strategic impact” that enables us to analyze possible futures and put in place programs to increase the resilience of our organization in the face of uncertainty.",,,,,
"Substantive strategic impacts are disclosed in this Report, which are risks/opportunities with a meaningful impact on reputation and/or public trust, potential for action that could impede Johnson & Johnson from manufacturing or distributing some product volume, and are considered possible, likely, more likely or highly likely in the short- to long-term future.",,,,,
"b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning.",,,,,
"Impacts on businesses and strategy • Products and Services: Risks from climate change could impact products and services in several ways: regulatory risks (e.g., carbon taxes); the availability of raw materials; and supply chain disruptions from chronic or acute physical climate change events that could increase the costs of raw materials and energy.",,,,,
"This could be passed along to the consumer and change the price competitiveness of our products and services, or cause disruptions in supply.",,,,,
"Similarly, there are climate- related opportunities for our business segments as our customers—hospitals, government healthcare systems and retailers—are giving more consideration to environmental attributes of products in their procurement decisions.",,,,,
"We also anticipate that climate change will impact global health in many ways, including how infectious diseases emerge and spread, which may increase the need for new products and services in areas such as NTDs and pandemic preparedness.",,,,,
Our Health for Humanity Goals and ESG strategy address several aspects of these risks.,,,,,
"To address price competitiveness specifically related to energy, we are implementing goals to reduce our emissions (e.g., our Science Based Target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 by 60% by 2030 from a 2016 baseline), which has energy- saving implications.",,,,,
"• Supply Chain and/ or Value Chain: We believe that improving supply chain transparency and sustainability creates value by reducing sourcing risks and protecting our brand reputation, and can have far-reaching positive impacts on society and the natural environment.",,,,,
"As the world’s largest and most broadly based healthcare company, Johnson & Johnson maintains operations in many countries of the world and works with more than 45,000 suppliers across our three business segments.",,,,,
We manage a highly complex network of supplier relationships that are critical to business success and our ability to fulfill our obligations to those we serve.,,,,,
Risks from climate change could impact our supply chain in several ways: regulatory risks that could increase the cost of materials used in our products; physical risks (such as droughts and extreme weather events) that have the potential to interrupt supply chains; and reputational risks that could arise from climate issues in our supply chain.,,,,,
"Our Health for Humanity Goals address sustainable procurement from multiple angles, including reporting and performance.",,,,,

"This assessment covers short-, medium-, and long-term horizons and is integrated into the Johnson & Johnson Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework .",,,,,
"The Johnson & Johnson ERM framework helps identify potential events that may affect the Enterprise, manage the associated risks and opportunities, and provide reasonable assurance that our Company’s objectives will be achieved.",,,,,
Our approach to ERM is informed by principles outlined by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.,,,,,
Climate-related risks are integrated into this Company-wide risk management process.,,,,,
The Johnson & Johnson ERM Framework comprises five intertwined components: 1) Strategy & objective-setting: The Executive Committee (EC) establishes overarching strategic goals and sets financial targets based upon our Global Growth Drivers.,,,,,
"These goals are cascaded to our businesses around the world, ensuring alignment across the Enterprise.",,,,,
Senior management is accountable for meeting these goals and objectives.,,,,,
"Business unit, Enterprise function and individual employee goals and objectives are typically aligned to those of the overall organization.",,,,,
2) Performance: Internal and external issues and events affecting our ability to achieve established objectives are typically identified at various points in the business cycle.,,,,,
"During planning and review processes, business unit management assesses the marketplace and competitive environment, including megatrends, to identify risks and opportunities facing their business.",,,,,
"The various ERM functions provide expertise, support and input into the process as needed.",,,,,

"4) Information, Communication & Reporting: Information and communication channels are in place, so business leaders and employees are aware of risks that fall into their area of responsibility.",,,,,

,"By the end of 2019, while we were seeing only the first glimpses of the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it was already evident just how necessary it was to mobilize resources on a global scale when combating outbreaks of infectious disease.",,,,
,"At Johnson & Johnson, the best way forward in meeting our commitments to transparency and sustainability—last year, this year, and for many years to come—remains crystal clear.",,,,
,"Simply put, we are constantly taking stock of what we are doing to help keep people healthy so that they can thrive in healthy communities on a healthy planet and prioritizing those actions that will have the greatest impact.",,,,
,"We know this mission will always be unfinished, and that we will occasionally fall short.",,,,
,But that only serves as motivation to move faster than we’ve ever moved before in making bigger strides toward some of our most ambitious goals.,,,,
,"And as we’ve detailed in this Report, we have plenty of positive momentum worth recognizing.",,,,
,"Key achievements included: victories in our work toward a world without disease, such as major strides in preventing HIV and combating Ebola and TB; acceleration of patient- centric innovation, like new 3D-printed implants designed to regenerate, rather than replace, diseased joints; and robust ongoing work to improve our communities, strengthen the frontline health workforce and safeguard the planet, including accelerating the reduction of our carbon footprint with four new contracts for renewably sourced electricity in Belgium, Ireland, Mexico and the Netherlands.",,,,
,"Importantly, we were able to do all of the above (and more) thanks to a culture of accountability, transparency and ethical behavior that, to me, make up the very definition of a healthy company.",,,,
,"As you’ll see, this year’s Report highlights areas where we’ve already achieved our Health for Humanity 2020 Goals and our UN Sustainable Development Goals commitments, as well as areas where we’re redoubling our efforts.",,,,
,The most essential feature of public reports like this must always be to critically assess how we’re doing—not just spotlight our greatest successes.,,,,
,"If 2019 taught me anything, it’s that turbulent times require us to not just reaffirm but deepen our pledge to account for how we meet the long-term needs of patients, consumers, mothers and fathers, our communities, and our planet—a sentiment shared by more and more CEOs.",,,,
,"Initiatives like last year’s update of the Business Roundtable Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation, which we were honored to help steer, affirmed unequivocally that there is a fundamental connection between serving all stakeholders and generating sustainable, long-term value.",,,,
,"The demands for global healthcare and responsible corporate citizenship will only continue to increase, and meeting them will require us to not only operate with speed and agility, but with focus and determination.",,,,
,"The start of this new year has already seen us launching a huge, multi-pronged and collaborative response to combat COVID-19, the details of which can be found at: www.jnj.com/ coronavirus.",,,,
,"I have many reasons to be optimistic that we can and will succeed in meeting our most critical commitments—more than 137,000 of them, in fact.",,,,
,That’s the number of talented Johnson & Johnson employees around the world whose passion and dedication serve as the ultimate engine for change.,,,,
,"I’m immensely proud to be sharing this journey with them, and confident that all of us will do whatever it takes to deliver on our Company’s promises to our patients and consumers, our communities, and our world.",,,,

,"Health Workforce, Women’s and Children’s Health Many of our programs are co-funded, and while we make every effort to report only beneficiaries/healthcare professionals reached by our portion of the program, sometimes that is not possible.",,,,
,"We do not have a direct line of sight to the data collection processes, as the data are gathered by our partners on the ground.",,,,
,"Some of our partners have data quality assurance protocols, but some do not.",,,,
,"For the purposes of our reporting, we assume each pregnant woman bears one infant—we do not use an estimation factor to discount for stillbirths or add for multiple births.",,,,
,"For our goals, we count the number of individuals reached per year, aggregated over five years.",,,,
,"This means that for some multi- year programs, where a similar population of individuals is reached but the data systems are not strong enough to track each individual’s interaction with the program over the years, we do not always report unique individuals reached.",,,,
,"We also do not have 100% reporting as some data come in after organizational publication deadlines, which means we may have some undercounting.",,,,
,"To remedy this, we have reduced the amount of time the partners have to report post- project completion.",,,,
,"However, because of their organizational processes and difficulties obtaining timely data from remote areas in some cases, some partners report after our auditing deadline.",,,,
,Their data are reported in subsequent years.,,,,
,Essential Surgery A large part of the data and progress for this goal comes from the work we undertake with the Medical and Surgical Skills Institute (MSSI) in Ghana.,,,,
,"The MSSI reports the numbers, nationalities and disciplines of medical professionals that complete each MSSI course.",,,,
,"However, estimating the number of patients benefiting from the skills and knowledge obtained in a course requires the use of estimates and extrapolations to account for the number of patients treated per week, potential duplicate visits (e.g., same patient being seen by a doctor and a nurse trained by the MSSI), and the retention time for the knowledge gained.",,,,
,"We use conservative estimates for knowledge retention (one year) and have not included the potential multiplier effect of the “train-the- trainer” progression, where trained medical professionals go on to train others.",,,,
,"To further assess the methodology and the rates used to calculate patient beneficiaries, in 2019, the MSSI added two questions to the evaluation survey it conducts with medical professionals after each course.",,,,
,The two questions added were: 1) How many patients do you see on average in a week?,,,,
,and 2) How many patients per week would benefit from the skills learned in this course?,,,,
,"The surveys covered 124 MSSI courses and involved 2,013 individual respondents.",,,,
,The data from the survey were of good quality and consistent with Ghana health dynamics.,,,,
,The survey results substantiated the rates used by the MSSI.,,,,
,"Consequently, we can confidently state that in 2019, MSSI training benefited 18.6 million patients across West Africa.",,,,
,"Global Disease Challenges When it comes to quantifying the progress against this goal, a large part of the data comes from the number of VERMOX doses donated, measured through the number of doses shipped.",,,,
,Historical data show that about 80% – 90% of the children targeted for treatment in endemic countries receive two treatments each year.,,,,
,We thus have used a factorial of 1.6 – 1.8 to estimate the number of children treated each year.,,,,
,The number of children treated estimated for 2016 was based on the factorial of 1.6.,,,,
,For 2017 – 2019 the figure is based on the factorial of 1.8.,,,,
,Environmental Health Success in achieving the desired impact for this goal depends on C40 city members initiating climate actions by the end of 2020.,,,,
,"In order to achieve the scale of impact, actions need to be ambitious and, therefore, take time to develop and implement.",,,,
,C40 is working with the current administrations of their city members to support their planned actions.,,,,
,"However, there is always a risk that actions do not get implemented or are altered in scale and ambition because of changes in city circumstances (e.g., political or funding changes).",,,,
,"We will aim to manage this risk by focusing on ambitious actions with larger-scale impact spread across a number of cities, conducting careful vetting of proposed projects and making city participation as easy as possible.",,,,
,"When the Environmental Health goal was established in late 2016, a qualifier was placed on the original target of 100 million citizens living across 30 cities.",,,,
,"As we noted at the time, those potential figures were to be revised once cities and actions were confirmed with C40 Cities.",,,,
,"In 2018, these details were confirmed and the number of potential citizens benefiting was revised to 60 million over the five-year goal.",,,,

,This decision expands the use of bedaquiline in shorter treatment regimens to replace injectable agents.,,,,
,"WHO advised national TB programs to phase out the use of injectable- containing short-course regimens, which have been known to cause toxic side effects for patients.",,,,
,"The Rapid Communication was released in advance of updated consolidated drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) treatment guidelines, expected in 2020, to help national TB programs to begin planning for a rapid transition to what WHO describes as “more effective, less toxic and easier to implement” regimens.",,,,
,"Expanding treatment to young people: In 2019, we secured U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for bedaquiline tablets as part of combination therapy for eligible MDR-TB patients aged 12 years and over in the United States.",,,,

,"Our assurance activities Our objective was to assess whether the assured emission data are reported in accordance with the principles of completeness, comparability (across the organisation) and accuracy (including calculations, use of appropriate conversion factors and consolidation).",,,,
,We planned and performed our work to obtain all the information and explanations that we believe were necessary to provide a basis for our assurance conclusions.,,,,

,"A team of GHG and assurance specialists performed the following key activities: • Virtual interviews with relevant staff to understand internal reporting processes, including the use of its GHG Management Plan, internal spreadsheets, and its various internal data management and reporting systems;• A review of samples of primary data such as invoices; • A review of the calculations undertaken, including conversion factors and emission factors used; • A review of estimates, extrapolations and assumptions made in relation to the data for relevant GHG Scope 3 categories; and • An analytical review of the consolidated year end data for each metric.",,,,
,"The limitations of our engagement The reliability of the assured information is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for determining, calculating or estimating the underlying information.",,,,

,"Our independent assurance statement provides no assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in particular whether any changes may have occurred to the information since it was first published.",,,,
,Our observations We have provided Johnson & Johnson with a separate management report with our detailed (non-material) findings and recommendations.,,,,
,"Without affecting the conclusions presented above, we have the following key observation: • Johnson & Johnson should document both qualitatively and quantitatively their uncertainty information for each GHG Scope 3 category, and describe their efforts to record uncertainty in future revisions of the Scope 3 emissions inventory.",,,,

,,,,"A multi-disciplinary team of environmental and assurance specialists performed the following activities: • Virtual interviews with relevant corporate staff to understand internal reporting guidance and processes, including the use of its GHG Management Plan, internal spreadsheets, and its various internal data management and reporting systems for each of the metrics in scope; • Review of reporting boundary compared to J&J’s internal reporting criteria • Virtual site visits to eight sites (Bangkok, Thailand; Ciudad Juarez, Mexico; Beerse, Belgium; Ft. Washington, U.S.; San Angelo, U.S., Cork, Ireland; South Holland, The Netherlands; Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil (desk-based)) to review local reporting processes and consistency of reported annual data with selected underlying source data for each indicator.",
,,,,"We interviewed relevant staff, reviewed site data capture and reporting methods, checked calculations and assessed the local internal quality and assurance processes; • A review of a sample of primary data for each metric in scope; • A review of the calculations undertaken, including conversion factors and emission factors used; • A review of estimates, extrapolations, and assumptions made in relation to the data for relevant GHG Scope 3 emissions categories; and • An analytical review of the consolidated year end data for each metric.The limitations of our engagement The reliability of the assured information is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for determining, calculating or estimating the underlying information.",
,,,,It is important to understand our assurance conclusions in this context.,
,,,,"Our independent assurance statement provides no assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in particular whether any changes may have occurred to the information since it was first published.",
