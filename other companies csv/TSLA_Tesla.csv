"Today, we build not only all-electric vehicles but also inﬁnitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products.",,,
"We believe the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emissions future, the better.",,,
"Tesla’s products o ffer a complete solution – sustainable generation, storage and usage – all capable of being powered by the sun.",,,
"We envision a world powered by solar energy, running on batteries and transported by all-electric cars.",,,
"By design, Tesla’s products are sustainable, and we’re working hard to build them in a sustainable way too.",,,
We’re publishing our very ﬁrst Impact Report measuring the impacts of our products and operations on the environment and our communities.,,,
We recognize there’s still much to be done.,,,
"As we grow and prove to the world that a business rooted in sustainability can also be successful, we will continue to improve our processes and report on our progress in future Impact Reports.",,,
THE TESLA TEAM04MISSION Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.,,,
Climate change is reaching alarming levels – in large part due to emissions from burning fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation.,,,
"In 2016, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration levels permanently exceeded the 400 parts per million threshold, a level that many climate scientists believe will have a catastrophic impact on the environment.",,,
"Worse, global CO2 emissions are increasing at an accelerating rate.",,,
Annual CO2 emissions have approximately doubled over the past 50 years to over 35 gigatons per year.,,,
The path that the world currently is on is unsustainable and unwise.,,,
The world cannot reduce CO2 emissions without addressing energy generation and consumption.,,,
And the world cannot address its energy habits without directly reducing emissions in the transportation and power sectors.,,,
This issue is Tesla’s entire reason for existing.,,,
We are focused on creating a complete power and transportation ecosystem from solar generation and energy storage to all-electric vehicles.,,,
"The ﬁrst step in our Master Plan was to build an all-electric sports car (the Tesla Roadster) to prove that people didn’t need to compromise performance, speed or comfort to drive all-electric.",,,
"From there, we designed the world’s ﬁrst-ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up, Model S , our Model X SUV, and an a ffordable vehicle for the mass market, Model 3 .",,,
"As part of Master Plan, Part Deux , we introduced Tesla Semi , an all-electric truck that delivers massive savings in energy costs, performance, e fficiency and reliability.GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS BY ECONOMIC SECTOR Agriculture, Forestry & Other Land Use24% Industry21% Other Energy10%Electricity & Heat Production*25% Buildings 6%Transportation * 14%Global GHG emissions are increasing at an accelerating rate.",,,
Annual GHG emissions have approximately doubled over the past 50 years to over 35 gigatons per year.,,,
Energy use through electricity and heat production (25%) and transportation (14%) together drive these GHG emissions.,,,
"*Tesla-related sectorsMISSION 05 IMPACT REPORTWe recognize that we cannot achieve our mission alone, so we decided to open source Tesla patents , making them accessible to anyone who wants to design and build electric vehicles.",,,
"To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy products that enable homeowners, businesses and utilities to produce and manage renewable energy generation, storage and consumption.",,,
"Homeowners can install solar panels or Solar Roof to power their home using 100% renewable energy and store that energy in Powerwall , which makes electricity available during peak energy-use periods to help them save money and provides power during grid outages.",,,
"Meanwhile, utilities and businesses can use Powerpack – an inﬁnitely scalable energy storage system that provides greater control, e fficiency and reliability across the electric grid.",,,
Renewable energy generation and storage are critical components of developing microgrids — an increasingly important means of delivering reliable and sustainable electricity around the world.,,,
"As deployment of Tesla’s products continues to accelerate, we can scale the adoption of renewable energy, cost-e ffectively modernize our aging infrastructure (and become less reliant on it) and improve the resilience of the electric grid to beneﬁt everyone.",,,
"Combined with a 13 MW photovoltaic array, the 52 MWh Powerpack system in Kaua’i stores solar energy captured during the day and feeds it to the grid to help reduce the amount of diesel power generation needed to meet the island’s electricity demand.",,,
This system is helping the Kaua’i Island Utility Cooperative meet its goal of using renewable resources to generate at least half of the island’s electricity by the end of 2019.,,,
01 PRODUCT IMPACT 06 07 IMPACT REPORT 07The foundation of Tesla’s mission rests ﬁrst and foremost on our products.,,,
"Our focus from the beginning has been to develop products that are not only sustainable, but superior to fossil-fuel alternatives, as many believe that choosing sustainable products requires consumers to compromise on price or performance.",,,
"Tesla’s all-electric vehicles combine performance, safety and e fficiency, making them the best cars in the world, while Tesla’s energy generation and storage products power both urban and remote communities with reliable, a ffordable energy.",,,
"Transportation and electricity production are two of the largest sources of GHG emissions, making up more than half of all U.S. emissions.",,,
"Tesla’s ecosystem (solar, batteries and vehicles) aims to reduce the environmental impacts of transportation, electricity production and energy use by people, homes, businesses and the grid.",,,
"In 2006, prior to the launch of the Tesla Roadster, there was no viable all-electric vehicle option on the market.",,,
"Now, 12 years later, there are over 3M electric vehicles on the road globally, with more being produced every day.",,,
"The auto industry is moving towards electriﬁcation, and governments around the world have recognized the harmful impact of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle emissions and have started to take concrete steps towards making the future more environmentally friendly and sustainable.Powerwall is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that integrates with solar to store excess energy generated during the day and make electricity available when homeowners need it — for example, during grid outages and when the sun is not shining.ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IMPACT REPORTSUSTAINABLE AND SUPERIOR PRODUCTS FOR EVERYONE 08ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTOver 550K Tesla vehicles have been sold, and they have driven over 10B miles to date, resulting in a combined savings of over 4M metric tons of CO2.",,,
This is the equivalent of saving emissions from being released into the environment from over 500K ICE vehicles with a fuel economy of 22 miles per gallon (MPG).,,,
"Tesla’s Supercharger network — the fastest and most extensive charging network in the world — has delivered over 595 Gigawatt- hours (GWhs) of energy, saving the equivalent of over 75M gallons of gasoline.",,,
That’s enough gasoline for the average ICE vehicle with a fuel economy of 22 MPG to travel round trip from Los Angeles to New York City over 290K times.,,,
"As of February 2019, Tesla Energy has installed over 3.5 Gigawatts of solar installations and has cumulatively generated over 13 Terawatt- hours (TWhs) of 100% clean, emissions-free electricity.",,,
"To put 13 TWhs in perspective, this amount of energy could supply the annual residential electricity consumption for the entire state of Connecticut.",,,
"Over their entire expected use life of 35+ years, these solar installations are expected to generate 86.5 TWh of energy, which is enough electricity to power all of Washington D.C. for almost a decade.4,000,000+ Metric tons of CO2 saved 10,000,000,000+ Miles driven Tesla vehicles sold550,000+ Tesla began delivering its ﬁrst mass- market vehicle, Model 3, in July 2017.",,,
"Like every Tesla, Model 3 combines range, performance, safety and technology — accelerating from 0-60 mph in a mere 3.2 seconds.ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT The World Health Organization estimates greenhouse gases and harmful air pollutants, such as particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, cause over 7M premature deaths around the globe each year.",,,
"Reducing the use of fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and stroke in both developed and undeveloped countries.",,,
"While many recognize the impact that power generation has on CO2 emissions, power generation’s impact on water consumption is less appreciated.",,,
"Power generation is one of the leading causes of water withdrawal in the U.S., as water for thermoelectric power is used in generating electricity with steam-driven turbine generators and also to cool the power-producing equipment.",,,
"So every kilowatt-hour (kWh) of clean solar energy produced not only lowers CO2 emissions, but also lowers water consumption.ALL-TIME TESLA ENERGY CONSUMPTION VS. GENERATION MODEL S, X AND 3 ENERGY CONSUMPTION TESLA SOLAR ENERGY GENERATION TWh 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 9 11 125.26 TWh 13Telsa’s solar electricity generation has far exceeded the amount of energy the entire Tesla vehicle ﬂeet on the road has consumed to date.",,,
"09 IMPACT REPORT13.25 TWhRESILIENCE OF THE GRID Tesla batteries combined with existing solar arrays on the island of Culebra in Puerto Rico provide clean energy for communities nearby.Solar and energy storage systems don’t just provide clean, zero- emission energy, they also improve the reliability and resilience of the electric grid.",,,
"For example, in the event of an electric grid outage, energy storage systems can immediately provide power to homes, communities and businesses.",,,
"When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in September 2017, destroying thousands of homes and cutting electric grid power on the island, the initial emergency response was focused on deploying diesel generators to provide temporary electricity.",,,
"In addition to releasing harmful emissions and requiring constant refueling and maintenance, these generators were extremely loud and not designed to run for long periods, so many failed.",,,
"In response, Tesla provided over 1K battery storage systems paired with solar panels to deliver reliable and emissions-free electricity to over 660 locations throughout Puerto Rico, such as the Hospital del Niño Children’s Hospital in San Juan.",,,
"10In addition to providing back-up power during an electric grid outage, the combination of solar and energy storage systems provides communities the ﬂexibility of using the solar power when needed.",,,
"Battery energy storage systems also smooth out the variable peaks and valleys in electricity demand , thus reducing both peak demand costs and the operational costs for utilities of generating power during peak periods.",,,
"This solution is also offsetting the need to overbuild infrastructure , such as peaker power plants — some of the world’s dirtiest and least stable polluting energy generators — to meet the highest demand hours of the year.",,,
"In December 2017, Tesla turned on the world’s largest lithium-ion battery in South Australia .",,,
"A 50-year storm had damaged critical infrastructure in this region, causing a statewide blackout and leaving 1.7M residents without electricity.",,,
"As a result, the local government looked for a sustainable solution to ensure energy security for all residents, and Tesla, with the developer, Neoen, were selected to work on this project.",,,
Tesla provided a 100 MW / 129 MWh Powerpack system to be paired with Neoen’s Hornsdale Wind Farm near Jamestown and completed the project in less than 100 days .,,,
"Just a few weeks after, when a major coal-ﬁred power plant failed, Tesla’s battery system was activated in mere milliseconds to help stabilize the electric grid.",,,
This grid scale energy storage project is an example of a zero-emissions solution that is helping to reduce power outages and improving the reliability of South Australia’s electrical infrastructure.,,,
"Powerpacks in South Australia charge using wind energy from the Hornsdale Wind Farm — providing not only a sustainable solution to the region’s energy needs, but also helping to solve power shortages, reduce intermittencies and manage summer electricity peak load to improve the infrastructure’s reliability.RESILIENCE OF THE GRID 11 IMPACT REPORTACCESS TO SUSTAINABLE ENERGYMore than 1B people worldwide do not have access to electricity, and many that do get their electricity from polluting sources such as coal or fossil fuels.",,,
Tesla is bringing sustainable and a ffordable energy solutions to communities around the world.,,,
"On the island of Ta’u in American Samoa , Tesla created a microgrid consisting of over 5.3K solar panels and 60 Powerpack systems, which is capable of powering 100% of the island on clean energy for 3 full days without sun.",,,
"Today, instead of burning almost 110K gallons of diesel per year, paying for rising fuel and related transportation costs and having to face negative health impacts, nearly 900 residents of Ta’u beneﬁt from clean, affordable and reliable energy year round.",,,
"3 days of energy without the sun100% coverage of the island1.4 MW of solar generation Ta’u Island in American Samoa used diesel generators as their main source of power for many years, leaving the residents vulnerable to blackouts when diesel supplies were low.",,,
"To solve this, Tesla paired solar with Powerpacks to power homes, schools, the local hospital and other facilities to deliver 100% clean energy around the clock to the entire community.",,,
"12The National Highway Tra ffic Safety Administration awarded Model 3 a 5-star safety rating in every category and sub- category, making it one of the safest cars on the road.",,,
"FRONTAL CRASH ROLLOVERSIDE CRASH OVERALL RATINGMODEL 3 SPOTLIGHTBUILDING THE SAFEST CARS FROM THE GROUND UPImproving occupant safety has always been key to our mission, because vehicle safety is essential to mass all-electric vehicle adoption .",,,
"When we set out to build our ﬁrst full-sized vehicle, Model S, we positioned the battery pack and electric motors beneath the ﬂoor of the vehicle to give it an extremely low center of gravity, greatly reducing the risk of rollover while enhancing handling and performance.",,,
"Today, all Tesla vehicles feature this same battery placement.",,,
Another beneﬁt of Tesla vehicles is improved frontal impact safety due to our vehicles’ front trunk.,,,
The entire front end of the vehicle becomes a superior crumple zone since there is no gasoline engine block.,,,
"This design improves impact absorption in the event of a crash, and the area doubles as an extra storage space.",,,
"Beneath our vehicles, the titanium underbody shield consists of a ¼-inch ballistic grade aluminum armor plate that protects the battery pack.",,,
"Based on the advanced architecture of Model S and Model X, we engineered Model 3 to be the safest car built to date.",,,
"In addition to its near 50/50 weight distribution, Model 3 was also designed with an extremely low polar moment of inertia, meaning its heaviest components are located closer to the car’s center of gravity.",,,
"Even though Model 3 has no engine, its performance is similar to a “mid- engine car” due to its centered battery pack and the fact that Model 3’s rear motor is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather than behind it.",,,
"Not only does this architecture add to the overall agility and handling of the car, it also improves the capability of stability control by minimizing rotational kinetic energy.",,,
"After testing Model 3 as part of its New Car Assessment Program through a series of crash tests used to calculate the likelihood of serious bodily injury for front, side and rollover crashes, the National Highway Tra ffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) awarded Model 3 a perfect 5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category .",,,
"13 IMPACT REPORTLOWEST ROLLOVER RISKFRONT-IMPACT PROTECTION SIDE-IMPACT PROTECTIONOur commitment to safety is why all Tesla vehicles built since October 2016 come with a suite of external cameras, sensors and onboard computing that enable advanced safety features like Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Forward and Side Collision Warning, Obstacle-Aware Acceleration, blind spot warnings and more.",,,
"These features are made possible by our Autopilot hardware and software system, which is an advanced driver assistance tool that provides an additional layer of safety that two eyes alone would not have and helps make highway driving more enjoyable.",,,
"We believe that the unique combination of passive safety, active safety, and automated driving is crucial for keeping not just Tesla drivers and passengers safe, but all drivers on the road.",,,
"In Q1 2019 , we registered one accident for every 2.87M miles driven in which drivers had Autopilot engaged.",,,
"For those driving without Autopilot, we registered one accident for every 1.76M miles driven.",,,
"By comparison, NHTSA’s most recent data shows that in the United States there is an automobile crash every 436K miles.All new Tesla vehicles have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.",,,
"Eight surround cameras provide 360° visibility around the car, complemented by 12 ultrasonic sensors.",,,
"A 250-meter forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the car’s surroundings on a redundant wavelength that is able to see through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead.BUILDING THE SAFEST CARS FROM THE GROUND UP 14 02 OPERATIONAL IMPACT 15 IMPACT REPORT0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) INVENTORYWhile the everyday use of Tesla products by consumers has by far the biggest environmental impact, we also care deeply about operating our business and manufacturing our products in a sustainable way.",,,
"Tesla has expanded its global manufacturing, charging, sales and service footprint rapidly in recent years.",,,
Keeping track of our various operational impacts allows us to implement e fficiency improvements that simultaneously reduce our impact on the environment and lower operational costs.,,,
Global CO2 levels in the atmosphere are higher than ever.,,,
It is an unsustainable trend that drives Tesla’s mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.,,,
"In 2017, Tesla established a baseline global carbon impact footprint across manufacturing, retail, distribution, sales, Supercharger, energy, warehouse and o ffice facilities.",,,
"For this baseline year, Tesla focused on tracking electricity and natural gas usage for our sites.",,,
"Moving forward, we will continue to build out this data, which will help us set speciﬁc targets with the goal of driving down our GHG footprint on a per- product basis as we continue to grow our business.",,,

"In our Fremont Factory, the installation of LED lighting, as well as efficiency improvements to manufacturing systems such as compressed air, castings, injection molding, water test booth and cooling towers, combined with a new energy-efficient paint shop, have resulted in over 10 GWhs of energy savings over the last 5 years.",,,
These savings are the equivalent of the annual electricity consumption of almost 1K U.S. households.,,,
"As a result of many improvements, the energy usage at the Fremont Factory per vehicle manufactured has decreased by 19% compared to 2016.",,,
"In 2017, we established our energy-use baseline for the Fremont Factory.",,,
We have started the process of gathering energy intensity data for all of our main manufacturing locations and plan to add that information to the Impact Report in the future.,,,
ENERGY EFFICIENCY 17 IMPACT REPORTSustainability is at the heart of everything we do.,,,
"In the same way our customers are adopting zero-emissions lifestyles by using solar energy systems, battery storage and all-electric vehicles, Tesla is also installing sustainable energy systems at our own facilities to utilize renewable energy generation and storage where possible.",,,
"As we continue to ramp production of Tesla products, we are committed to making signiﬁcant progress towards our goal of operating global Tesla manufacturing, vehicle charging and other operations using 100% renewable energy.SUSTAINABLE ENERGY18Tesla purchased the Fremont plant in 2010 and completed a signiﬁcant $3 billion modernization of the site to create one of the most advanced manufacturing facilities in the world.",,,
"Originally built in the 1960s, the Fremont Factory contains 5.3M sq ft of manufacturing and o ffice space — the equivalent of over 90 American football ﬁelds.",,,
"The original roof layout and building infrastructure make solar deployment on-site challenging, but our long-term plan is to install rooftop solar panels at this site where possible.",,,
"The Fremont Factory is also home to one of our ﬁrst battery installations, originally commissioned in 2015.",,,
The Fremont Factory battery pack system monitors the facility’s energy use throughout the day and cuts back the amount of electricity taken from the grid during peak hours.,,,
"This also helps to decrease demand on the local electric grid in addition to reducing the facility’s energy costs, as electricity purchased during peak hours is priced at a premium.",,,
"FREMONT FACTORY PRODUCT Powerpack Battery1 MW / 2 MWh APPLICATION Peak Shaving Tesla builds every Model S, Model X and Model 3 at its factory in Fremont, where some vehicle components are also manufactured.",,,
"In addition to the 10K+ employees at this factory, hundreds of robots are located throughout the facility, including on the Model 3 production line.Opened in 2013, Tesla’s Tilburg Factory in the Netherlands spans 11-acres, houses a rooftop solar array and features an indoor driving track, quality control stations and several assembly lines.Tesla’s Tilburg Factory in the Netherlands serves as the local assembly, quality testing and distribution point for Model S and Model X vehicles sold in the European Union (EU).",,,
The Tilburg Factory houses a 3.4 MW solar array that consists of almost 10.5K solar modules.,,,
This solar system generates enough electricity to meet the Tilburg Factory’s energy needs throughout most of the year.,,,
"To put the magnitude of the installation in perspective, it is the size of almost 3 European football ﬁelds and between July 2017 to June 2018 generated an amount of electricity that would have been su fficient to power 942 households in the region.",,,
"In other words, the solar power captured by this system from that same time period would be su fficient to meet the energy needs for electric vehicles to drive a combined total of over 16.7M km (10.4M miles).",,,
"TILBURG FACTORY LATHROP FACTORY With 431K sq ft of manufacturing space, Tesla’s Lathrop facility in California hosts computer numerical control (CNC) operations, machining and castings manufacturing.",,,
"Located 50 miles from our Fremont Factory, the Lathrop facility features an installed battery operation that helps reduce peak energy consumption, alleviating stress on the electricity grid during heavy-use times and minimizing the dependence on peaker power plants.",,,
"PRODUCT Powerpack Battery2 MW / 4 MWh APPLICATION Peak Shaving PRODUCT Solar Array3.4 MW APPLICATION Facility’s Energy Needs 19 IMPACT REPORTUnlike our Fremont Factory which was purchased and renovated, Tesla designed and built from the ground up our Gigafactory 1, a battery and motor manufacturing facility in Sparks, Nevada, allowing us to design and implement sustainable solutions throughout the site from the beginning.",,,
Gigafactory 1 began mass production of lithium-ion battery cells in January 2017 and started manufacturing Model 3 battery packs and drive units in mid-2018.,,,
"At 15M sq ft, Gigafactory 1 will be the world's largest building by footprint when completed and will eventually be powered by 100% renewable energy sources.",,,
Tesla built Gigafactory 1 with an e fficient lighting design utilizing high-e fficiency LED light ﬁxtures combined with an optimized layout that reduces the facility’s overall electrical load.,,,
"Gigafactory 1’s current lighting power density is 0.45 watts per sq ft, which is 65% less than the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) lighting design allowance of 1.3 watts per sq ft for a manufacturing facility.",,,
"In the course of 30 days, the facility’s lighting system can save 144 MWhs of energy – enough energy for a Model S to drive 480K miles.",,,
"Designed to be a net-zero energy factory upon completion, the facility will have the largest rooftop solar array in the world, with roughly 200K solar panels.",,,
"Solar installation is already underway, in addition to a microgrid R&D facility.",,,
"GIGAFACTORY 1 Tesla’s Gigafactory 2 in Bu ffalo, New York, is located on the remediated RiverBend brownﬁeld site that was previously home to Republic Steel until its closure in 1984.",,,
"As an abandoned heavy industrial site, the land suffered from a long history of extensive environmental contamination and required signiﬁcant rehabilitation before being put to its new use.",,,
"During Gigafactory 2’s construction, old steel manufacturing debris removed from the site included everything from old rail boxcars to contaminated slag in the soil.",,,
"Now, the brownﬁeld is restored and home to a new 1.2M sq ft clean energy manufacturing complex where Tesla’s solar energy products are made.",,,
"The facility is symbolic of the comprehensive clean up and transformation of the adjacent Bu ffalo River, which is now valued as an environmental, economic and community resource.GIGAFACTORY 2 20PRODUCT Under constructionSolar Array APPLICATION Facility’s Energy NeedsSTATE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDSTesla’s manufacturing facilities in California (Fremont Factory), Nevada (Gigafactory 1) and New York (Gigafactory 2) are located within some of the cleanest electricity grid mixes and most aggressive Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) Policies in the U.S.",,,

"In 2012, we opened our very ﬁrst Supercharger station and have since deployed over 12K Superchargers, building out the world’s fastest and most extensive charging network for Tesla vehicle owners.",,,
"Superchargers are strategically placed to allow owners to take long road trips with minimal stops and are located near restaurants, co ffee shops, markets and other convenient amenities.",,,
"With charging speeds up to 120 kW, the typical driver charges for about 30 minutes before continuing their journey.",,,
"While the electricity grid varies from region to region, charging electric vehicles is cleaner than ever.",,,
"In the U.S., coal has historically been the dominant energy source for generating electricity, but in the last decade, coal power has declined signiﬁcantly.",,,
"Instead, energy generated by sustainable sources has grown rapidly, accounting for an estimated 70% of new electric generation capacity in 2017.",,,
Many U.S. states have been making signiﬁcant investments in new renewable energy resources now that they are competitively priced with fossil fuel resources.,,,
"For example, California generated approximately 30% of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources in 2017, up from 12% in 2009, and the state is targeting 60% by 2030.",,,
"To put this in perspective, GHG emissions from charging an average all-electric vehicle in the U.S. is equivalent to the emissions that would be produced by a conventional ICE vehicle that gets a fuel economy of 80 MPG.",,,
"Keep in mind, the average ICE vehicle gets around 22 MPG.SUPERCHARGERS Superchargers globally12,800+ 99% U.S. population within 150 miles of a Supercharger36 Countries with SuperchargersSupercharger Stations1,400+ 40-stall Supercharger station in Kettleman City, California with solar panels.",,,
"22Even when electric vehicles are charged in regions that derive much of their electricity from the burning of fossil fuels, the electricity production needed to charge electric vehicles is still considerably less harmful to the environment than ﬁlling up an ICE vehicle gas tank.",,,
"For example, as of July 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center, even in Texas — one of the states with the highest amount of electricity coming from fossil fuels at 75% — emissions related to the production of electricity used in electric vehicles are still over 22% lower than gasoline cars and almost 5% lower than plug-in hybrid vehicles.",,,
"In states with a much higher proportion of electricity generated from renewable energy generation, such as California, the e ffect of lower emissions from driving electric vehicles as compared to gasoline or plug-in hybrid vehicles is far greater.",,,
"The reality is that while burning gasoline won’t get cleaner, driving on electricity continues to get cleaner — all while delivering immediate health and environmental beneﬁts.",,,
"Governments around the world are recognizing the harmful impact of ICE vehicle emissions, with Norway, India, France and others aiming to ban sales of ICE vehicles as soon as the next decade.",,,
"As more regions adopt sustainable energy solutions, emissions related to electric vehicle charging will decrease even further.",,,
"All Tesla vehicles produce signiﬁcantly less CO2 than any gasoline-powered competitor – and if an electric vehicle is powered by solar energy, essentially no CO2 is produced at all.",,,
"In the EU, where Tesla has the option to select local energy providers, over 85% of energy delivered by our Superchargers is produced by clean, low-carbon energy sources, including solar, wind and hydropower.",,,
"In the future, as we continue to expand our global charging network, our goal is to strategically pair solar and battery storage at as many Supercharger stations as possible.SUPERCHARGERS Tesla’s Supercharger station in Arlington, Texas.STATE OF TEXAS ANNUAL EMISSIONS PER VEHICLE (LBS OF C02 EQUIVALENT) 0 5K 10K Gasoline12K Hybrid6.5K All Electric 5KPlug-in Hybrid 7K 23 IMPACT REPORT24The Fremont Factory was originally home to General Motors (GM) from 1962-82, and then GM and Toyota’s partnership, New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.

"This 50:1 densiﬁcation ratio converts a commodity we previously had to pay to get rid of into a revenue-generating recyclable.Plastic recycled at Fremont in 2017, a 9% year-over-year increase despite challenges in the global market for recycled plastics.2,900 tonsPounds of organics sent for compost1.9M We streamlined the recycling process for metal scraps from our stamping presses that create metal parts for Model S, Model X and Model 3 by using an online bidding platform to provide local and international recyclers easier access to our scrap metals.",,,
"Decommissioned and scrapped materials, such as charging equipment, motor components, wiring, metal casings, wheel rims and more, are also recycled through this platform.",,,
"This systematic categorization of scrapped materials enables signiﬁcant economic recovery for Tesla from parts otherwise destined for the landﬁll or a scrapyard.MATERIALS RECYCLINGAs a manufacturing company, minimizing waste at Tesla goes beyond recycling o ffice and café consumables.",,,
"Whether via reuse, recycling or compost, e fforts to divert material waste from ending up in a landﬁll or a waste-to-energy facility are found throughout all Tesla manufacturing, service and o ffice facilities.",,,
"In 2016, the Fremont Factory was certiﬁed as a “Zero Waste” facility, and was recognized for our commitment to recycling and product reuse.",,,
"In 2017, the Fremont Factory diverted over 93% of waste from landﬁlls to recycling or to a waste-to-energy facility.",,,
Our on-site recycling center allows the “commoditization” of di fferent recyclable materials.,,,
"CASE STUDY: SPOTLIGHT ON FREMONT FACTORYWhen we ﬁrst opened the Fremont Factory in 2010, Tesla operations were a fraction of the total footprint.",,,
"As areas within the facility expand, we send parts that are no longer needed to an onsite “store” where these items can be used by other Tesla teams.",,,
"For example, surplus eye-wash station signs from the Fremont Factory were made available to a new area opening within our Lathrop facility.",,,
"This reuse e ffort has resulted in millions of dollars in avoided costs, and contributes signiﬁcantly to our efforts to divert as much waste as possible from landﬁlls.",,,
"ON-SITE PRODUCT RE-USE STORE Through e fficiency improvements and water reuse systems, we work to lower the per-product water usage in our manufacturing process.",,,
"In addition, water reduction e fforts are included in our sales, service and delivery facilities.",,,
"Where possible, our service technicians use a waterless car wash method to maintain Tesla vehicles while minimizing environmental impacts.",,,
"Throughout the Fremont Factory, water use per vehicle manufactured dropped by 9% from 2016 to 2017.",,,
"In 2017, we established a water-use baseline for our manufacturing and support operations.",,,
"During the same period, global water use was 8.77 m3 per vehicle.",,,
"As we increase production in coming years, we expect water use per vehicle to decrease signiﬁcantly.",,,
"Our main manufacturing facilities are not only looking to increase water-use e fficiencies, but also to improve wastewater and stormwater management.",,,
These projects include reverse osmosis and distilled water system installations to improve water quality and to allow existing water sources to be recycled and reused in other processing areas such as the closed-loop system of our facilities’ cooling towers.,,,
Projects in development include water mapping to identify opportunities for either recycling or increased passes in our closed-loop systems as well as leak identiﬁcation.,,,
"At Gigafactory 2, Tesla is dedicated to making our production activities supportive of the comprehensive cleanup and transformation of the Bu ffalo River and to ensure the waterway remains a rich environmental, economic and community resource.WATER 25 IMPACT REPORTBATTERY RECYCLING A common question we hear is, “What happens to Tesla vehicle battery packs once they reach their end of life?” An important distinction between fossil fuels and lithium-ion batteries as an energy source is that while fossil fuels are extracted and used once, the materials in a lithium-ion battery are recyclable.",,,
"When petroleum is pumped out of the ground, chemically reﬁned and then burned, it releases harmful emissions into the atmosphere that are not recovered for reuse.",,,
"Battery materials, in contrast, are reﬁned and put into a cell, and will still remain at the end of their life, when they can be recycled to recover its valuable materials for reuse over and over again.",,,
"Since Tesla battery packs are made to last many years, we are only just starting to receive these batteries back from the ﬁeld.",,,
"Currently, most of the batteries for recycling come to us through R&D, manufacturing, quality control and service operations.",,,
"Today, we work with third-party recyclers around the world to process all scrap and end-of-life batteries to recover valuable metals.",,,
Our recycling partners work with us to ensure that non-valuable or non-recoverable materials from the batteries are disposed of responsibly.,,,
"At Gigafactory 1, Tesla is developing a unique battery recycling system that will process both battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries.",,,
"Through this system, the recovery of critical minerals such as lithium and cobalt will be maximized along with the recovery of all metals used in the battery cell, such as copper, aluminum and steel.",,,
All of these materials will be recovered in forms optimized for new battery material production.,,,
"The closed-loop battery recycling process at Gigafactory 1 presents a compelling solution to move energy supply away from the fossil-fuel based practice of take, make and burn, to a more circular model of recycling end-of-life batteries for reuse over and over again.",,,
"From an economic perspective, we expect to recognize signiﬁcant savings over the long term, as the costs associated with large-scale battery material recovery and recycling will be far lower than purchasing and transporting new materials.",,,
"262014 rendering of Gigafactory 1, prior to Tesla beginning construction on the 3.2K-acre site.",,,
Tesla is currently building a solar array on the rooftop to power the factory with sunlight.,,,
"ROOFTOP SOLAR ARRAYTesla ﬁrst broke ground on Gigafactory 1 in 2014, providing the opportunity to build a truly sustainable facility from the ground up.",,,
"Located in Sparks, Nevada, the facility is being built in phases so that Tesla and our partners can manufacture inside the ﬁnished sections as we continue to expand.",,,
This phased approach allows us to learn and continuously improve our construction and operational techniques as we drive down the cost of battery production.,,,
"As with many of our manufacturing processes, Tesla applies ﬁrst-principles thinking to achieve e fficiencies across all areas of Gigafactory 1, translating into lower operating costs.",,,
"Since batteries remain the costliest part of electric vehicles, these e fficiencies are ultimately reﬂected in the cost of the ﬁnal product, allowing us to get more vehicles to consumers.CASE STUDY: GIGAFACTORY 1 — SUSTAINABLE BY DESIGN WATER STORAGE AND RE-USE SYSTEM IMPACT REPORT 27 IMPACT REPORTOne unique aspect of Gigafactory 1 is that there is no natural gas line within the factory.",,,
Tesla made this decision at the design stage because we wanted a sustainably-powered facility with no on-site combustion of fossil fuels.,,,
"While challenging to achieve from a design perspective due to manufacturing processes that require high levels of energy or heat (like high-temperature ovens), Tesla engineered thermal systems to maximize heat recovery resulting in signiﬁcant energy e fficiency gains compared to standard industrial designs.",,,
"This included using heat pumps to upgrade low-temperature waste heat from manufacturing, thus reducing the energy used to heat the facility by over 80% compared to traditional electric heaters and is expected to save over 16K MWh in the winter season.",,,
The facility also has a heat exchanger system to recover more than 60% of the heat from the exhaust of industrial ovens.,,,
"ELIMINATING NATURAL GAS LINES: MAXIMIZING HEAT RECOVERY Tesla designed the Gigafactory 1 roof with a white reﬂective surface and no obstructions, so that it is a perfect ﬁt for solar panels.",,,
"Designed to be a net-zero energy facility upon completion, Gigafactory 1 will be powered primarily by solar from the rooftop solar installation that is currently underway.THE PERFECT SYSTEM: DESIGNING FOR SOLAR 28Several battery manufacturing areas throughout the facility require very low levels of humidity during production (<300 ppmm), and creating dry air for these areas can be costly and require a lot of energy.",,,
"Because Gigafactory 1 is located in the high desert of Nevada, Tesla was able to turn to nature itself and pull in outside air that starts with much less moisture.",,,
Tesla also conﬁgured its compressors and dehumidiﬁer to take the heat rejected by the compressor to supply over 50% of the heat required to be dehumidiﬁed.,,,
"The facility’s unique system dramatically reduces the energy and cost required to produce dry air compared to manufacturing facilities located in more humid regions.BRINGING THE OUTSIDE IN: OUR NATURAL AIR SYSTEMAerial view of Gigafactory 1 in the winter.Traditional cell manufacturing is energy intensive, resulting in large amounts of heat dissipated from manufacturing equipment that must be removed from the building.",,,
This heat removal is achieved by pumping chilled water throughout the entire factory.,,,
"Conventional chilled water generation consumes an enormous amount of electric power and water, even with high-e fficiency chillers.",,,
"To reduce the economic and energy costs of generating this chilled water, Tesla designed and built a one-of-a-kind chilled water plant precisely tuned to take advantage of the vast daily temperature swings and dry desert air by equipping Gigafactory 1 with a 10M gallon concrete thermal energy storage reservoir.",,,
"At night, when the ambient air is cool and dry and the factory operates e fficiently, it intentionally generates more chilled water than is needed for the manufacturing processes and the excess is stored in the reservoir.",,,
"Then, during the daytime when the hot desert sun is beaming and causing the factory to operate at low efficiency, the stored cold water is sent throughout the factory to provide all cooling needs.",,,
"By shifting the generation of chilled water to the night time, the factory is able to operate in “dry mode” so that no water evaporation is required for a greater percentage of time and there is no consumption of water during these periods.",,,
"This improved design is expected to reduce the factory’s chilled water electrical consumption by as much as 40% and water consumption up to 60%, pushing Gigafactory 1 toward its net-zero emissions goals.COLD DESERT NIGHTS: THERMAL WATER STORAGE 29 IMPACT REPORT30To manufacture lithium-ion batteries, a solvent is used to coat metal electrodes inside the cell.",,,
"During manufacturing, this solvent evaporates and is carried away with warm air, leaving behind powders coated evenly on the metal foil.",,,
"The solvent vapor is then condensed out of the air, and the used solvent is collected as a waste liquid.",,,
"In conventional battery factories, this used-solvent liquid is trucked offsite to third-party processing centers.",,,
"To avoid the high ﬁnancial and energy costs of this o ffsite treatment, Tesla designed our own dedicated solvent reﬁning process to convert waste solvent back into reusable solvent in a closed-loop fashion.",,,
"This solvent reﬁning system was constructed onsite and has been operating since the end of 2017, demonstrating a greater than 95% conversion of waste solvent.",,,
This system has also eliminated the need for more than 30 tanker trucks per week that previously would have transported this material to and from an outside reﬁner.,,,
"Due to our onsite reﬁning system that was designed speciﬁcally for this application, the purity of this reﬁned solvent has shown to be even higher than solvent purchased from third-party suppliers.",,,
"The solvent reﬁning process is typically very energy intensive, so Tesla developed a custom heat pumping system to minimize total energy consumption.",,,
Waste heat that is usually sent to a cooling tower is instead captured as recovered heat.,,,
The implementation of this closed- loop steam-water vapor compression heat pump system resulted in an approximately 85% reduction in energy consumption when compared to a standard system.,,,
This heat pump system was the ﬁrst patent application ﬁled for any Gigafactory 1-related operation and was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademarks O ffice in November 2017.ZERO WASTE: SOLVENT RECOVERY SYSTEM03 31 IMPACT REPORT SUPPLY CHAIN3032Tesla is committed to only sourcing responsibly produced materials.,,,
The Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct (Code) and our Human Rights and Conﬂict Minerals Policy outline our expectations of all suppliers and partners who work with us.,,,
"Tesla is committed to making working conditions in our supply chain safe and humane, ensuring that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.",,,
"Tesla suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains.",,,
Our complex supply chain is a unique hybrid of the traditional automotive and high-tech industries and encompasses suppliers from around the world.,,,
Many of our Tier 1 suppliers (i.e.,,,
direct suppliers) do not purchase all of their raw materials directly and instead obtain them from their suppliers and sub-suppliers.,,,
"Therefore, reliably determining the origin is a di fficult task, but the due diligence practices required of our suppliers adds transparency to help us and our suppliers adhere to the responsible sourcing principles of our Code.",,,
Our Tier 1 suppliers are required to register and complete the domestic and international material compliance requirements in the International Material Data System (IMDS) to meet EU and other international material and environmental related regulations.,,,
This requirement is mandated for all suppliers who supply their products or raw materials to us as part of our production-parts approval process.,,,
"Tesla, along with our partners and independent third parties, conducts audits to observe these principles in action.",,,
"If there is a reasonable basis to believe a supplier partner is in violation of the Code, Tesla will transition away from that relationship unless the violation is cured in a satisfactory manner.RESPONSIBLE SOURCING33 IMPACT REPORTWhile Tesla’s responsible sourcing practices apply to all materials and supply chain partners, we recognize the conditions associated with select artisanal mining (ASM) of cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).",,,
"To assure the cobalt in Tesla’s supply chain does not come from ASM sites, we have implemented targeted due diligence procedures for cobalt sourcing.",,,
"We have visited many cobalt mines and processing plants that support Tesla’s main supply chain, as well as potential future suppliers throughout the world.",,,
We discuss with these suppliers the major risks they face and the practices they have implemented to mitigate these risks.,,,
Safeguards include chain of custody controls and iterative checks performed from mining through customer delivery to combat illegal or artisanal ore use; on-site security and access control; hiring practices and management engagement to protect against child labor onsite; internal and third-party audit practices; and engagement with local communities to maintain a positive social license to operate.,,,
It is important to note that there is very little cobalt in Tesla’s battery cells.,,,
"On a relative basis, cobalt is not that signiﬁcant to the composition of Tesla’s battery cells, as we mainly use batteries based on a nickel- cobalt-aluminum oxide (NCA) chemistry, which contain substantially less cobalt than the industry standard batteries based on a nickel- manganese-cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry.",,,
Cells used in Model 3 production are the highest energy density cells used in any electric vehicle.,,,
We have achieved this by signiﬁcantly reducing cobalt content per battery pack while increasing nickel content and still maintaining superior thermal stability.,,,
The cobalt content of NCA cathode chemistry is already lower than next-generation cathodes that will be made by traditional battery cell producers with an NMC ratio of 8:1:1.,,,
"Thus, Tesla not only uses far less cobalt per vehicle than the rest of the electric vehicle industry but also plans to recycle and reuse the cobalt at these batteries’ end of life.",,,
Tesla continues to look for ways to reduce the amount of cobalt used in our battery cells with a goal of eliminating it entirely.COBALT34Tesla has a zero-tolerance policy towards human rights abuses in our supply chain.,,,
"Many Tesla products, like most electronics, contain minerals such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, often referred to as “3TG”.",,,
"While these minerals can be found in deposits all around the world, they also exist in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and surrounding areas.",,,
Tesla’s Human Rights and Conﬂict Minerals Policy is in place to ensure that Tesla's products do not directly or indirectly ﬁnance or beneﬁt armed groups through mining or mineral trading in the DRC and its adjoining countries.,,,
"DOWNLOAD TESLA’S 2017 CONFLICT MINERALS REPORT At Tesla, we strive to have a diverse supply chain and provide the maximum practical opportunities to provide goods and services as a part of the corporate procurement process.",,,

,"In furtherance of this mission, we are excited to publish our second annual Impact Report.",,
,"Transparency and disclosure are important for our customers, employees, and shareholders, which is why we have expanded the Impact Report’s content this year.While many environmental reports focus on emissions generated by the manufacturing phase of products and futuregoals for energy consumption, we highlight the totality of the environmental impact of our products today.",,
,"After all, the vast majority of emissions generated by vehicles today occur in the product-use phase—that is, when consumers are driving their vehicles.",,
,"We believe that providing information on both sides of the manufacturing and consumer-use equation provides a clearer picture of the environmental impact of Tesla products, and we have done so this year largely through a lifecycle analysis detailed in this report.IntroductionTesla aims to continue to increase the proportion of renewable energy usage at our factories in an effort to minimize the carbon footprint for every mile traveled by our products and their components in our supply chain.",,
,"All of the factories that we built from the ground-up, such as Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, and our forthcoming Gigafactories in Berlin and North America, are designed from the beginning to use energy from renewable sources.Making a significant and lasting impact on environmental sustainability is difficult to achieve without securing financial sustainability for the long term.",,
,We generated positive Free Cash Flow (operating cash flow less capex) of more than $1 billion for the first time in 2019.,,
,We believe the notion that a sustainable future is not economically feasible is no longer valid.,,
,4Climate change is reaching alarming levels in large part due to emissions from burning fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation.,,
,"In 2016, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration levels in the atmosphere exceeded the 400 parts per million threshold on a sustained basis -a level that climate scientists believe will have a catastrophic impact on the environment.",,
,"Worse, annual global CO2 emissions continue to increase and have approximately doubled over the past 50 years to over 43 gigatonsin 2019.",,
,The world’s current path is unwise and unsustainable.The world cannot reduce CO2 emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption.,,
,And the world cannot address its energy habits without first directly reducing emissions in the transportation and energy sectors.,,
,"We are focused on creating a complete energy and transportation ecosystem from solar generation and energy storage to all-electric vehicles that produce zero tailpipe emissions.Since the onset of shelter-in-place orders and travel restrictions due to COVID-19, we have seen dramatic increases in air quality across the planet, as well as projections for CO2 emissions to drop in excess of 4% in 2020 compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, according to researchers.",,
,"Because these improvements in air quality and reductions in CO2 are a result of a global economic disruption and not due to systemic changes in how we produce and consume energy, they are not expected to be sustained absent intervention.",,
,"However, these changes have shown us the positive impacts of reduced pollution in a very short period of time.",,
,"At Tesla, we believe that we all have an unprecedented opportunity to learn from thisdisruption and accelerate the deployment of clean energy solutions as part of a recovery for all economies throughout the world, and we will actively continue to advocate for the realization of these long-term changes.According to the Global Carbon project, when fully tallied, total carbon emissions from 2019 are expected to hit another record high of over 43 gigatons for the year.",,

,"Source: World Resources InstituteMission & Tesla Ecosystem5 To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy products that enable homeowners, businesses and utilities to produce and manage renewable energy generation, storage and consumption.",,
,"Homeowners can install solar panels or Solar Roof to power their home using 100% renewable energy and then store that energy in Powerwall, which makes electricity available during peak energy-use periods and at night, while also providing power during grid outages.",,
,"Meanwhile, depending on their particular requirements and the size of the project, utilities and businesses can purchaseMegapack –an infinitely scalable energy storage system that provides greater control, efficiency, and reliability across the electric grid –for their energy storage needs.Renewable energy generation and storage are critical components of developing microgrids—an increasingly important means of delivering reliable and sustainable electricity around the world.",,
,"As the deployment of Tesla’s products continues to accelerate, we can scale the adoption ofrenewable energy, cost-effectively modernize our aging infrastructure (while becoming less reliant on it), and improve the resilience of the electric grid to benefit everyone.Mission & Tesla EcosystemEnvironmental Impact7 In this section of the Impact Report, we will go through the details and calculations of the lifetime environmental impact of our products.We are often asked if electric vehicles (EVs) are more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.",,
,"The environmental impact of zero-emission transport and energy products, like the products that Tesla produces and sells, is undeniably more positive than the GHG-emitting alternatives.",,
,"However, determining the lifetime impact of EVs versus ICE vehicles requires looking at the entire lifecycle -from raw materials to emissions to disposal and not just at the emissions resulting from vehicle usage.",,
,"This is not a straightforward task and some of the most common omissions that we have seen in similar studies include the following: a)Using Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel/energy consumption data (which overestimate fuel-economy and underestimate emissions), rather than real-world data;b)Not taking into account the higher energy efficiency of Tesla’s powertrains;c)Assuming that the average EV needs a battery replacement at some point in its life;d)Not accounting for emissions generated through oil refining and the transportation process; ande)Using outdated data for the carbon impact of cell manufacturing.",,
,We tried to address these considerations and complexities in deriving a more accurate calculation in the following lifecycle analysis.,,
,It is important to remember that environmental impact goes beyond just carbon footprint.,,
,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than four million people die of air pollution every year.",,
,"The reduction of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)and other particulates in the air makes our communities healthier places to live, work, and visit and is another core benefit of driving an EV.In addition, solar panels deployed by Tesla (including SolarCity prior to its 2016 acquisition by Tesla) over the years have generated vastlymore electricity than what was required to run our factories and related facilities.Introduction8 0100200300400500 Model 3 Ridesharing Use(solar charged)Model 3 Personal Use(solar charged)Model 3 Ridesharing Use(grid charged)Model 3 Personal Use(grid charged)Avg.",,

,"The most important variable in a life cycle analysis is real-world fuel consumption or electricity consumption, which impacts the use phase of the lifecycle.",,
,"Various efficiency testing cycles such as the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), WLTP, or EPA don’t truly represent real-world fuel/energy consumption.",,
,"This is why, for the purpose of this analysis, we used average energy consumption over the more than 4 billion miles Tesla Model 3s have travelled to date, including energy losses during the charging process.",,
,"For ICE vehicles, we used real-world fuel consumption data provided by Consumer Reports, according to which mid-size premium sedans for model year 2019 on average achieve 23.6 MPG, and this translates to approximately 420 grams of CO2 per mile, once we account for emissions generated through extraction, refining, and shipment of oil.",,
,"Even if we use the official EPA efficiency rating (instead of real-world data) for a Toyota Prius of 56 MPG, which translates to177 grams of CO2 per mile (incl.",,
,"refining & transport of oil), an EV would still emit fewer lifetime emissions than the Prius.",,
,"Regarding mileage and lifespan, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly less than 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years before it is scrapped.",,
,"Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly.",,
,"On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs has become “greener” over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid.",,
,"Thus, emissions generated through EV charging should continue to decline over time.It is important to highlight that, for the purpose of this analysis, we assumed no additional renewable energy capacity on the grid during the life of the vehicle given the shape of the renewable energy adoption curve in the U.S. is still very much up for debate.",,
,"That said, in the following slide we show that a Tesla Model 3 charged in locations with “greener” grids like New York state,for example, have much lower lifecycle emissions than the U.S. average.",,
,"We believe that cities, states, and countries alike will strive to reduce grid emissions in the future.",,
,This dynamic highlights how EVs on the road today will become cleaner as they age andhow critical “greening” the grid will be to achieving reduced transportation emissions.,,
,"9 Average Lifecycle Emissions in U.S. (gCO2e/mi) While the electricity grid varies from region to region, charging EVs is becoming less carbon intensive every year.",,
,"In the U.S.,coal has historically been the dominant energy source for generating electricity.",,
,"But in the last decade, coal power has declined significantly as regions turn to cleaner energy sources.",,
,"Energy generated byrenewable sources has grown rapidly, accounting foran estimated 43% of new electricity generation capacity in 2018.",,
,"Many U.S. states (such as New York referenced in the chart below) have been making significant investments in renewable energy as these sustainable options become more cost competitive compared to fossil fuel resources.To put this in perspective, average GHG emissions from charging one New York-based Tesla vehicle equates to the emissions from an ICE vehicle with a fuel economy of 144 MPG (no such vehicle is on the market).",,
,"Even when charging aTesla in Michigan, where approximately 64% of energy comes from coal and natural gas, the emissions from our vehicles still equates to the equivalent emissions of an ICE vehicle with 55 real-world MPG (considerably more in terms of EPA rated MPG).",,
,"As more regions adopt sustainable energy solutions to generate power, emissions related to charging an EV from the grid will decrease even further.EV customers can accelerate the process of increasing their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof and an energy storage solution, such as Powerwall, in their homes.",,
,"Such an effort dramatically reduces the lifetime carbon footprintof an EV, even when accounting for the carbon footprint of both the solar panel/Solar roof and Powerwall manufacturing.",,
,"Remaining use-phase emissions from solar charged vehicles come from publicly available fast-charging, which too is becoming “greener” every year.",,

,"Today, our most efficient Model 3 Standard Range Plus (SR+)achieves an EPA range of 4.8 miles / kWh, more than any EV in production.",,
,"Model Y all-wheel drive (AWD) achieves 4.1 EPA miles / kWh, which makes it the most efficient electric SUV produced to date.The energy efficiency of Tesla vehicles will continue to improve further over time as we continue to improve our technology and powertrain efficiency.",,
,"It is also reasonable to assume that our high-mileage products, such as our future Tesla Robotaxis, will be designed for maximum energy efficiency as handling, acceleration, and top speed become less relevant.",,

,"Depends on Powertrain Efficiency *Tesla estimate.Source: OEM websites Average Lifecycle Emissions in U.S. (gCO2e/mi) 11While emissions from the manufacturing phase can account for a relatively minor portion of lifetime vehicle emissions when compared to the use-phase, it is still an important part of lifecycle emissions.",,
,"Thus, we strive to source as much renewable energy where possible for our factories in an effort to reduce our manufacturing-phase emissions.",,
,"As we continue to ramp production of Tesla products, we are committed to making significant progress towards our goal of operating global Tesla manufacturing, vehicle charging, and other operations using 100% renewable energy.",,
,"Predominantly due to lack of reliable data, various third-party studies tend to overstate the actual energy requirement, and therefore the associated emissions, for battery manufacturing.",,
,"In fact, in 2019, the emissions from producing a full EV were nearly comparable to than the emissions from producing an average ICE vehicle.",,
,"That said, battery manufacturing technology continuesto improve rapidly, and we expect the EV manufacturing energy requirement and associated emissions to drop significantly in the near future.In the second half of 2018, Tesla launched an Operations Energy Efficiency Program (OEEP) aimed at reducing energy usage across our factories in Fremont, Nevada, and Buffalo.",,

,"We estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after approximately 200,000 miles of usage in the U.S. and roughly 130,000 miles in Europe.",,
,"Creating a battery that could instead last for a 1,000,000 miles(4,000 to 5,000 charging cycles) would dramatically reduce emissions per vehicle produced.",,
,All vehicles in the world combined travel trillions of miles every year.,,
,"A relatively small number of vehicles, such as taxis, delivery vans, trucks, or buses, account for a disproportionate amount of vehicle miles and as a result, a disproportionate amount of emissions.A single future Tesla vehiclewith a million-mile battery could be utilized over five times more than an average vehicle in the U.S. (almost eight times more than an average vehicle sold in Europe).",,
,"As a portion of the carbon footprint is emitted during the production phase of each vehicle, utilization of such vehicle over 1,000,000 miles dramatically reduces the lifetime carbon footprint per each mile travelled.",,

,"When petroleum is pumped out of the ground, chemically refined, and then burned, it releases harmful emissions into the atmosphere that are not recovered for reuse.",,
,"Battery materials, in contrast, are refined and put into a cell, and will still remain in the cell at the end of their life, when they can be recycled to recover valuable materials for reuse over and over again.Extending the life of a battery pack is a superior option to recycling for both environmental and business reasons.",,
,"For those reasons, before decommissioning a consumer battery pack and sending it for recycling, Tesla does everything it can to extend the useful life of each battery pack.",,
,Any battery that is no longer meeting a customer’s needs can be serviced by Tesla at one of our service centers around the world.,,
,Tesla’s current vehicle batteries are designed to outlast our cars.,,

,"Most batteries that Tesla recycles today are pre-consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control.",,
,"None ofour scrapped lithium-ion batteries go to landfilling, and 100% are recycled.",,
,"The small amount of post-consumer batteries that wereceive are generated from our fleet of vehicles on the road, predominantly from taxi-like vehicles.",,
,"Since we have only been producing Model S for approximately eight years, it will likely be some time before we start receiving back vehicle batteriesinlarger volumes.All materials contained in a battery remain in their original form at end-of-life and the vast majority of these materials are then captured in the recycling process.",,
,"Presently, only high-value elements are recycled and re-introduced into the supply chain.",,
,"However, as recycling technology improves, we strive to re-introduce more and more materials back into their original commodity markets.",,
,"Over half of the materials in a battery cell are metals, which is great for sustainability given they are infinitely recyclable.",,
,"The remaining materials are plastics, organics, and other difficult to re-use materials.",,
,Research is underway by organizations all over the world to improve the ability to recycle these remaining materials.,,
,"Today, we work with third-party recyclers around the world to process all scrap and end-of-life batteries to recover valuable metals.",,
,Our recycling partners work with us to ensure that non-valuable or non-recoverable materials from the batteries are disposed of responsibly.,,
,Tesla is currently developing a unique battery recycling system at Gigafactory Nevada that will process both battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries.,,
,"Through this system, the recovery of critical minerals will be maximized along with the recovery of all metals used in Tesla battery cells, such as copper, aluminum and steel.",,
,"Our ultimate goal is to develop arecycling processes that has high recovery rates, low costs, and a low environmental impact.",,

,"EVs not only reduce the total carbonfootprint, but also help to reduce city pollution.",,
,"Cities around the world are gradually setting targets for banning diesel vehicles, which are known for high NOx and particulate emissions.",,
,We have seen throughout the first half of 2020 that air quality can rapidly improve with the reduction of ICE-relatedtraffic as the restrictions on business and travel due to COVID-19 has led to dramatically fewer miles being driven.,,

,"In 2019,we reduced water usage by 45% to 2.9 cubic meters per vehicle.",,
,"We will continue to look for ways to reduce our water intensity per vehicle produced, and as we increase production and operate more efficiently in coming years, we expect water use per vehicle to continue to decline.Our main manufacturing facilities are not only working to increase water-use efficiencies, but also to improve wastewater and stormwatermanagement.",,
,These projects include reverse osmosis and distilled water system installations to improve water quality and to allow existing water sources to be recycled and reused in other processing areas such as the closed-loop system of our facilities’ cooling towers.,,
,Other projects include water mapping to identify opportunities for either recycling or increased passes in our closed-loop systems as well as leak identification.,,

,"0246 20182019Annual Water Consumption Per Tesla Vehicle Produced (m3)Water usage & power generationWhile many recognize the impact that power generation has on CO2 emissions, its impact on waterconsumption is less appreciated.",,
,"Power generation is one of the leading causes of water withdrawal in the U.S., as water forthermoelectric power is used to generate electricity with steam-driven turbine generatorsand alsoto cool power-producing equipment.",,
,"This means that every kilowatt-hour (kWh) of clean solar energy produced not only lowers CO2 emissions, but alsolowers water consumption.18Emission credit systems around the world are designed to economically benefit companies with non-polluting products.",,
,"In order to meet various emission targets and avoid government fines, polluting companies instead pay non-polluting companies through credit purchases.",,
,"As a result, every manufacturer (OEM) is incentivized to reduce emissions by selling more EVs.",,
,"We have seenstrong positive signs from several OEMs who are launching competitive EVs rather than resorting to manufacturing “compliance cars”, which are usually EVs built on an ICE architecture.",,
,"These vehicles are designed to meet regulatory requirements ratherthan to create the best possible product.In 2019, we generated almost $600 million of revenue selling zero emission regulatory credits to other OEMs.",,
,All of the proceedsfrom such sales will be used for building new factories to produce EVs that will continue to displace ICE vehicles.,,
,"While it is common practice today for ICE vehicle OEMs to purchase regulatory credits from other companies to offset their total CO2 emissions, it is not a sustainable strategy.",,
,"In order to meet increasingly stricter regulatory requirements across the world,OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive EVs.",,
,"In 2019, Tesla delivered over 367,000 EVs globally: That is more than 2x as many as any other automaker in the world and almost 3x as many as the largest non-Chinese automaker –Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance.",,
,"Chinese OEMs have been far more proactive when it comes to EV manufacturing, partially due to generous subsidies that have now decreased, and partially due to local support.",,
,"While many OEMs introduced new EV models in the past two years, their actual global deliveries of EVs increased only marginally.",,

,,"To achieve acutely -needed change, ESG needs to evolve to measure real - world Impact .What ESG measures today: Investment Risk Current environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting does not measure the scope of positive impact on the world.",
,,"Instead, it focuses on measuring the dollar value of risk / return.",
,,"Individual investors – who entrust their money to ESG funds of large investment institutions –are perhaps unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of companies that make climate change worse, not better.",
,,An obvious example of this is measuring the impact of the automotive industry.,
,,"One might think that the more electric vehicles an automaker sells, as a percentage of total volumes, the better its ESG score.",
,,"However, this is not the case.",
,,"As long as a company continues to slightly decrease emissions of its manufacturing operations while churning out gas -guzzlers, its ESG ratings are likely to go up.",
,,"Vehicle use -phase emissions, which represent 80 -90% of total automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all.",
,,It’s easy to see why some oil & gas companies rank higher than T esla on “Environmental Impact.,

,,"On the product front, companies should be required to use real-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it clear when estimates are provided instead of real -world figures.",
,,"An example of this is vehicle “use -phase” emissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle emissions.",
,,Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically and almost never reflect real -world data.,
,,"Automakers often have access to this data, but they don’t disclose it.",
,,"When it comes to a company’s employees, it is essential that they’re treated well, with a system in place to prevent discrimination of any kind, that they have a safe workplace andthat they are rewarded appropriately, with significant upside if their employer does well.",
,,"Many ESG ratings evaluate: “Does this ESG issue impact the profitability of the company?” We need a system that evaluates: “Does the growth of this company have a positive impact on the world?” This evolution of ESG needs to be championed by institutional investors, rating agencies, public companies and the general public.",

,,"Tesla will then explore an expansion to manganese, graphite, copper and mica.",
,,"112Tesla’s Supplier Audit program In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance evaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Tesla’s business.",
,,This program extension was introduced at the time when T esla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production.,
,,"We recognized that this growth came with an increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement.",
,,"During the program pilot phase, we focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts.",
,,We chose to utilize the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the basis for our audits.,
,,The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and stringent requirements for supplier completion.,
,,"It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety, environmental, ethical and management system topics.",
,,"Audits are conducted by independent third parties that are approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its implementation ensuring a globally and industry -wide standardized approach.",
,,"In any case where any priority non- conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures require that suppliers undergo a closure audit.",
,,These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit where the non -conformances were identified –allow suppliers to address all non -conformances in the earlier audits.,
,,"Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies.",
,,"As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once, representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base.",
,,"As part of these audits over 4,000 supplier employee interviews were conducted.Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Program113Continuing to expand our audit program In 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit program.",
,,"While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally.",
,,"When we started our audit program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai.",
,,"We now have six factories across three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially.",
,,"As our global footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base.",
,,"Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base.",
,,"The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk assessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location.",
,,"This criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the potential to further mitigate risk.",
,,"With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50% of our global spend with our direct supply base.",
,,"As part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive way.",
,,"When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans to remedy any deficiencies or non -conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity.",
,,"In cases of the highest priority non -conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that their corrective action plans have been fully implemented.",
,,"In cases of less severe non -conformances, suppliers are still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that those plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines.",
,,"Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero T olerance Violations, which, for example, include any violations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers.",
,,"In cases where such instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be developed immediately, together with the supplier.",
,,Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the supplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable time frame.Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Expansion114 How we identify and prioritize risks in our supply chain Our Supplier Audit program is an important part of our efforts to identify and address environmental and social risks within our supply chain.,
,,"These audits allow for a snapshot of a supplier facility’s programs and procedures, but also sets a baseline for future evaluations.",
,,"Additionally, Tesla utilizes other avenues to evaluate potential risks in our supply chain such as those detailed below.",
,,We engaged with several third -party service providers allowing us to continually monitor our supply chain for emerging issues that may affect our suppliers.,
,,"These include issues related to labor relations, human rights and environmental degradation.",
,,This monitoring allows our Global Supply Managers to be notified as soon as information about suppliers becomes public and act by engaging directly with the supplier to understand their plans for correcting the identified risk.,
,,Tesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct when identifying risks within our supply chain.,
,,We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing practices within our supply chain that are contradictory to our policies.,
,,Our responsible sourcing policies require suppliers to provide requested information regarding potential violations of our policies.,
,,"Furthermore, we continue to leverage our membership with the RBA to identify upcoming supply chain risks as well as understand industry best practices to address them.",
,,We are actively involved with the RMI as well as specific action groups within the organization.,
,,"In addition, we have utilized many of the RBA tools, such as country risk analysis to understand inherent risks in our supply chain and RBA -Online to collect information on corporate and factory -specific supplier performance.Responsible Sourcing Identifying Priorities115Across all audits, we found no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment of workers The table below details findings of our audits across all suppliers regardless of severity and includes initial audits as well as closure audits.",
,,"Through July 2021, our suppliers have addressed and remedied 100% of priority non-conformances, with the remaining open priority findings to be addressed in upcoming closure audits.",
,,Our initial focus on high -risk suppliers allowed us to cover more than 70% of this group in the first three years of the audit program and gave us an understanding of suppliers to prioritize in an expanded program.,
,,"In all audits conducted at Tesla's request at supplier manufacturing facilities producing Tesla products, we found no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment.",
,,"In 2021, the five most common findings were related to ( % of total findings within each category )2: 1.Working Hours ( 20.4% ): no more than 60 hours work per week, overtime is voluntary, one day off per seven days 2.Emergency Preparedness ( 11.1%): proper permitting, emergency risk assessment at 11.1% of total findings; 3.Wages and Benefits ( 9.4% ): proper calculation of regular and overtime wages, timely payment of wages; 4.Occupational Safety ( 7.5%): availability of PPE, proper permitting; and 5.Freely Chosen Employment ( 5.5% ): contract provided in worker’s native language, no excessive penalty for leaving position Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Findings 1 Over the past two years, global pandemic conditions have significantly impacted our suppliers’ ability to schedule on -site audits, leading to a decrease in our annual audit numbers.",

,,,"While not a perfect measure, given the importance of the Model 3 and its high volume of deliveries since 2018, it is a good proxy for understanding the emissions impact of our vehicle business."
,,,The details and boundaries of this LCA analysis are described on page 90.
,,,"Our goal is to eventually produce an LCA for each of our products i n addition to reporting our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions."
,,,EVs undeniably generate less lifetime greenhouse gas emissions than ICE vehiclesWe are often asked if electric vehicles (EVs) are more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.
,,,"The environmental impact of zero- emission transport and energy products, like the products that Tesla produces and sells, is undeniably more positive than the GHG -emitting alternatives."
,,,"This becomes more pronounced when determining the lifetime impact of EVs versus ICE vehicles, which requires looking at the entire lifecycle —from raw materials to use phase emissions to disposal —and not just at vehicle usage emissions."
,,,Variables often overlooked by other lifecycle studies: •Using Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel/energy consumption data (both of which overestimate fuel -economy and underestimate emissions) rather than real -world data; •Not considering the higher energy efficiency of Tesla’s powertrains; •Assuming the average EV needs a battery replacement at some point in its life; •Not considering emissions generated through the oil refining and the transportation process; and •Using outdated data for the carbon impact of cell manufacturing.
,,,"We try to address these considerations and complexities in deriving a more accurate calculation in the following lifecycle analysis.5,340 miles The manufacturing process of a Model 3 currently results in slightly higher GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion engine vehicle."
,,,"However, based on the global weighted average grid mix, a Model 3 has lower lifetime emissions than an equivalent ICE after driving 5,340 miles."
,,,"*For a definition of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions see page 90 of this report."

,,,"Equivalent ICE Vehicles 69 tons Lifetime CO2e emitted by an average internal combustion engine vehicle (model year 2020) sold in the U.S. through its use phase, excluding CO2e emitted during the oil refining phase.Using only real -world data, not official NEDC, WLPT or EPA* consumption data The most important variable in a lifecycle analysis of an automobile is real -world fuel consumption or electricity consumption, as applicable, which impacts the use phase of the lifecycle."
,,,"Various efficiency testing cycles such as NEDC, WLTP or EPA do not truly represent real -world fuel or energy consumption."
,,,"Therefore, for the purpose of this analysis, we used average energy consumption over the more than 10 billion miles Tesla Model 3s have travelled as of December 31, 2020, including energy losse s during the charging process."
,,,"For ICE vehicles, we used real -world fuel consumption data provided by Consumer Reports, which reports model year 2020 mid -size premium sedans achieve 24.8 MPG on average."
,,,"This translates to ~400 grams of CO2per mile once we account for emissions generated through the extraction, refining and shipment of oil."
,,,"The carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year of use, but for EVs, it should improve every yearBased on publicly available sales and fleet data, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly less tha n 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years before it is scrapped."
,,,"Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly."
,,,"On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs has become “greener” over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid."
,,,"Thus, emissions generated through EV charging should continue to decline over time."
,,,"On the following pages, we will show the per mile lifecycle emissions of a current Fremont -made Model 3 This includes emissions from upstream supply chain, direct emissions from manufacturing and electricity consumption, and use phase emissions when charged from a grid with a generation mix that reflects the geographic distribution of Model 3 deliverie s in each of the U.S., Europe and China."
,,,"Below are the lifecycle emissions scenarios we show, and the assumptions used in each of the charts on the following pages: •What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3 were used for ridesharing over one million miles using cell chemistry from Tesla energy products."
,,,•What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3 were principally charged at home using a solar system and energy storage.
,,,•What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3 were used for ridesharing over one million miles using cell chemistry from our energy products and if it were only charged using a solar system and energy storage.
,,,•The reference ICE vehicle is based on the average mid -size premium sedan in the U.S. •Charging a Model 3 using solar panels and a Powerwall adds emissions to the manufacturing phase while reducing use phase emissions to as low as zero when 100% of charging is done using that system.
,,,•We assume no additional renewable energy capacity on the grid during the life of the vehicle given the shape of the renewable energy adoption curve is still very much up for debate.
,,,"* NEDC = New European Driving Cycle; WLPT = Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure; EPA = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency13The electricity grid keeps getting cleaner, while emissions from ICE vehicles do not While the makeup of the electricity grid varies from region to region, charging EVs is becoming less carbon intensive every y ear."
,,,"In the U.S., coal has historically been the dominant energy source for generating electricity."
,,,"However, in the last decade, c oal power has declined significantly as regions turn to cleaner energy sources, such as wind and solar."
,,,"Energy generated byrenewable sources has grown rapidly —in 2021, wind, solar and battery storage are expected to account for an estimated 81% of new electricity generation capacity in the U.S."
,,,"Many U.S. states (such as New York, referenced in the chart below) have been making significant investments in renewable energy, as these sustainable options become more cost competitive compared to fossil fuel resources."
,,,"To put this in perspective, average GHG emissions from charging one New York -based Tesla vehicle equates to the emissions from an ICE vehicle with a fuel economy of 135 MPG (no such vehicle is on the market)."
,,,"Even when charging a Tesla in Michigan, where approximately 60% of energy comes from natural gas and coal, the emissions from our vehicles still equates to the emissions from an ICE vehicle with 59 real -world MPG (considerably more in terms of EPA rated MPG)."
,,,"As more regions adopt sustainable energy solutions to generate power, emissions related to charging an EV from the grid will decrease even further."
,,,"EV customers can increase their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof and an energy storage solution, such as Powerwall, in their homes."
,,,"This dramatically reduces the lifetime carbon footprint of an EV, even when accounting for the carbon footprint of both the solar panel/Solar Roof and Powerwall manufacturing and upstream supply chain.EV vs. ICE Vehicle Emissions per Mile United States 0100200300400500 Model 3 Ridesharing Use (solar charged)Model 3 Personal Use (solar charged)Model 3 Ridesharing Use (grid charged)Model 3 Personal Use (grid charged)Avg."

,,,"Building new, better designed, more efficient vehicle factories Building a factory from the ground up with sustainability in mind can have a material impact on reducing energy use."
,,,"For each component that requires less movement around the factory, and as we use fewer robots in the vehicle production process, energy consumption declines."
,,,"Our Fremont Factory, where we started operation in 2010, was built over 60 years ago by established automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEM)."
,,,"While substantial improvements have been implemented since, it was not possible to fundamentally change the layout of this facility."

,,,"When it comes to subcomponent manufacturing, such as the instrument panel and large stamped portions of the vehicle body, we believe the closer they are manufactured to our factories, the better."
,,,"Localizing suppliers reduces the distance parts need to travel before they are assembled into our vehicles, and reduces the emissions associated with transportation."
,,,Supplier localization also supports the local community and its workforce and reduces the risk of a supply disruption due to geopolitical dynamics.
,,,"While some components (for example, semiconductors) are and will continue to be fabricated at highly specialized manufacturing facilities in specific locations around the globe, heavy vehicle parts will increasingly be produced near our Gigafactories in order to be closer to our vehicle manufacturing process."

,,,"Creating a battery that could instead last for 1,000,000 mile s (4,000 charging cycles) would dramatically reduce the emissions per mile driven for high- mileage vehicles such as taxis, delivery vans or trucks."
,,,"This is clear when comparing the per mile emissions of a Model 3 for personal use versus ridesharing use –the per mile emissions from the use phase remain the same, but the emissions per mile from the manufacturing phase are substantially lower because the emissions are spread over many more miles."
,,,Producing Robotaxis is a core part of our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy All vehicles in the world combined travel trillions of miles every year.
,,,"A relatively small number of vehicles, such as taxis , delivery vans, trucks and buses account for a disproportionate amount of vehicle miles and, as a result, a disproportionate amount of emissions."
,,,"A single future Tesla vehicle with a million -mile battery could be utilized over five -times more than an average vehicle in the U.S. After being fully optimized, and even once it is scrapped, a battery can still be recycled and it s materials used in a brand -new battery.Reducing Carbon Footprint Even Further Increasing Vehicle Utilization Increasing Vehicle Utilization 0%20%40%60%80%100% 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 Distance Traveled (thousands of miles)Tesla Model S/X Battery Capacity Retention per Distance Traveled Standard Deviation Retention23Pollution from burning fossil fuels leads to eight million premature deaths globally each year According to recently published research in Environmental Research by Harvard University, in collaboration with the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London, air pollution causes over eight million premature deaths annually."
,,,That is double the previous estimate of deaths from the negative effects of fine -particle pollution and would account for one -in-five premature deaths worldwide.
,,,This is a major advantage of EVs that is often forgotten about as the overall EV debate tends to focus on greenhouse gases.
,,,"EVs are not just about the future of our planet, but very much about addressing preventable deaths today."
,,,"While air -quality is often categorized as a problem in developing countries, Nitrogen oxide (NOx) and other PM2.5 particulates* cause significant issues in developed countries as well."

,,,"EVs not only reduce the world's total carbon footprint, but also help to reduce city pollution."
,,,"Lockdowns have shown how clean cities could look Cities around the world are gradually setting targets for banning diesel vehicles, which are known for their high NOx and particulate emissions."
,,,We have seen throughout the first half of 2020 that air quality can rapidly improve with the reduction of ICE-related traffic as the restrictions on business and travel due to COVID -19 led to dramatically fewer miles being driven.

,,,"When petroleum is pumped out of the ground, chemically refined and then burned, it releases toxic emissions into the atmosphere that are not recoverable for reuse."
,,,"Battery materials, in contrast, are refined and put into a cell and will remain in the cell at the end of their life when they can be recycled to recover valuable materials for reuse repeatedly."
,,,Longer battery longevity is the most sustainable option Battery pack life extension is the superior option to recycling for both environmental and business reasons.
,,,"This is why before decommissioning and recycling a consumer battery pack, Tesla does everything it can to extend the useful life of each battery pack, including sending out over -the-air software updates to Tesla vehicles to improve battery efficiency when our engineers find new ways to do so."
,,,"In addition, any battery that is no longer meeting a customer’s needs can be serviced at a Tesla service center."
,,,"Every battery used in R&D or returned from the field that cannot be remanufactured are recycled Tesla batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles and our energy storage products, are made to last many years, and therefore, we have only received a limited number of these batteries back from the field."
,,,"Most batteries that Tesla recycles today are pre- consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control."
,,,None of our scrapped lithium -ion batteries go to landfills and 100% are recycled.
,,,"Furthermore, Tesla has an established internal ecosystem to re -manufacture batteries coming from the field to our service centers."
,,,We actively implement circular economy principles and consider all other options before opting for battery recycling.
,,,"The small number of post -consumer batteries that we receive are primarily generated from our fleet of vehicles on the road, predominantly from taxi -like vehicles."
,,,"Since we have only been producing Model S (our oldest model) for approximately nine years, and our energy storage products for even less time, it will likely be some time before we start receiving back vehicle batteries in larger volumes.Battery Materials LifecycleBattery Recycling26 While Tesla works with third -party recyclers, we are also recycling in -house In the fourth quarter of 2020, Tesla successfully installed the first phase of our cell recycling facility at Gigafactory Nev adafor in-house processing of both battery manufacturing scrap and end- of-life batteries."
,,,"While Tesla has worked for years with third - party battery recyclers to ensure our batteries do not end up in a landfill, we understand the importance of also building recycling capacity in -house to supplement these relationships."
,,,"Onsite recycling brings us one step closer to closing the loop on materials generation, allowing for raw material transfer straight to our nickel and cobalt suppliers."
,,,"The facility unlocks th e cycle of innovation for battery recycling at scale, allowing Tesla to rapidly improve current designs through operational learnings and to perform process testing of R&D products."
,,,"Every Tesla battery factory will recycle batteries on site As the manufacturer of our in- house cell program, we are best positioned to recycle our products efficiently to maximize key battery material recovery."
,,,"With the implementation of in -house cell manufacturing at Gigafactory Berlin- Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, we expect substantial increases in manufacturing scrap globally."
,,,We intend to tailor recycling solutions t o each location and thereby re -introduce valuable materials back into our manufacturing process.
,,,"Our goal is to develop a safe recycling process with high recovery rates, low costs and low environmental impact."
,,,"From an economic perspective, we expect to recognize significant savings over the long term as the costs associated with large -scale battery material recovery and recycling will be far lower than purchasing additional raw materials for cell manufacturing.Battery Recycling at Gigafactory Nevada Global annual amount of lithium -ion battery metals sent for recycling by Tesla in 2020: 1,300 Tons of Nickel 400 Tons of Copper 80 Tons of Cobalt A closed -loop battery recycling process presents a compelling solution to move energy supply away from the fossil -fuel based practice of take, make and burn, to a more circular model of recycling end-of-life batteries for reuse over and over again."

,,,"27Waste Generated Per Vehicle ManufacturedAs Tesla builds more efficient factories, our waste per vehicle decreases Building localized factories both makes sense economically and reduces waste."
,,,"Because the automotive supply chain doesn’t have a strong presence on the West Coast of the U.S, many components need to be shipped from long distances, requiring excessive packaging and creating more waste than necessary."
,,,"Second, modern factories are better designed for material flow."
,,,"Trailer entry points surround the whole factory, which means that components can be offloaded precisely at the part of the factory where they are needed."
,,,"Less material flow results in le ss waste, because a shorter journey requires less protective packaging."
,,,The chart below shows that waste generation per vehicle at Gigafactory Shanghai is about half of what it is in the U.S. We are expecting our upcoming factories such as Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas to continue the same trend.
,,,"Any materials that are possible to recycle, we recycle The vast majority of generated waste, such as paper, plastics and metals, is recyclable."
,,,"At Gigafactory Shanghai, for example , just 4% of total waste generated is not recyclable."

,,,The below chart includes our latest estimates for water usage per vehicle at those facilities.
,,,"Water usage and power generationWhile many recognize the impact that power generation has on CO 2emissions, its impact on water consumption is less appreciated."
,,,"Power generation is one of the leading causes of water withdrawal in the U.S., as water for thermoelectric power is used to generate electricity with steam -driven turbine generators andto cool power -producing equipment."
,,,"This means that every kilowatt- hour (kWh) of clean solar energy produced not only lowers CO2emissions, but also lowers water consumption."
,,,*Latest estimate for water consumption based on factory design.
,,,Actual production figures will not be known until factories a re ramped to full production speed.
,,,29Future Tesla factories will set a new standard of water use per vehicle Water is becoming increasingly scarce as the climate changes.
,,,That is why we are reducing our water usage throughout our operations as much as possible.
,,,"We have prioritized direct use in manufacturing and will continue to explore the rest of our impact throughout the supply chain and in sales, service and delivery."
,,,The “cooling tower makeup” is the single biggest contributor to water usage in any car factory after paint operations.
,,,"As wat er that cools machinery evaporates, it needs to be topped up regularly."
,,,The total cooling tower makeup could be offset entirely by non- potable sources such as rainwater or wastewater.
,,,These are some of the initiatives we are taking at Gigafactory Berlin - Brandenburg and/or Gigafactory Texas in order to reduce water consumption per complete vehicle (including cells).
,,,1.Water intensive process optimization We are constantly looking into reducing water consumption by optimizing or eliminating water intensive production processes across our operations.

,,,Rainwater harvesting and reuse We are planning to capture at least 25% of roof runoff (1 million square feet) to a central underground storage system within Gigafactory Texas.
,,,Rainwater will be recycled for use in the cooling of manufacturing equipment.
,,,"In an average year, such systems should save an estimated 7.5 million gallons of potable city water."
,,,3.Reclaimed water (wastewater reuse) Using local treated wastewater could result in offsetting the entire annual cooling tower makeup water demand with non - drinkable uses.
,,,"At Gigafactory Texas, this could result in an estimated 40 million gallons of potable city water conserved annually, which equates to the total cooling tower needs for a vehicle production rate of about 250,000 vehicles a year."
,,,Reclaimed water is available and under investigation for use at both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg.
,,,"4.In-house cathode production As we stated at our 2020 Battery Day, we are developing a more sustainable method to produce cathode in- house."
,,,This new production process will decrease the water needed by current cathode production methods used in the industry by ~95% based on our estimates.
,,,"We are currently validating this new production process at our pilot production line in Fremont, California , and hope to launch it as soon as practicable.Water Used Per Vehicle Manufactured Future State 30Emissions credit systems around the world are designed to economically benefit companies with non- polluting products by allowing them to sell their credits to polluting companies."
,,,"In order to meet various countries’ emission targets and avoid government fines, polluting companies pay non -polluting companies through credit purchases."
,,,The goal of this system is for every OEM to be incentivized to reduce emissions and themselves become non- polluting by selling more of their own manufactured EVs instead of paying another company for their non -polluting credits.
,,,"We have seen strong positive signs from several OEMs who are launching competitive EVs rather than resorting to manufacturing “compliance cars,” which are usually EVs built on an ICE architecture."
,,,These compliance cars are designed to meet regulatory requirements rather than to create the best possible product to help create a more sustainable future for the world.
,,,"Emissions credit revenue is used for EV capacity expansion, which in turn displaces ICEs In 2020, we generated almost $1.6 billion in revenue selling zero- emission regulatory credits to other OEMs."
,,,Proceeds from such sales will go towards building new factories to produce EVs that will continue to displace ICE vehicles.
,,,"While it is common practice today for ICE vehicle OEMs to purchase regulatory credits from other companies (such as Tesla) to offset their totalCO 2emissions, it is not a sustainable strategy."
,,,"In order to meet increasingly strict regulatory requirements across the world, OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive EVs."
,,,"EV sales by all carmakers need to accelerate, taking market share from ICEs In 2020, Tesla delivered almost 500,000 EVs globally."
,,,"While many OEMs introduced new EV models in the past few years, with few exceptions their actual global deliveries of EVs increased only marginally."
,,,"We hope that every car manufacturer will stri ve to produce hundreds of thousands of EVs per year, as significant reduction of emissions will only be achieved if all carmakers pushfor an industry -wide shift to EVs.Emissions Credits Accelerating Deployment of New Factories 0100,000200,000300,000400,000500,000 Tesla Inc.

,,,"We are not just trying to build the best electric cars, we are striving to build the best cars, period."
,,,"Our focus from the beginning has been to develop products that are not only sustainable, but also superior to fossil -fuel alternatives in every way."
,,,"Many incorrectly believe that choosing sustainable products requires consumers to compromise on price or performance, but Tesla vehicles combine performance, safety, efficiency and competitive prices."
,,,"Similarly, Tesla’s energy generation and storage products power both urban and remote communities with reliable, affordable energy.Product Affordability Price Equivalency Between EVs and ICE Vehicles $0$10,000$20,000$30,000$40,000 Mercedes C-class BMW 3-Series Model 3 SR+ Audi A4Starting Price of Mid -Sized Premium Sedans (before subsidies or dealer incentives) Source: OEM websites34Over five years of average driving, the ownership costs of a Tesla Model 3 are roughly the same as a Toyota Camry The accessibility of our products is fundamental to our mission."
,,,"While the “sticker price” of Model 3 is on -par with an equivale nt BMW or Audi, the sticker price of a vehicle itself is only one of many cost items that need to be considered."
,,,"The lifetime runni ng costs of EVs are lower than those of ICE vehicles due to lower maintenance costs and cheap electricity, and the residual valu e of used Tesla vehicles remains exceptionally strong since we first introduced them to the market."
,,,"As a result, Tesla Model 3 has a base price similar to BMW 3- series, but the total cost of ownership per mile is nearly on- par with America’s best -selling sedan, the Toyota Camry*."
,,,Cost data is based on data collected from our fleet The advantage of having a fleet of vehicles that is constantly online is the ability to analyze real -world data rather than only being able to use estimates.
,,,"We have an extensive database of Model 3 residual values and cost of repairs, maintenance, energy use, etc."
,,,"Additionally, the insurance cost for the Model 3 SR+ below is based on the projected median insurance rate in the U.S. for Tesla Model 3 drivers."
,,,"Our analysis shows that over five years and 60,000 miles, running a Model 3 SR+ costs 55 cents per mile."

,,,"We fundamentally believe that you shouldn’t have to choose between price, quality, usability and sustainability."
,,,"An EV should be the best vehicle in every way, so consumers don’t ever need to use ICE vehicles."
,,,"The longer the range, the higher the usage There is a clear relationship between range, how often an EV is utilized and whether it is a primary -use vehicle."
,,,"The more confident owners are that their EV can be used for commuting, errands and long road trips, the less they will feel they need to supplement their EV with an ICE vehicle."
,,,"Surveys consistently indicate that the real or perceived lack of EV range is the key reason why many people do not consider replacing their ICE vehicle with an EV.EVs as the Primary Vehicle Non-Tesla EVs Data tracking annual miles driven during the first three years of ownership in the U.K., collected by the RAC Foundation for non -Tesla vehicles, and data on average annual miles driven by Tesla vehicles collected from our fleet show a clear relationship between an EV’s range and the annual mileage driven."
,,,Tesla vehicles (shown in blue) have by far the longest range and most annual miles driven.36Long -Distance Travel Freedom of travel is the reason people buy vehicles in the first place.
,,,"To ensure we replace as many ICE vehicles with EVs as possible, we have been focused on increasing the range of Tesla vehicles."
,,,"While most personal vehicle journeys are relativelyshort, and thus drivable on a single charge, consumers do not buy cars that can meet most of their driving needs; they buy a car that meets alltheir driving needs."
,,,"The longer the range, the lower the Supercharger use Since its introduction in 2012, we have increased the range of the Model S by over 50%: from 265 miles to 405 miles of range for the long- range variant."
,,,Our focus on energy efficiency —achieving superior range from the same size battery —has allowed to us continue to increase range while keeping the battery size relatively stable.
,,,"Our data shows that the longer the range of our vehicles, the less Supercharging Tesla customers do."
,,,"After all, day trips of over 400 miles are quite rare."
,,,Super -fast charging: V3 Superchargers can increase range by up to 200 miles in just 15 minutes Around 300 miles of range at highway speeds is equal to roughly four hours of driving.
,,,"At that stage, drivers are often likel y to take a break."
,,,We want to make sure that such a break can be relatively short before continuing the journey.
,,,"Our latest generation of Superchargers can recover up to 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes of charging, long enough for a quick brea k and snack."
,,,"Substantial coverage and near -perfect reliability In 2020 alone, we opened 743 new Supercharger locations around the world— an average of two new locations every day."
,,,We want to make sure that every highway in each of our markets is one day covered with Superchargers.
,,,"At the end of 2020, the size of our Supercharging network stood at over 2,500 locations and over 23,000 stalls."
,,,"Perhaps even more importantly, we have been focused on the reliability of our network."

,,,Tesla’s vertical integration and scale provides the company with billions of miles of global real -world data that is gathered as Tesla vehicles are driven.
,,,"This helps us identify edge cases, tr ain our autonomous driving system and test how a feature would perform in the real world without activating it."
,,,Data collection is accurate and conservative compared to industry standards We collect the exact number of miles traveled by each vehicle with Autopilot active or in manual driving mode and do so without identifying specific vehicles to protect privacy.
,,,"When there is a crash, we also receive an alert that is correlated to the exact vehicle state at the time."
,,,"To ensure our statistics are conservative, we count any crash in which Autopilot was deactiv ated within 5 seconds before a crash, and we count all crashes in which the crash alert indicated an airbag or other active restra int deployed."
,,,"In practice, this correlates to nearly any crash at about 12 mph (20 kph) or above, depending on the crash forces generated."
,,,"On the other hand, police -reported crashes from government databases are notoriously under -reported, by some estimates as much as 50%, in large part because most fender benders are not investigated."
,,,"We also do not differentiate based on the type of crash or fault, and in fact, more than 35% of all Autopilot crashes occur when the Tesla vehicle is rear -ended by another vehicle."
,,,"In 2020, a Tesla vehicle with Autopilot engaged in the U.S. experienced just 0.2 accidents per million miles driven while the U.S. average was ~9x higher at 2.0 accidents per million miles driven."
,,,"Even in cases where only active safety features were engaged, our vehicles had a ~4.5x lower collision rate than the U.S. average in 2020.Active Safety 0.00.51.01.52.0 Autopilot Engaged Active Safety Features Only No Active Safety U.S. AvgNumbers of Vehicular Accidents per Million Miles Driven (2020) Our commitment to safety is why all Tesla vehicles built since October 2016 come with a suite of external cameras, additional sensors and onboard computing that enable enhanced advanced safety features like Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Forward and Side Collision Warning, Obstacle -Aware Acceleration, blind spot warnings and more —all of which continue to improve over time through software updates."
,,,"For the latest quarterly accident data related to our vehicles, please view our Vehicle Safety Report .38 Passive Safety Safety starts with our clean sheet design Improving occupant safety has always been key to our mission."
,,,All our vehicles are built off a safety -first architecture with a low center of gravity (thanks to the positioning of our battery) and enhanced frontal impact safety (thanks to the front trunk that is void of the engine found in ICE vehicles).
,,,"Added benefit of enhanced performanceBased on the advanced architecture of Model S and Model X, we engineered Model 3 and Model Y to be the safest cars built to date."
,,,"Even though Model 3 and Model Y have no engine, their performance is similar to a “mid- engine car” due to a centered battery pack and the fact that the rear motor is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather than behind it."
,,,"Not only does this architecture add to the overall agility and handling of the car, but it also improves the capability of stability control by minimizing rotational kinetic energy."
,,,"Model 3 and Model Y score 5 -stars in all NCAP categories After putting Model 3 and Model Y through a series of crash tests used as part of the New Car Assessment Program to calculate the likelihood of serious bodily injury for front, side and rollover crashes, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) awarded each a perfect 5 -star safety rating in every category and subcategory.2020 Tesla Model Y 2020 Subaru Outback39Tesla Safety Awards Rating Agency Model X Model 3 Model Y NHTSA U.S. New Car Assessment ProgramNCAPrating overall and in every category for all 2020 variantsrating overall and in every category for all 2020 variants Best Vehicle Safety Score (VSS) ever achieved according to published NHTSA datarating overall and in every category for all 2020 variants Lowest rollover risk for any SUV ever tested (AWD variant) according to NHTSA testing European New Car Assessment Programme Euro NCAPrating overall and in every category for all 2020 variantsrating overall and in every category for all 2020 variantsNot Rated Australasian New CarAssessment Program ANCAP rating overall and in every category for all 2020 variantsrating overall and in every category for all 2020 variantsNot Rated Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHSNot Rated Received 2020 Top Safety Pick + Award Not RatedIn 2020, Tesla vehicles earned 5 -star ratings from safety rating agencies across the U.S., Europe and Australia."

,,,"At Tesla, we do not believe that safety should be optional.40Fire incidents are ~11x lower for Tesla vehicles than the average vehicle in the U.S."
,,,"When the media reports a story about a vehicle fire, it is usually reporting on an EV fire."
,,,"This is likely a result of the no velty of EV technology, rather than the prevalence of EV -related fires compared to ICE vehicle -related fires."
,,,"The reality is, when compared to Tesla vehicles, ICE vehicles catch fire at a vastly higher rate."
,,,"According to the latest available data, in 2019, there were almost 190,000 vehicle fires in the U.S. alone."
,,,"Due to this public misconception, we decided to start publishing vehicle fire data annually."
,,,"From 2012 to 2020, there has been approximately one Tesla vehicle fire for every 205 million miles traveled."
,,,"By comparison, data from the National Fire Protect ion Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation show that in the U.S. there is one vehicle fire for every 19 million miles traveled."
,,,"In order to provide an apt comparison to NFPA data, Tesla’s data set includes instances of vehicle fires caused by structure fires, arson and other reasons unrelated to the vehicle, which account for some of the Tesla vehicle fires over this time period."
,,,"We continue to improve safety We continue to improve our battery chemistry, cell structure, battery pack structure and vehicle passive safety in order to decrease fire risk to as close to zero as possible."
,,,"As Tesla’s vehicle technology continues to improve, fires will be even le ss likely for our EVs."
,,,"Finally, for the rare instances where Tesla vehicles are involved in a fire, we make detailed information available to first responders so they can safely handle those emergency situations.Fire Safety 01020304050 Tesla U.S. AvgNumber of Vehicle Fires per Billion Miles Driven (2012 -2020) For the latest fire data related to our vehicles, please view our Vehicle Safety Report .41We are also focused on ensuring that our vehicles are the most secure on the road."
,,,"To do that, our team of world- class engineers works day in and day out to ensure that our systems are always as secure as possible."
,,,"And while some of the best security engineers work at Tesla, we believe that in order to design and build inherently secure systems, we cannot work alon e. We work closely with the security research community to benefit from their collective expertise and diversity of thought."
,,,Here is a snapshot of what we do: Continuous product improvementTesla pioneered the concept of vehicles that improve and become more capable over time by ensuring that every Tesla vehicle made since 2012 can accept free over -the-air (OTA) software updates.
,,,"These updates have introduced new features and functionality that have made our vehicles smarter, safer and more enjoyable to drive."
,,,"We have also used the OTA system to ensure that our vehicles are not just as secure as possible when they are delivered, but that they continue to stay as secure as possible throughout their lifetime —meaning that any older Tesla vehicle that keeps its software updated through the OTA system will be just as secure as a newly built Tesla."
,,,"To date, we are the only major automotive company capable of continual software enhancements across its entire vehicle fleet."
,,,"Active engagement Whether through formal events, such as our Bug Bounty program or the Pwn2Own research competition, or less formal channels of communication, we are constantly working with academic researchers and security experts around the world."
,,,We have found that these relationships allow us to benefit from great work being conducted by stakeholders outside of our organization who are just as passionate about digital security as we are.
,,,"For example, when researchers found a vulnerability in the Model S key fob, they reported it to Tesla, allowing us to examine their report and engineer a new in -vehicle update for the key fob, making it even more secure within a matter of seconds following the update."
,,,"The above examples are just a few of the many ways that our industry -leading team of security experts works every day to ensure our vehicles are the most secure on the road today.Cybersecurity 42Resilience of the Grid Grid outages are becoming more common Electrical disturbances in the U.S. are becoming more common, predominantly due to weather and natural disasters."
,,,"According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electrical disturbances cost businesses $150 billion per year."
,,,It is not surprising that homeowners and businesses are increasingly turning to backup power supply options.
,,,Low cost is key to mass adoption We are continuously working on reducing the cost of our products in order to foster mass adoption.
,,,"Ultimately, using renewabl e energy (such as solar or wind) with battery storage will become the cheapest energy option available, regardless of location."

,,,Tesla is a one -stop shop for taking our customers off- grid by covering a large variety of their needs.
,,,"In 2020, Tesla sold 3 GWh worth of energy storage products, roughly 25% of t he 12 GWh global market."
,,,"In order to switch global energy usage to renewable sources, we estimate that global annual battery storage production will need to increase to ~10,000 GWh."
,,,"Residential customers: Solar Roof, solar panels and Powerwall Anyone can dramatically reduce their carbon footprint by installing a Tesla Solar Roof or solar panels with Powerwall."
,,,"In the ory, all U.S. domestic electricity needs, as well as vehicle transportation needs, could be met by sunlight alone."
,,,"Naturally, inst allation of such a system needs to make financial sense for the customer."
,,,"In Massachusetts, for example, we estimate that an average solar and storage system pays for itself with energy cost savings within approximately 12 years."
,,,"As the cost of these product s continues to decline, more customers will be willing to switch to solar and storage purely due to lower overall cost."
,,,Commercial scale customers: Megapack and renewables The beauty of selling commercial storage systems such as Megapack is that purchasing such a product is almost purely a mathematical decision for our commercial customers.
,,,"If installing Megapack makes economic sense, there is no reason not to install one."
,,,"A single Megapack has on average 3,000 kWh worth of battery storage capacity, and given its scalability, enables projects over 1,000,000 kWh."
,,,Tesla Energy continues to be dependent on global cell supply.

,,,"The Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct (“Code”), Human Rights Policy and Responsible Materials Policy outline our expectations for suppliers and partners who work with us."
,,,"Tesla is committed to making working conditions in our supply chain safe and humane, ensuring that workers are treated with respect and dignity and building manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible."
,,,"Tesla suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, a s well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains."
,,,"As our business grows, our strategy evolves according to changing opportunities and risks Our existing Conflict Minerals Steering Committee has broadened its scope to include the Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee in recognition of the diverse sourcing issues Tesla faces as we expand our manufacturing locations globally."
,,,"The committee includes members of senior leadership from supply chain, compliance, environmental health and safety, investor relations, internal audit, legal and policy."
,,,This diverse group of stakeholders allows consensus to be found on addressing existing issues while also discussing emerging areas of risk or concern and finding ways to mitigate negative impacts as soon as possible.
,,,"Risks are prioritized based on several factors: their impact on human rights, significance to the business, Tesl a’s ability to drive change and our relationship with the supply base, among other things."
,,,Tesla has also established dedicated internal supply chain resources to manage responsible sourcing efforts.
,,,Our complex supply chain is a unique hybrid of the traditional automotive and high -tech industries and encompasses suppliers from around the world.
,,,"Many of our Tier 1 suppliers ( i.e., direct suppliers) do not purchase all of their raw materials directly and instead obtain them from their suppliers and sub- suppliers."
,,,"Therefore, reliably determining the origin is a difficult task, but the due diligence practices required of our suppliers adds transparency to help us and our suppliers adhere to the responsible sourcing principles of our Code and guidelines established by the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) and Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)."
,,,"We require our suppliers to follow stringent, internationally accepted standards Our Tier 1 automotive suppliers are required to register and complete the domestic and international material compliance requirements in the International Material Data System (IMDS) to meet EU and other international material and environmental - related regulations."
,,,This requirement is mandated for all suppliers who supply their products or raw materials to us as part of our production -parts approval process.
,,,"Tesla, along with our partners and independent third parties, conducts audits to observe these principles in action."
,,,"If there is a reasonable basis to believe a supplier partner is in violation of the Code, Tesla will transition away from that relationship unless the violation is cured in a satisfactory manner.Supply Chain Introduction Responsible Material Sourcing Lithium Sourcing The vast majority of lithium used in our batteries in 2020 was sourced directly by Tesla."
,,,100% of the lithium we sourced was mined in Australia and Argentina.
,,,We are currently looking at ways to source lithium raw material from the U.S. as well.
,,,46Cobalt Sourcing Human rights issues in the cobalt supply chain require a robust approach to due diligence Tesla’s supply chain due diligence program and efforts to conduct a country -of-origin inquiry with respect to our entire supply chain are in line with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Sourcing from Conflict -Affected and High -Risk Areas (OECD Guidelines).
,,,"In addition to following our due diligence program requirements, all suppliers, sub- suppliers and mining companies within Tesla’s supply chain are required to adhere to our Code, including taking a proactive approach to reducing environmental and resource impacts."
,,,"All our suppliers are also expected to follow our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics , including avoiding any activities related to corruption, conflict of interest or money laundering and any actions that would harm the health and safety of their employees."
,,,"In order to further increase the transparency of our cobalt supply chain, we collect detailed data from relevant suppliers us ing the RMI Cobalt Reporting Template."
,,,"Because Tesla recognizes the history of human rights issues within cobalt supply chains, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), we have established processes to prevent these risks in our suppl y chain."
,,,We also recognize that mining conducted in a responsible and ethical manner is an important part of the economic and social well- being of those communities.
,,,We review all information provided by our suppliers for red flags and risks associated with ethical sourcing.
,,,"Where we can be assured that minerals, including cobalt, are coming from mines that meet our social and environmental standards, we will continue to support sourcing from the DRC and other regions."
,,,"47Cobalt in Our Battery Supply Chain and Our Diversified Cathode StrategyAs Tesla expands our global manufacturing operations, our supply chain will continue to grow and become more complex."
,,,"Regardless of this increased complexity, we continue to maintain high standards for our suppliers’ business practices and respect for human rights."
,,,"Prior to introducing a new battery cell supplier or sub- supplier, we require them to disclose a full mapping of their cobalt supply chain and to provide a recent, verified, independent third- party audit conducted on the refineries within their supply chain over the prior 12 -month period, along with evidence of implementation of any corrective action plan following such audit."
,,,"Third -party audits and ad- hoc Tesla -led inspections of cobalt suppliers and refiners help ensure compliance Once a supplier is approved and integrated into our supply chain, Tesla requires these same suppliers to conduct ongoing annual third- party audits in accordance with the latest edition of OECD Guidelines and the commitments adopted by the RMI in their Cobalt Refiner Supply Chain Due Diligence Standard."
,,,We also conduct ad- hoc Tesla internal inspections of our cobalt refiners to ensure ongoing compliance throughout the annual cycle.
,,,"Following results from conducted audits, we engage with our suppliers to implement audit recommendations as part of a process of continuous improvement of our supply chain."
,,,"To date, we have not identified any instances of any human rights violations in our cobalt supply chain."
,,,"Our nickel -based cathode has less cobalt content than similar chemistries used elsewhere in the industry Tesla’s batteries contain a variety of different cathode chemistries, including nickel -cobalt -aluminum (NCA) and nickel -cobalt - manganese (NCM) for higher energy applications and lithium -iron-phosphate (LFP) for lower energy applications."
,,,Tesla’s batteries that use nickel -based cathode materials contain less cobalt than other similar cathode chemistries used in the industry.
,,,"We continue to work toward batteries that contain lower levels of cobalt, and for some applications it may be eliminated entirely in the future."
,,,"The trend toward higher nickel cathodes is designed to improve vehicle range while lowering overall battery costs, without compromising overall cell performance, such as battery safety and lifetime that is currently enabled by the use of cobalt."
,,,"Tesla will continue to work to advance a diversified cathode strategy for both LFP -and nickel - based cathodes with varying cobalt contents (ranging from zero to low percentage amounts), for both our vehicle and energy products."
,,,"While we work to eliminate cobalt from our cathode long- term, in the short -term it will continue to be an important material It is important to note that we expect our absolute cobalt demand to increase over the coming years because our vehicle and cell production growth rate is forecasted to outpace the overall rate of cobalt reduction on a per -cell basis."
,,,Tesla is committe d to using only responsible sources of cobalt; ensuring transparency and preventing instances of human rights violations associated with cobalt are priorities in our supply chain due diligence.
,,,"48How We Managed Our Battery Cobalt Supply Chain in 2020Any of our suppliers or sub- suppliers sourcing from the DRC must exclusively source from RMAP conformant refiners In 2020, our battery cell sourcing was divided into three distinct supply chains for cobalt: Gigafactory Nevada and Fremont external cell sourcing, Gigafactory Shanghai and Fremont in- house cell production."
,,,"For Gigafactory Shanghai and Fremont in - house cell production, we procure cobalt materials directly from producers that are verified as compliant with Tesla’s Code a nd with whom we have direct contractual obligations around responsible sourcing per OECD Guidelines."
,,,"We work with participants along the value chain to shorten the supply chain by eliminating third- party cobalt refiners and by ensuring that Tesla’s material is stored in clearly marked, segregated areas of the plant and is toll processed on lines dedicated for Tesl a.For Gigafactory Nevada and Fremont external cell sourcing, where Tesla does not directly procure cobalt materials, cobalt is sourced by our battery cell suppliers from many different countries (listed below)."
,,,"For material originating from the DRC, Tesla’s battery cell supplier and sub- suppliers are required to purchase refined cobalt exclusively from qualified, conformant cobalt refiners as per the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) standards set forth by the RMI."
,,,"Audits are conducted by third parties approved by the RMI, and an “Active” or “Conformant” classification provides an acceptable level of supplier transparency."

,,,"64Rewarding the Individual Tesla offers wages and benefits that meet or exceed those of other comparable manufacturing jobs in the regions where we have a presence, and we recently increased our base pay even further."
,,,"In addition, unlike other manufacturers, the majority of employees have the opportunity to receive additional Tesla equity each year based on their performance, which can result in significantly higher compensation beyond our already industry -leading base compensation."
,,,The impact of stock -based compensation can be material for employees Our employees have benefited enormously from value appreciation seen through the years.
,,,"While share prices will remain volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results, stock -based compensation brings shared ownership to the workforce, and our employees are encouraged to make a positive change for the benefit of all."
,,,"Culturally, shared ownership of the company is one of the most essential attributes of working at Tesla."
,,,"For example, assume that an employee received a grant of 320 Tesla shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares quarterly over four years."
,,,"Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the vest of 20 Tesla shares per quarter would equate to $1,331- worth of sellable shares at the end of 2018."
,,,"However, the same vest two years later would equate to $14,113 - worth of sellable shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per share of Tesla stock over that period."

,,,OEM sustainability reportsAnalysis of sustainability reports by auto OEMs shows unrealistic assumptions for both vehicle life and annual mileage.
,,,"For those that disclose their methodology we have found that vehicle life is often estimated to be as low as 10 years and annual distance traveled by vehicles as low as 6,200 miles."
,,,"This compares to an average life of 17 years in the U.S. (20 years in Europe) and 12,000 annual miles in the U.S. (and 7,450 in Europe)."
,,,"When taken together, even before considering the impacts of using real -world MPG instead of NEDC, WLTP or EPA ratings, this leads to a drastic under -reporting of Scope 3 emissions."
,,,"5.0 million metric tons of CO2e savings Tesla estimateTo estimate CO 2e savings, we first measured the amount of miles driven and kWh of electricity generated at the state, province, and country level for 2020."
,,,"We then applied an emissions savings factor (in gCO2e/mi for miles driven and gCO2e/kWh for electricity generated), for each state, province, and country."
,,,"For miles driven, the emissions savings factor is the net of estimated emissions from our vehicles and an ICE with a real -world fuel efficiency rating of 25 mpg."
,,,The emissions savings factor is based on grid emissions intensity in each respective location and includes upstream emissions from the production and transport of fuels.
,,,"We modeled vehicle emissions savings for the U.S., E.U."
,,,"+ EFTA and China, which account for ~90% of miles driven globally."
,,,We then scaled the savings to account for 100% of miles driven by dividing by ~90% and arriving at a global estimate for 2020.

,,,This reference value is based on a currently produced mid- size premium sedan that is comparable to the Model 3.
,,,The accuracy of this estimate for the other ICE vehicles directly depends on how their material compositions compared to that of the reference vehicle as well as on the existing variability of environmental impact profiles across different geographies and suppliers.
,,,"As such, the specific carbon footprint (GWP100/kg) of the reference vehicle is only a proxy for the average premium mid -size ICE vehicle."
