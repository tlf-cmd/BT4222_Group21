,Consumer packaging uses 70% recycled fibers and maintains a recyclability rate above 75%.,,,
,We take every opportunity to reduce packing materials and increase the proportion of recyclable materials used.,,,
,"Whether products are packaged for end-users or prepared for bulk shipping, we design our containers to maximize package density and reduce overall package size.",,,
,"In FY21, we continued the environmental protection initiatives we initiated five years ago, which included development of smaller and lighter-weight packaging and creating a “core box” system so that primary packaging and shipping carton boxes can be shared among product S kUs.",,,
,"With product protection in mind, we use recyclable HDPE-2 in place of polystyrene PS-6 material wherever plastics are required.",,,
,"Our top priorities include removing film lamination, which in most communities renders packaging non-recyclable; switching the brand appearance from black ink to white, which facilitates removal of laminate; and switching tray components from plastics to paper-based materials.",,,

,,,,"Fueled by the massive growth of the gaming market and its insatiable demand for better 3D graphics, we’ve evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtual reality, high performance computing, and artificial intelligence."
,,,,NVIDIA GPU computing has become the essential tool of the da Vincis and Einsteins of our time.
,,,,"For them, we’ve built the equivalent of a time machine."
,,,,"In fact, one of Einstein’s own predictions was recently proven with the help of NVIDIA GPU computing."
,,,,"For the first time in human history, a team of scientists detected and measured gravity waves — a feat Einstein himself doubted possible — opening an important new chapter of scientific advance and earning the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics in the process."
,,,,But the outer edges of scientific discovery are only part of the story of how GPU computing is contributing to human progress.
,,,,"AI, the use of computers to simulate and augment human intelligence, is well on its way to revolutionizing every industry."
,,,,"In healthcare, early detection is the most powerful weapon against disease."
,,,,"We’re contributing directly by bringing AI to medical imaging technologies like MRI, CT, and ultrasound."
,,,,"GE Healthcare has reinvented the CT, doubling image processing speeds by embedding GPU- powered AI in its state-of-the-art Revolution Frontier CT scanner."
,,,,"Going further, we recently introduced the Clara medical imaging supercomputer, which can modernize millions of the world’s aging scanning devices."
,,,,"By connecting these devices to advanced AI capabilities in the cloud, Clara can turn standard 2D scans into fully segmented 3D imagery."
,,,,AI will also modernize the $10 trillion transportation industry.
,,,,Autonomous vehicles promise to make our roads safer and our cities more efficient.
,,,,"They’ll open personal transportation to people previously left behind: the disabled, the elderly, and others for whom driving simply isn’t possible today."
,,,,Automakers and suppliers are using the NVIDIA DRIVE platform to design and train these self-driving cars of tomorrow — to detect objects and plan paths that keep cars and pedestrians out of harm’s way.
,,,,"Our newest addition to the platform, DRIVE Constellation, lets the makers of self-driving cars add billions of training miles to their fleets in the completely safe world of virtual reality."
,,,,"Across the board, our technology is designed for maximum energy efficiency."
,,,,"From the smallest elements of processor design to the largest cloud datacenters in the world, we work relentlessly on innovations that deliver maximum performance per watt of electricity."
,,,,"Our most recent datacenter product, the Volta-based DGX-2, can deliver the same performance of hyperscale CPU server clusters but at 1/18th the power consumption."
,,,,This represents an enormous opportunity to make the world’s computing resources dramatically more efficient.
,,,,These are just a few examples.
,,,,"It’s truly amazing what we can all accomplish as this new, supercharged form of computing delivers a 1,000x leap in performance over the next decade."
,,,,"As we celebrate our 25th anniversary, our ability to tackle the greatest challenges of our time has never been better."
,,,,We will continue to approach our work the NVIDIA way — applying our amazing capabilities to the tough problems that we’re uniquely suited to tackle and that bring us incredible joy.
,,,,"In short, to do our life’s work."
,,,,"Jensen Huang CEO & Co-Founder NVIDIA CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20185 EXECUTIVE LETTERS LETTER FROM OUR EVP, OPERATIONS For 25 years, NVIDIA has enabled pioneering transformations in gaming, computer graphics, and high-performance computing."
,,,,"In recent years, we’ve provided the underlying technologies that make innovations in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving possible."
,,,,"As we continue to develop and enhance revolutionary products that improve lives through technology, we remain steadfast in our commitment to integrate social and environmental responsibility into all aspects of our company."
,,,,"We strive to respect and safeguard human rights in our operations and supply chain, and we conduct our business using sound environmental practices."
,,,,We invest in our local communities and the wider global community.
,,,,"Our stakeholders value these efforts and recognize NVIDIA for purposefully developing energy efficient products, improving resource efficiency, and advancing human rights through our business practices."
,,,,"To inform our sustainability strategy, a committee of about 20 employees works closely with executive staff to identify our annual priority issues."
,,,,It integrates feedback from key external stakeholders.
,,,,And it prioritizes risks and opportunities in cooperation with our executives and board of directors.
,,,,"To execute on our sustainability priorities, including Innovation, Supply Chain and Product Quality, Talent Management Strategy, and Cybersecurity, we have established three primary objectives: 1."
,,,,Operational efficiency and excellence 2.
,,,,Employee recruitment and retention 3.
,,,,"Risk and reputation management Within these objective areas, we: > Design products that maximize performance and minimize energy use > Increase employee diversity and foster inclusion > Minimize risk in our supply chain > Evaluate emerging risks and opportunities related to growing our brand > Respond to increasing calls from stakeholders to provide performance data and transparency around the sustainability issues most important to them > Set goals and monitor our progress toward them We adhere to the Global Reporting Initiative in our reporting processes and continue to align our social impact efforts with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)."
,,,,"In this year’s report, we further aligned our activities with these goals to better highlight our contributions toward the U.N.’s targets."
,,,,"In FY2018, NVIDIA continued to make progress on our priority issues."
,,,,"Highlights include: > Expanding our inclusion efforts by rolling out nontraditional parenting benefits, such as increased adoption coverage, in vitro fertilization, and egg freezing > Implementing a performance-based award system for suppliers that includes their active efforts to improve social and environmental performance > Achieving recognition in significant rankings, such as Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Fortune’s Businessperson of the Year, the Global100, Bloomberg’s Gender Diversity Index, Fortune’s Best Places to Work, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and the CDP > Adding corporate social responsibility to the oversight responsibilities of the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors Our ability to tackle sustainability challenges enables NVIDIA to increase our operational effectiveness, attract and retain top talent, manage our risk, and bring greater long-term value to customers, investors, and other stakeholders."
,,,,"As we reflect on our progress this year, we also look ahead."
,,,,"We’ll continue to push the limits of what’s possible, because it’s embedded in our company’s DNA."
,,,,"In partnership with our customers, employees, suppliers, and investors, we will continue to do our part to create a better, more sustainable future."

,,,,"In FY18, all directors attended at least 75 percent of board and committee meetings on which they served, with the exception of William J. Miller, whose attendance fell below 75% due to illness and who passed away in December 2017."
,,,,"Our corporate governance practices are rated by external organizations, such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)."
,,,,"According to ISS, as of April 2018, NVIDIA’s overall Governance QualityScore was 4, based on the following components: Audit & Risk Oversight 1, Board Structure 6, Compensation 1, Shareholder Rights 7."
,,,,These scores indicate decile rankings relative to a particular index or region determined by ISS.
,,,,A decile score of 1 indicates lower governance risk and a score of 10 indicates higher governance risk.
,,,,Our ISS Environmental & Social QualityScores are both 1.
,,,,"Executive Compensation Our compensation program is designed to pay for performance and to attract, motivate, and retain a high-caliber executive team."
,,,,A significant portion of executive compensation is based on our corporate performance.
,,,,"We administer our compensation program using a rigorous process that includes emphasizing at-risk, performance- based compensation, reevaluating and adjusting our program annually based on stockholder feedback, reviewing peer group practices, and seeking advice from an independent compensation consultant (reporting directly to the Compensation Committee, not to the company)."
,,,,"NVIDIA’s compensation recovery policy states that if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement to correct an accounting error on an interim or annual financial statement included in a report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws, and the board or a committee of independent directors concludes that our CEO or CFO received a variable compensation payment that would not have been payable if the original interim or annual financial statements had reflected the restatement, our CEO or CFO, as applicable, shall disgorge to NVIDIA the net after-tax amount of such overpayment."
