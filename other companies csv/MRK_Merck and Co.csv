"As we pursue our core mission of inventing, developing and delivering medicines and vaccines, we have an ethical duty to support governments in their efforts to protect the right to health by “doing no harm.” We do this in several ways, including: • M onitoring and reporting on the safety of our products • P roviding health care workers and consumers with important information on the benefits and side effects of our products • S afeguarding the health, safety and privacy of patients involved in our clinical trialsIn addition, we are helping to improve access to new medicines and vaccines, address deep-rooted and multifaceted barriers to access, and, through partnerships and public policy, advocate for health care capacity strengthening in ways that are aligned with our business mission and core capabilities.",,,

"While major public health programs in these countries that focus on health priorities such as HIV/ AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and routine immunization are heavily subsidized by the government through international organizations and private funding, health insurance programs often do not exist or are limited.",,,
"As a result, patients in these countries frequently must pay the price of medicines out of pocket, a particularly daunting ask for families living near or below the poverty line.",,,
"Therefore, we develop and support various sustainable strategies to improve access in low- and middle-income countries, including directing differential pricing to patient sub-segments, either directly through national or local programs or indirectly through third-party health care funding sources that demonstrate reasonable and secure product distribution to intended patient segments and subject to applicable legal requirements.27 MSD ESG Progress Report 2019/2020 Introduction General Disclosures Economic Environmental Social IndicesAffordability 2019 Number of countries where dedicated affordability solutions have been initiated* 40 People reached globally through product donation and patient assistance programs and partnerships1 (estimate)*404M Number of patents filed in low-income countries, as defined by The World Bank in its country and lending groups classifications (annual)* 0 * New key performance indicators (KPI) reported in 2019 to support refreshed Access to Health Guiding Principles.",,,

"We have analyzed and reported our Scope 3 impacts using primary operating data, accepted emission factors, and an economic input-output model based on our third-party spend.",,,
"In 2019, our Scope 3 GHG emissions remained roughly the same as in 2018.",,,
Our analysis shows that our Scope 3 GHG emissions impacts are nearly three times greater than our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.,,,
"We are working to reduce those impacts through activities such as reducing waste in our operations, reducing fuel use and looking for opportunities to shift from air shipping to ocean transport when practical.",,,
We are also starting to engage with our strategic suppliers to identify ways to reduce GHG emissions in our supply chain.,,,
These actions not only reduce our environmental impact but benefit the business by reducing costs.,,,

"Air emissions are generated by our manufacturing and research operations, as well as by burning fuel in on-site equipment and fleet vehicles.",,,
Our Air Management Standard requires our facilities to quantify and control air emissions to comply with applicable regulations and emission standards.,,,
Any increase in production can negatively impact our emissions trends.,,,
"Though there are efforts to minimize solvent use in production, solvents are needed for cleaning and disinfecting purposes.",,,
"As the company transforms from manufacturing of pharmaceuticals to biopharmaceuticals, mandatory cleaning and disinfection protocols associated with biologics and vaccines are increasing solvent based emissions.",,,
The Montreal Protocol mandates phase-out of refrigerants that are ozone depleting substances (ODS) per schedules approved for individual countries.,,,
Our facilities ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements that have been established in accordance with each country’s commitments.,,,
"Our company’s Air Center of Excellence (CoE) provides assistance as needed to our facilities to obtain appropriate environmental permits, and to quantify and control air emissions to comply with applicable regulations and emission standards.Production and research emissions Many of our pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, cleaning/disinfection operations and research laboratories require the use of solvents.",,,
Evaporation of solvents into the air is the primary source of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.,,,
"In an effort to reduce VOC emissions, reduction in solvent usage has been incorporated as an element of our Green & Sustainable Science program .",,,
Key elements of the program include designing efficient processes that use fewer and less-hazardous organic solvents and using water-based methods for cleaning our process equipment where they are as effective as solvent-based methods.,,,
"To reduce emissions from processes where organic solvents are used, we use pollution-control technologies such as conservation vents, carbon filters, thermal oxidizers, condensers and scrubbers.",,,
"Fossil fuel combustion emissions Air emissions are also generated by burning fuel in our boilers and power-generation turbines (for heat and energy), and by other combustion processes, such as thermal oxidizers (for treating air emissions) and incinerators (for destroying waste).",,,
Our fleet vehicles and aircraft also burn fuel and generate air emissions.,,,
"These combustion processes result in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",,,
We strive to make our facilities more energy-efficient through our energy-management programs and to improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet vehicles.,,,
"By making these improvements, we also reduce emissions of CO2, NOx, SOx and VOCs from our operations.50 MSD ESG Progress Report 2019/2020 Introduction General Disclosures Economic Environmental Social IndicesAir pollutant emissions by type (MT) 1 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Nitrogen oxides (NOx) 494 455 481 495 384 Sulfur oxides (SOx) 48 37 37 30 27 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 455 440 380 405 418 Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) 0.1 0.7 0.1 0.3 0.6 Note: Previously reported data have been restated per our methodology, which includes adding facilities that have been acquired and removing facilities that have been sold as operating sites.",,,
"1 Data are estimated using conservative assumptions and factors, not measured or weighed.Our NOx emissions significantly decreased from 2018 to 2019 due to the discontinuation of the use of emergency generators at our Puerto Rico facility that were required during an extended power outage caused by Hurricane Maria.",,,
Energy-conservation programs also helped reduce emissions.,,,
VOC emissions increased from 2018 to 2019 due to increases in production and because of continuous data collection improvements with the adoption of more accurate emission-tracking methods.,,,
The decrease in SOx emissions from 2018 to 2019 can be attributed to the use of fuel with a lower sulfur content and our energy-conservation programs.,,,
Emissions of ozone-depleting substances are the result of non-routine releases from temperature-control and fire-suppression systems and can vary from year to year.,,,

"Our waste management standard requires our facilities to comply with applicable generation, management and disposal regulations and standards.",,,
"To minimize our environmental footprint, and align with the U.N.",,,
"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we look for opportunities to avoid the use of hazardous materials, to reuse or recycle materials, and to prevent the generation of waste.",,,
"When prevention, reuse and recycling are not practical, we apply controls and treatment technologies to prevent human health impacts and minimize environmental impacts.",,,
The amount of waste we generate reflects the efficiency of our manufacturing processes.,,,
Our facilities track and report the amount of operational waste they generate and how it is managed.,,,
"We continuously strive to reduce the amount of operational waste we generate and to maximize the use of environmentally beneficial disposal methods such as recycling, composting and waste-to-energy.",,,
Governance Waste management is overseen globally by the Waste and Dangerous Goods Center of Excellence (CoE).,,,
"This CoE reviews waste data to monitor sites’ progress, and provides assistance as needed to support the sites’ work towards these goals.",,,
Each site is responsible for the management of its waste.,,,
"In many cases, we partner with our third-party Integrated Facility Management (IFM) partners to manage site waste and work toward the corporate waste goals.",,,
"For information regarding our environmental management and governance, please see our EHS Management & Compliance page on MSDresponsibility.com.",,,
"Goals Progress Indicator By 2025, no more than 20 percent of our global operational waste will be sent to landfills and incinerators (without energy recovery).26% to landfills and incinerators (without energy recovery)On Track By 2025, we will maintain global water use at or below 2015 levels.",,,
46% of sites On Track Waste minimization begins with the upfront evaluation of our product designs and manufacturing processes.,,,
"Through our Green and Sustainable Science program , we design processes that use safer chemicals, consume less energy, use less water and other resources and generate less waste.",,,
"Our process development biologists, chemists and engineers have the expertise to create more sustainable ways to make our products.",,,
"To ensure our waste is managed in an environmentally responsible manner, we use only approved waste disposal facilities.",,,
"Approved facilities demonstrate that they have the systems, technologies and practices to manage our waste streams responsibly and in compliance with all applicable requirements.",,,
We routinely audit these facilities to verify the acceptability of their systems and practices.,,,
Waste types are defined differently in various parts of the world.,,,
"For this report, we have divided our operational waste into two categories: Hazardous waste: Heavily regulated or high-risk waste streams that need to be neutralized, treated or destroyed to address a particular hazard such as toxicity, flammability, corrosivity, radioactivity, pharmaceutically active or infectious.Non-hazardous waste: This includes all other operational waste.",,,
The amount of construction project related waste can vary significantly from year to year based on the number and size of projects.,,,
"Therefore, our definition of operational waste does not include construction or demolition waste from projects.",,,
"Over the past year, a number of countries in Asia have passed legislation restricting the acceptance of solid waste from other countries.",,,
"Historically, a large percentage of recyclable waste collected in the United States has been shipped to Asia for recycling, so this change had and continues to have the potential to affect the percentage of our non-hazardous waste sent for recycling.",,,
"However, this change did not negatively impact our recycling rates in the past year.",,,
"The percentage of our non-hazardous waste sent for recycling increased from 38 percent to 40 percent from 2018 to 2019.52 MSD ESG Progress Report 2019/2020 Introduction General Disclosures Economic Environmental Social IndicesGRI 306-2 Waste by type and disposal method SASB 250a.4 Amount of product accepted for takeback, reuse, or disposal Global operational waste 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Incinerated (without energy recovery) 13% 20% 19% 24% 19% Landfilled 15% 10% 10% 9% 7% Total 28% 30% 29% 33% 26% Hazardous waste (MT) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Incinerated (without energy recovery) 7,928 13,186 13,462 17,639 14,035 Energy recovery 11,089 9,871 9,538 10,300 13,655 Recycled 5,944 6,135 7,979 6,827 8,034 Other 2,299 2,425 2,423 2,221 1,865 Reused 1,428 2,132 1,505 695 1,147 Landfilled 1,652 1,492 745 731 938 Composted 5 5 0 0 0 Total 30,345 35,246 35,652 38,413 39,67453 MSD ESG Progress Report 2019/2020 Introduction General Disclosures Economic Environmental Social IndicesNon-hazardous waste (MT) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Recycled 15,811 14,636 15,188 12,975 14,188 Energy recovery 9,706 10,342 8,576 9,273 10,030 Composted 3,018 3,771 4,668 4,798 4,843 Landfilled 8,459 5,826 6,633 5,684 4,603 Other 304 445 212 209 1,025 Reused 970 972 1,071 2,204 660 Incinerated (without energy recovery) 1,243 1,361 426 374 477 Total 39,511 37,353 36,774 35,517 35,826 Hazardous and non-hazardous waste (MT) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Recycled, energy recovery, reused or composted 47,971 47,864 48,525 47,072 52,557 Landfilled and incinerated (without energy recovery) 19,282 21,865 21,265 24,428 20,053 Incinerated (without energy recovery) 9,171 14,547 13,887 18,013 14,512 Landfilled 10,111 7,318 7,378 6,415 5,541 Other 2,603 2,870 2,635 2,430 2,890 Total 69,856 72,599 72,426 73,930 75,500In 2019, we managed approximately 75,500 metric tons of waste from our operations, a two percent increase from 2018.",,,

,,,"We have also developed and implemented novel tools and approaches intended to build relationships and reach potential study participants within their own communities, including partnership with local pharmacies and mobile study sites."
,,,"Integrating health equity across our business Our approach to health equity is key to our ESG and Global Diversity & Inclusion (GD&I) commitments, and is reflected in how business units across the enterprise and value chain are integrating health equity goals and capabilities in their business strategies and performance objectives."
,,,"These efforts are guided by an enterprise Health Equity Strategic Framework that lays out clear goals, a roadmap and implementation plan that guides how we integrate health equity across our core business functions and practices.CONTINUED: GRI 203 | SASB 240a.1 | SASB 240a.2 | SASB 240b .2 | SASB 240b .3 In addition to measuring impact through our health equity target of reaching 30 million people in LMICs and U.S. underserved populations, progress on internal efforts is tracked using a key performance indicator dashboard that is reported into an internal Health Equity Steering Committee comprised of senior leaders."
,,,"The KPI dashboard enables alignment, accountability, and transparency and acceleration of efforts across the organization."
,,,"Investments in capabilities building We are making a commitment to our people, investing in our talent to strengthen their capabilities and evolve our ways of working."
,,,"In 2022, we launched a $1 million Health Equity Catalyst Fund to empower teams at the local and regional levels to create solutions that promote more equitable health outcomes and care experiences, particularly for populations who are underserved, by engaging at the community level to remove barriers to care and/or strengthening health systems to deliver on high quality and accountable care."
,,,"We are investing in strengthening internal data capabilities to ensure we can utilize and apply social determinants of health data to support the design and rollout of effective solutions and partnerships, as well as track key metrics that help us to better understand the impact of our actions/investments."
,,,"We are ensuring that our employees have the latest knowledge and data through the development of training resources, guidelines, tools and a new health equity learning network."
,,,"Vaccines Key accomplishments and milestones The total number of our vaccine doses that have been distributed has increased significantly since 2013, and our global reach has also increased dramatically."
,,,"In 2021, approximately 76 percent of our vaccines were distributed outside the U.S., up from 34 percent in 2013."
,,,"More than 73 million doses of two of our vaccines—GARDASIL® [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and RotaTeq® (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent)—have been distributed in Gavi-eligible countries through 2021."
,,,This represents important progress toward ensuring that these vaccines reach people in low-income settings who are at high risk for certain vaccine-preventable illnesses.
,,,"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 63 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices By December 2019, ERVEBO® (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) had been approved by the U.S. FDA and conditionally approved by the European Medicines Agency, received WHO prequalification and been approved in two African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi."
,,,"As of April 2022, the vaccine has also been approved in nine African countries, the United Kingdom and Switzerland."
,,,"In January 2021, our Company confirmed an agreement with UNICEF to establish the world’s first global Ebola vaccine stockpile with ERVEBO, which represents a new and important tool in supporting future outbreak preparedness and response efforts."
,,,The stockpile inventory is being built over time and will be maintained by our Company.
,,,"Since establishing the agreement to build the stockpile, we have been working with UNICEF to deliver licensed doses."
,,,"As of August 2022, the currently available doses of licensed vaccine in the stockpile is over 400,000."
,,,"The global stockpile, governed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision, will offer a critical, rapid- response tool to help combat future outbreaks of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus."
,,,"Access pricing We work with governments, international health and development organizations, donor groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and others to support countries’ population health aims and help improve sustainable vaccination programs."
,,,"Our commitment to helping protect global health by improving the affordability, availability, accessibility and use of our vaccines around the world is fundamental to our business and overall purpose."
,,,"We offer GARDASIL, which is indicated to help reduce the risk of certain HPV-related diseases later in life, at an access price that is significantly less than the value-based price in other countries."
,,,"The access price for vaccines is exclusive to the public sectors of the countries eligible for support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance."
,,,"In 2015, we extended our current Gavi prices for GARDASIL through 2025 to Gavi-graduated countries with a per-capita gross national income (GNI) not exceeding $3,200, as well as Gavi-accelerated transition or fully self-financing countries that meet Gavi’s Exceptional Opportunity criteria."
,,,"This greatly assists countries that have transitioned out of Gavi support by facilitating access to these vaccines in those countries, while also ensuring that they remain affordable and sustainable in the long term."
,,,"In the short period of time since we made our price commitment to countries transitioning out of Gavi support, numerous countries have taken advantage of the offer to introduce or continue existing national HPV vaccination programs."
,,,We also remain actively engaged with Gavi on policy efforts to improve access to vaccines in Gavi-transitioned countries.
,,,"We believe that our pricing approach contributes to broader access to our vaccines while taking into account our need to continue investing in vaccine research, development and production."
,,,"Manufacturing and supply In the last few years, countries around the world have enacted new or expanded vaccination programs."
,,,This has contributed to an unprecedented increase in global demand for vaccines.
,,,We are committed to increasing our capacity and supply capability.
,,,"Our commitment across the Company to invest in capital projects over five years has increased to $20 billion, with a portion dedicated to vaccines."
,,,"We continue to invest in manufacturing and end-to-end supply improvements in both capability and capacity to help ensure a sustainable, reliable supply of quality and affordable vaccines to serve global needs."
,,,"Our manufacturing division continuously works to improve manufacturing processes and reduce operating costs by increasing efficiency, minimizing procurement spending and improving supply performance."
,,,Maintaining product quality is paramount.
,,,"To provide high-quality vaccines to people who need them, we manage our supply chain through policies and procedures designed to keep the distribution system secure."
,,,That is why we continue to explore potential strategic partnerships with other manufacturers to increase supply and promote greater access in local markets.
,,,"COVID-19 manufacturing agreements In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we entered multiple agreements to support efforts to expand the manufacturing capacity and supply of COVID-19 medicines and vaccines."

,,,Registration and prequalification We seek to ensure global access to our vaccines by obtaining and maintaining up-to-date product registrations around the globe.
,,,"In order to make our products available to the people who need them throughout the world, we registered 141 products and devices in 2021."
,,,"The majority of these products were registered in LMICs in the Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Americas regions."
,,,"In addition to having our medicines and vaccines approved by stringent regulatory authorities, when relevant to enhancing access in LMICs we also work to have certain medicines and vaccines prequalified through the WHO prequalification process so that our products may be easily obtained and distributed to underserved populations."
,,,The table below summarizes the registration and WHO prequalification status of a select list of our vaccines.CONTINUED: GRI 203 | SASB 240a.1 | SASB 240a.2 | SASB 240b .2 | SASB 240b .3 WHO prequalification can facilitate product procurement by international procurement agencies.
,,,"WHO’s prequalification program covers medicines for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, neglected tropical diseases, influenza, reproductive health and diarrhea, in addition to vaccines."
,,,"In the absence of reliable national medicine authorities that can certify that health care products meet required quality, safety and efficacy standards, stringent regulatory authority and WHO prequalification can serve as a basis for quality assurance for procurement by international agencies and national programs in lower- income countries."
,,,We have made efforts to address the unique needs of low-income countries where the infrastructure and personnel to deliver immunization services can be severely limited.
,,,"Specifically, we focused on product improvements that included features such as vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) and use in controlled-temperature-chain conditions."
,,,"In May 2022, we obtained WHO Prequalification for GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 vaccines compatibility for use outside the cold chain for up to four days."

,,,Our process is as follows: 1.
,,,The World Resource Institute’s (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool is used as an initial step to map water risk.
,,,"Sites are categorized annually using the “Baseline Water Stress” indicator, which is the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to total annual renewable supply and accounts for upstream consumptive use."
,,,Higher stress values indicate more competition among water users.
,,,2.
,,,Sites that are identified as high risk are further assessed utilizing a catchment-specific approach to confirm that the catchments are experiencing high water stress.
,,,3.
,,,"Sites that are known to experience water risk, regardless of the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool assessment, are included as high- risk sites."
,,,4.
,,,"Water conservation plans are put in place at high-risk sites that use more than 100,000 m3 of water per year."
,,,"We work with a third party, water-use expert to evaluate opportunities for water-use reductions at these sites, resulting in site-specific water conservation plans."
,,,5.
,,,Sites that do not meet the water-use threshold will continue to be monitored for operational risk and conservation plans will be put in place as needed.
,,,Performing this assessment ensures that we can adapt our strategy to changing stressors in each catchment.
,,,It enables us to better prioritize facilities and catchments for water stewardship activities and lays the foundation for potential future water targets in priority locations.
,,,"In 2021, the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool identified two of our manufacturing and/or research facilities as being in areas with “extremely high” Baseline Water Stress and eight as being in areas with “high” Baseline Water Stress."
,,,"In 2021, there were three fewer sites in areas of “extremely high” risk than in 2020 due to changes to our site network."
,,,"As a result of the above methodology, we have two sites that have water conservation plans in place."
,,,"GRI 303-2 Water discharge-related impacts We conduct environmental risk assessments on our products (small molecules, biologics and vaccines) from the development phase through product launch, to understand and manage product impacts both from manufacturing and patient use."
,,,"We assess products in a manner consistent with the most stringent applicable global regulations, including the regulatory review processes of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency."
,,,"Product environmental safety profiles are reassessed during periodic renewals of product filings, and risk-mitigation actions are implemented when needed."
,,,"We use the information from our risk assessments to establish or update our internal, compound-specific Environmental Quality Criteria (EQCs), which are used to confirm that wastewaters discharged from our facilities do not contain levels of residual products that present a risk to human health or the environment."
,,,"Our manufacturing facilities are required to use these EQCs, along with industry-accepted risk- assessment methods, to establish procedures for managing and controlling active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in their wastewater."
,,,"Each facility uses the internal EQC standards to: • Assess the potential risk from its operations using science-based and industry-accepted risk assessment methods • Minimize environmental impacts from wastewater discharges in the local watershed • Establish procedures for managing, treating or controlling APIs in wastewater prior to discharge where needed Our production facilities have, or will be provided with, API-treatment technology such as advanced oxidation where needed, so that our wastewater discharges meet both regulatory requirements and these internal standards.The sites that use the most water in our network are located in the U.S. Of these, two are in areas of “high” Baseline Water Stress according to the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool but, through the assessment process described above, are considered medium risk."

,,,This is predicted to rise dramatically as climate change continues and population grows.
,,,"Without biodiversity, ecosystem services are not as productive, which, along with other things, exacerbates the rate of climate change."
,,,"To slow climate change, we need to slow biodiversity loss by aligning our demands with nature's ability to produce and safely absorb our waste."
,,,Loss of biodiversity will reduce our ability to discover and develop medicines.
,,,Plants and bacteria are well-recognized sources of new medicines.

,,,Operational waste is primarily generated from the following activities: • Manufacturing • Packaging • On-site wastewater treatment • Research Waste minimization begins with the upfront evaluation of our product designs and manufacturing processes.
,,,"Through our Green and Sustainable Science program (see GRI 301 on page 83), we design processes that use safer chemicals, consume less energy, use less water and other resources, and generate less waste."
,,,"Our process development biologists, chemists and engineers have the expertise to create more sustainable ways to make our products."

,,,"To ensure our waste is managed in an environmentally responsible manner, we use only approved waste disposal facilities."
,,,"Approved facilities demonstrate that they have the systems, technologies and practices to manage our waste streams responsibly and in compliance with all applicable requirements."
,,,We routinely audit these facilities to verify the acceptability of their systems and practices.
,,,Waste types are defined differently in various parts of the world.
,,,"For this report, we have divided our operational waste into two categories: • Hazardous waste: Highly regulated or high-risk waste streams that need to be neutralized, treated or destroyed to address a particular hazard such as toxicity, flammability, corrosivity, radioactivity, pharmaceutically active or infectious • Non-hazardous waste: This includes all other operational waste The amount of construction project-related waste can vary significantly from year to year based on the number and size of projects."
,,,"Therefore, our definition of operational waste does not include construction or demolition waste from construction projects."
,,,"Over the past few years, a number of countries in Asia have enacted legislation restricting the acceptance of solid waste from other countries."
,,,"Historically, a large percentage of recyclable waste collected in the U.S. has been shipped to Asia for recycling, so this change had and continues to have the potential to affect the percentage of our non-hazardous waste sent for recycling."
,,,"However, this change had minimal impact on our recycling rates in the past year."
,,,The percentage of our non-hazardous waste sent for recycling increased from 39 percent to 42 percent from 2020 to 2021.

,,,Pay equity is a topic that is rightly receiving a great deal of attention and scrutiny.
,,,"While many other organizations have only recently begun to explore how to pay their employees equitably, providing fair and equitable pay has been one of the pillars of our compensation philosophy."
,,,"Our efforts toward pay equity include: • Regularly monitoring and evaluating our pay practices and policies to ensure that we are paying our employees equitably across all genders, races and ethnicities • Basing compensation for new hires on their skills, work experience and other job-related factorsCONTINUED: GRI 405 Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 149 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices • Training our managers on our diversity, equity and inclusion policies to ensure that decisions regarding employees, including those related to compensation, are based on legitimate job-related criteria and not personal characteristics such as gender, race or ethnicity We have also engaged external experts and legal partners to conduct annual pay equity studies in the U.S. and abroad."
,,,"As of 2021, we have conducted such analyses including approximately 75 percent of our global employee population."
,,,These studies allow us to identify whether any adjustments to compensation would be sensible in order to ensure that we continue to pay our employees equitably and fairly.
,,,"By the end of 2022, we expect our pay equity studies will achieve nearly global workforce coverage."
,,,"Our 2021 pay equity study for the U.S. showed that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for female and male employees, as well as for non-white (including Black, Hispanic and Asian employees) and white employees, in each case, in equivalent positions."
,,,"Where appropriate, based on the determinations of our pay equity studies, we make base salary adjustments to support our progress toward sustained pay equity across gender, race and ethnicity."

,,,"The goal of the coalition is to achieve full gender parity by 2030, with a near-term goal of women holding at least 30 percent of senior roles."
,,,"Building upon this commitment, GD&I partnered with Paradigm for Parity in 2021 to launch the Profit and Loss Leadership Accelerator Program for Multicultural Women."
,,,"The program recognizes that operational oversight of a company's profit and loss, commonly referred to as P&L, is a key benchmark for C-suite potential."
,,,"However, just 31 percent of women say they have P&L experience compared to 71 percent of men according to research by Seramount."
,,,"Of this 31 percent of women who have P&L experience, 74 percent are white and just 26 percent are women of color."

,,,These surveys are just one of the avenues we use to directly engage employees and remain accountable to their needs.
,,,It also allows us to be responsive to employee feedback on workforce issues and integrate their input into decision-making.
,,,"We are proud of the fact that in the most recent survey, which occurred during the pandemic (and, in the case of the U.S., during a period of increased voluntary resignation known as the “Great Resignation”), 80 percent of our employees stated that they felt a sense of belonging at our Company."
,,,"Related to our focus on inclusion is our commitment to a decade- long practice of understanding, measuring and acting to sustain high employee engagement."
,,,"Like many companies, and following the social unrest and injustice witnessed in the U.S. and around the world, the practice of listening deeply to our employees was critical to our own decision-making and influenced leaders across the organization."
,,,Many of our EBRGs were highly engaged in offering listening forums to colleagues to foster authentic and courageous conversations in an emotionally safe environment.

,,,"Recognition programs for people of color in science The Merck Research Award for Underrepresented Chemists of Color recognizes graduate students and post-doctoral fellows for their chemical science research across a range of focuses, such as computational, analytical, medicinal, biological and synthetic chemistry."
,,,"David Thaisrivongs, who is a director in chemistry based in Rahway, started this initiative when, after the social unrest in 2020, he noticed that there were not many chemists of color at our Company."
,,,We developed a three-month program that attracted over 130 applicants and awarded 12 recipients.
,,,The applicants must be third-year graduate students at a minimum or postdocs doing research in chemistry at a U.S.-based institution.
,,,Awardees were paired with a Merck mentor and networked with another winner.

,,,"We have put into place the processes necessary for compliance with the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the European Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, including those related to clinical trial registration and posting results."
,,,"For those who analyze, report or publish the results of clinical trials, a clinical trial registry also provides information on trials in progress and the ability to track such trials over the course of development."
,,,"Company-sponsored and -conducted clinical trials involving patients assigned treatment with investigational and marketed products are registered at trial initiation on www.clinicaltrials.gov, www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu and www.encepp.eu."
,,,"In accordance with our public policy position statement, all investigational studies in human subjects are conducted in a manner consistent with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines for the protection of human subjects, including those issued by the International Council for Harmonisation: Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP)."
,,,"However, individual country regulations and guidelines should remain the primary determinant of specific requirements for the conduct of medical research."
,,,"We have a commitment, where appropriate, to the study of diverse patient populations, including underrepresented groups, women and children, in our clinical trials in all regions of the world."
,,,"As a result, we strive to obtain information among diverse populations, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the safety and efficacy of our medicines and vaccines."
,,,These efforts allow us to seek regulatory approvals throughout the world and thereby offer our medicines globally to patients who need them.

,,,"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 174 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices This community of practice was established to assist in identifying and organizing health literacy advocates with the goal of training and educating colleagues more broadly, both through formalized, concerted efforts and through incidental collaboration in the course of daily work."
,,,"In the fourth quarter of 2021, the community of practice launched an internal health literacy dictionary with more than 1,000 words, and established an internal health literacy portal for the exchange of materials and best practices."
,,,We are dedicated to increasing people's health literacy in the U.S. and around the world.
,,,"As part of this commitment, our health literacy team has developed a novel method to enhance the patient labeling process for new compounds."
,,,"The purpose of this is to validate comprehension across all the different consumer categories, with a particular emphasis on those who have lower levels of health literacy."
,,,"To date, 10 of our medicines have FDA-authorized patient labels that were produced with input from patients whose health literacy skills ranged from low to high."
,,,Employees who create and assess patient labeling for novel compounds are required to undergo training in health literacy methods for patient labels beginning in 2021.

,,,"We have developed and continue to improve upon a comprehensive, global, state of the art information security and cyber resiliency program to enable us to fulfill our purpose: inventing for life."
,,,There is increased pressure for companies to adopt the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as the basis for their own privacy policies and programs.
,,,We are well positioned in that we have based our global program on the GDPR.
,,,"In addition, our privacy program is flexible and adaptable to be compliant to new laws and regulations that take effect in the jurisdictions where we conduct business."
,,,"Examples include the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in California, the Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) in Virginia, the Privacy Act (ColPA) in Colorado, and major revisions to the Data Protection Acts in China, Ecuador, Japan and Saudi Arabia."
,,,"In addition, there is increased regulatory scrutiny and interest in companies that seek to collect and monetize personal information without full transparency and permission from data subjects."
,,,Regulators will continue to increase requirements in these areas and levy fines.
