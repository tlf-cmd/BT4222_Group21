"Building Resilient Health Systems in Europe COVID-19 disrupted healthcare systems around the world, making it difficult and, in some cases, even impossible for many people to access diagnostic services ."
"Delayed diagnosis can have life-threatening impacts on people living with cancer who, if not diagnosed promptly, may be unable to benefit from treatment ."

"(Lara Cooper/Direct Relief)Healthy People 18 | ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT 2021 Introduction COVID-19 Response Healthy Society Healthy Planet A Healthy Amgen Appendix ACCESS TO MEDICINES To help address this challenge, in 2021, Amgen sponsored two reports on the collateral impact of COVID-19 on cancer diagnosis in Europe ."
"The reports included policy recommendations to help nations reduce wait times for cancer care caused by COVID-related delays, build more resilient healthcare systems, and better weather future crises ."
"In partnership with the European Cancer Organization, the UKs National Screening Committee, the European Cancer Patient Coalition, and other groups, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science hosted webinars to share findings from the reports with more than 1,000 attendees in over 70 countries ."
"There is a positive message from the pandemicif there is a will, there is a way ."
"All the stakeholders have the possibility to act together and do something for better diagnosis and screening, said Alfonso Alguaron, a patient advocate in Spain, during the Cancer Wont Wait webinar ."

One challenge many patients face is difficulty finding a headache specialist due to specialist shortages .
"In addition, many patients find it difficult to see a specialist due to work and caregiving responsibilities ."
"This challenge was compounded by COVID-19, which made face-to-face consultation even more difficult ."
"Partnering with MICIN, Amgen launched a pilot program to assess the usefulness of telemedicine for patients in Japan living with migraines ."

It might as well have arrived empty .
"The humid, subtropical climate had already taken its toll ."
Dr .
"Trish Scanlan said the medicine, which must be kept at a temperature between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, had arrived from Dar Es Salam in the loose, insecure package ."
"Over the hours on its journey, the medicine had warmed ."
It was useless .
"An absolute disaster, Scanlan said ."
It meant the cancer was getting a break in a child who needs that medicine now .
"For Scanlan, director of the nonprofit childrens cancer charity Tumaini La Maisha, seeing medicine being wasted was too much ."
"In 2021, she found help through a California-based nonprofit, Direct Relief, and Amgen ."
"Both stepped in, supporting Muhimbili National Hospital and Tumaini La Maisha with a cold room that cost nearly $20,000 that keeps medicines at the low temperatures needed ."
"Direct Relief is also supplying Tumaini La Maisha with 50 thermal packages that can be reused for up to five years, while Amgen is donating $12 .5 million10 worth of oncology supportive care medicine ."
High-Tech Packages The thermal packages began arriving in Tanzania in April .
"Mike Wooten, Direct Relief cold chain specialist, said the boxes that will carry the cancer treatments are a mix of high-end data technology and old-school durability that shouldnt pose any problems for shipping medicine overnight in Tanzania ."
"Each package, about 8 liters, has a battery-operated data logger to keep track of the temperatures as the box is transported, to make sure the medications inside never go above the ideal temperatures ."
He said the packages are good for about 80 hours in worst-case weather .
"Meanwhile, the cold storage unit will enable bulk purchases for medications without fears of spoiling ."
"The Work Scanlan said about 4,000 children in Tanzania will develop cancer each year, but less than a quarter of those currently seek care ."
She said the arrival of the cold chain supplies will allow more children to get life-saving treatment and spend less time in the hospitals .
"We can send boxes of chemo every week and look after the children in the peripheral areas, Scanlan said ."
That means the children have to spend far less time of their life in the hospital and can be at home with their family between treatments .
"As a cancer survivor herself, Scanlan knows the pain and struggle of the fight ."
She said she wont be satisfied until the thousands of children suffering with cancer in Tanzania all have access to treatment .
Thats the work .
And the mission .

At our 8th Annual Health Equity Summit we focused on disrupting health disparities through partnership .
"The virtual event included more than 500 participants from seven countries representing patient advocacy organizations, physician associations, medical institutions, academia, and the private sector ."
Discussions from the summit yielded five key takeaways .
"HEAL TH EQUITYWorking to Increase Diversity and Improve Representation in Clinical Trials The underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority patients in clinical trials contributes to the collection of incomplete or limited trial data, limited access to innovative treatment for vulnerable populations, and disparities in health outcomes ."
"Barriers to participation include mistrust, lack of awareness, logistical challenges such as transportation, and provider bias ."
Racial and ethnic minority groups have been underrepresented in clinical trials vs .
the proportion of the general population that they represent .
"Black Americans bear a disproportionate share of the cancer burden, having the highest death rate and the lowest survival rate of any racial or ethnic group in the U ."
S .
for most cancers .
Yet according to the U .
S .
"Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in 2019 alone, of the participants in oncology trials, 73% were White, 18% were Asian, 4% were Black American and 5% were Hispanic ."
"Black Americans are 30% more likely to die from heart disease than non-Hispanic Whites, but they make up only 2 .5% of cardiovascular disease clinical trials ."
Black and Hispanic Americans patients suffer disproportionately from severe asthma .
"However, they are often underrepresented within clinical trials of asthma therapies ."
"Amgen is working to improve the proportional representation of trial participants in clinical trials by addressing key systemic issues that deter people from participating in research, Healthy People 22 | ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT 2021 Introduction COVID-19 Response Healthy Society Healthy Planet A Healthy Amgen Appendix HEAL TH EQUITY especially those groups who have been historically excluded due to race, ethnicity, sex, age, and other factors ."
"Amgens Representation in Clinical Research team, also known as RISE, is working to address these barriers ."
"In 2021, RISE led engagement with representatives of historically underserved and excluded communities through a series of product- agnostic community advisory boards ."
"This helped us obtain insights and perspectives on best practices for engagement with these communities more broadly, with the goal of building long-term, sustainable relationships ."
We will continue to seek guidance from key community advisors to help ensure that our efforts resonate with community needs and highlight community members voices .
"In 2021, we developed, with input from RISE, an enterprise-wide framework to strengthen our focus on enhancing diversity and representation in clinical trial participation across our portfolio ."
"In addition, we have developed diversity plans for multiple clinical studies that align with industry principles and FDA guidance for industry to enhance diversity in clinical trials and encourage inclusivity in medical product development ."
"In early 2022, Amgen announced its support for the CEO Roundtable on Cancer s new multiyear initiative Going for Gold ."
"This initiative will work with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions to improve health equity, education, navigation, and access ."
"The program is expected to positively impact more than 20 million lives, especially among communities disproportionately affected by cancer ."
"Through the initiative, universities can contribute to research efforts through the CEO Roundtables Project Data Sphere, which helps expand access to clinical trial research and offers an open-access digital platform for aggregating and analyzing data to advance health equity efforts ."
"Increasing Access to Oncology Trials for Underrepresented Communities Recent data from the FDA show that, of total participants in clinical trials for oncology products that led to approvals, just 4% were Black participants and 5% were Hispanic participants, despite the fact that, during this same period, 13 .4% of the U ."

"population was Black and 18 .1% was Hispanic .11 This is even though Black, Indigenous, and People of Color overall in the United States have both the highest death rates and shortest survival rates for most cancers .12 Amgen is investing in programs to increase scientific data with the goal of changing these numbers ."
"One way to contribute to this change is by bringing historically underrepresented patients into clinical trials conducted where they live, such as in community clinics where four THREE-YEAR PLAN / SIX PILLARSRISE is working to exceed industry standards for clinical trial diversity and representation and to help Amgen develop new medicines studied in participants who better reflect the populations impacted by certain diseases or conditions ."

12 Improving Diversity and Inclusion in Cancer Clinical Trials and Research .
"Evolve the way we design and run clinical trials, focusing on people who have been historically excluded from clinical researchPartner with clinical trial investigators who are representative of the participants they are aiming to recruitBring the research directly to the communities where people live and workChange how researchers communicate with patients, caregivers, and providersEnhance precision medicine awareness and improve genetic diversity in translational scienceCollaborate with national and community organizationsHealthy People 23 | ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT 2021 Introduction COVID-19 Response Healthy Society Healthy Planet A Healthy Amgen Appendix HEAL TH EQUITY fifths of cancer patients in the United States are treated ."
To reach these patientsmany of whom are from lower-income backgroundswe established the Amgen Community Oncology Research Collaborators program .
This initiative makes it easier for community oncologists at more than 200 sites across the United States to refer their patients to studies of Amgens investigational cancer medicines .
"Since its inception in 2018, we have offered oncologists at sites participating in the program more than 65 new clinical trial opportunities for their patients, representing a 2,100% increase ."
We are also supporting a study led by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and the University of Florida to develop and assess the effectiveness of a novel online training program designed to increase primary care providers understanding of cancer clinical trials and their capacity to encourage patients to inquire about clinical trials when making treatment decisions .
The study will include 400 providers who predominantly treat patients underrepresented in clinical trials .
Study results are expected by early 2023 .
"Through support from Amgen, our longtime partner the Lazarex Cancer Foundation recently launched several innovative community-based Cancer Wellness HUBs in partnership with the University of Southern Californias Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center ."
These HUBs bring existing cancer education and awareness efforts directly to residents of underrepresented and vulnerable communities .
"This partnership is designed to provide residents of underserved communities with access to the latest available research, information about current clinical trials, technology, access to available lifestyle improvement programs, and opportunities to optimize health outcomes ."
"They also offer a safe space for residents to talk about health concerns, including disease prevention, survivorship, and end-of-life issues ."
One of the key goals of the HUBs is to connect patients to clinical trials .
"The Lazarex Cancer Foundation is helping raise awareness of the benefits of clinical trials for many here in Los Angeles, said Freddie Muse Jr ., a prostate cancer survivor and founder of The Mens Cancer Network in Los Angeles ."
"This is especially important for people of color, many of whom have concerns and misconceptions about trials based on historical incidents ."
"The Mens Cancer Network is working with Lazarex, to not only change mindsets, but to help our community navigate access to trials ."
"Lazarex is helping our network get reimbursed for the costs associated with travel to and from clinical trials, lodging, and mealsseemingly small, but potentially significant, barriers to access for many ."
Addressing Health Equity Through Comprehensive Health Education Historically underrepresented populations have lower rates of screening and diagnosis for many life-threatening conditionsfrom cancer and heart disease to osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis .
"Delays in diagnosis in some cases mean patients do not receive access to potentially life-saving treatments until it is too late, leading to higher mortality rates for underrepresented and underserved populations ."
One group at risk is Black women who have undergone treatment for breast cancer and may be at an increased risk for osteoporosis and bone fracture .
"For the second year in a row, Amgen partnered with the Tigerlily Foundation to raise awareness among young women, women of color, and underserved communities regarding bone health and its impact specifically on breast cancer patients ."
"Through education and multimedia efforts, the campaign reached more than six million people ."
"We are also working with TOUCH, the Black Breast Cancer Alliance, to help the Black breast cancer community advocate for the best healthcare possible ."
"Amgen is supporting Touchs The Doctor is In: Bone Health Campaign, that includes a weekly web series, and a #LoveYourBones social media campaign to connect women to educational blogs, resources, and events featuring testimonials and tips for maintaining healthy bones ."
"Working to Raise Health Awareness Through Trusted Community Leaders Religious leaders are among the most trusted members of local communities, providing vital information on social services, education, and health to their congregations ."
"We work with the Health Education Advocacy Learning (HEAL) collaborative, which partners with faith-based organizations to help make communities of color healthier ."
"Amgen is supporting a number of HEAL initiatives in Georgia, Ohio, Texas, and Maryland to raise awareness of diseases that disproportionately affect undeserved communities and people of color, including osteoporosis, Healthy People 24 | ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT 2021 Introduction COVID-19 Response Healthy Society Healthy Planet A Healthy Amgen Appendix lung cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma ."
"The program includes information on risk factors, channels for accessing care, and seeks to raise awareness about participating in clinical trials for potential treatments ."
"Our work with Amgen has put a spotlight on diseases that most people, including those from underrepresented communities, have cursory or no knowledge at all about symptoms, let alone available screenings or clinical trials, said Howard Mosby, who serves as one of the leaders of HEAL ."
"Amgen has proved through its work with us that it is not interested in checking off boxes, but wants to see the needle move as a result of education and policy change ."
Addressing Social Determinants of Health Recent data13 show that disparities in cardiovascular risk factors between Black and White adults in the United States may be largely attributable to social determinants of health .
"To improve our understanding of this issue, Amgen partnered with Humana to conduct a study among patients who have been hospitalized for cardiovascular-related conditions ."
"Social determinants of health can have a greater impact on health outcomes than clinical factors, especially within underserved populations ."
"Barriers most often reported by respondents included food insecurity, financial strain, housing quality, and transportation barriers ."
"In terms of the groups most likely to face social determinants of health barriers, 68% of White survey respondents reported no social needs, while more than half (54%) of Black survey respondents reported at least one social need ."
"Amgen and Humana will use the findings to identify, implement, and evaluate potential interventions ."

"In addition, as the effects of climate change could be disruptive to business, we are doing our part to decrease carbon emissions, water use, and waste disposed and working to reduce the risks of climate-related events to our operations and to make Amgen a better partner for the communities in which we live and work ."
"Drought, wildfires, heat, flooding, and pollution are already creating serious threats to lung health ."
"According to recent research by public health experts in the United Kingdom, short-term exposure to elevated levels of air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels can exacerbate asthma, affect lung function, and increase respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions and deaths ."
"Research also shows that, far too often, people of color and people living in low-income communities live and work in places in areas with increased risks from climate change and are more likely to have chronic lung disease .25 As a Company focused on improving health and saving lives, Amgen is determined to be part of the solution ."
"In September 2021, we sponsored a virtual Expert Voices roundtable (hosted by a leading national news outlet Axios) to hear how stakeholders from across disciplines are addressing challenges, and to better understand how Amgen can collaborate to make an impact ."
"Leaders, subject matter experts, and policy makers from various geographies and disciplines gathered virtually to discuss the widening socioeconomic disparities and preventative measures ."
They also shared ideas on how to better prepare for future and long-term effects of climate change on lung health .
"To read more about the conversation, visit Axios' event recap here ."
Amgen is also seeking to support lung health through a new collaboration with the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) .
"The collaboration aims to help reduce disparities in asthma prevalence, healthcare utilization and mortality among underserved, high-risk populations through the Health Equity Advancement and Leadership program (HEAL) ."
"AAFA will work in 2022 with community-based partners to increase patient knowledge, strengthen patient and physician communications, and help address asthma symptoms ."

"EXPLORING CLIMATE CHANGE AND LUNG HEAL THENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Healthy Planet 47 | ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT 2021 Introduction COVID-19 Response Healthy People Healthy Society A Healthy Amgen Appendix CARBON NEUTRALITY Manufacturing Through innovative manufacturing technologies implemented at our manufacturing facility in Singapore , we reduced carbon emissions by 69% and water use by 54%, as compared to conventional biotechnology manufacturing .26 In January 2022, we received FDA approval for a new manufacturing facility in Rhode Island utilizing the same technologies as our facility in Singapore ."
"In addition, in 2021, we announced plans for the construction of new facilities in Ohio and North Carolina ."
"At both, we are embedding environmental sustainability into upfront project design, development, and execution ."
"For example, at our new multiproduct drug substance manufacturing facility in North Carolina, we expect our carbon footprint and water usage to be substantially lower than at a traditional drug substance manufacturing plant due to deployment of innovative technologies and resource conservation ."
The site will use traditional drug substance technologies and Amgens latest innovations to create a facility called FleXBatch .
"This new FleXBatch plant exemplifies Amgens approach to innovative and sustainable biomanufacturing, which Im pleased to announce we are now calling Amgen EcovationTM, said Bob Bradway, Amgen CEO ."
"This new name underscores what is today and has always been distinctive about biomanufacturing at Amgen: It is highly innovative, efficient, safe, and environmentally sustainable all in the service of benefiting patients with medicines manufactured according to the highest quality standards ."
"In Ohio, we are building our new final product advanced assembly and packaging plant to LEED27 standards to maximize energy efficiency and waste reduction ."
"Electric Vehicles By 2027, we plan to convert 30% of our sales fleet vehicles to electric vehicles (EV) .28 In 2021, we launched an EV pilot program in the United States, the Netherlands and South Korea, enabling sales representatives and medical liaisons to upgrade their traditional fuel-operated vehicle to a new electric vehicle ."
Our program also includes EV charging infrastructure improvements in the EV marketplace .
"Renewable Energy The generation and procurement of clean, renewable energy is an important component of achieving our 2027 carbon neutrality target .29 Across our network, each Amgen facility has a portfolio of renewable energy projects ."
"Projects range from installing innovative renewable energy technologies, such as onsite solar arrays, to purchasing electricity from renewable sources ."
"In 2021, we increased the number of facilities sourcing renewable energy, including our major North American sites in Rhode Island and our headquarters in California; our aim is for all Amgen facilities, wherever feasible, to procure 100% renewable electricity by 2027 ."
Our carbon neutrality target applies to Amgen-owned and -operated facilities and operations .
"At the end of 2021, renewable electricity accounted for 79% of our total electricity consumption, compared to 41% in 2020 ."
We achieved this increase in renewable electricity through the purchase of renewable energy certificates for electricity consumption at our North American facilities .
WATER We plan to achieve our water reduction target30 of 40% by emphasizing water treatment and recycling as well as reduced primary usage .
"While our strategy is global, we work with different Amgen sites particularly in water-stressed regions ."
Amgen completed externally validated water studies at each of our major manufacturing sites in 2021 to identify additional reduction opportunities .
We also established a cross-functional water sustainability team to share projects and best practices globally .
"By the end of 2021, Amgen had identified more than 90 potential water reduction projects ."
"These are being reviewed for viability and prioritization, including some key projects involving large utility systems such as reverse osmosis skids and cooling towers ."
"In 2021, Amgen developed water reduction pipeline proposals with the potential for high impact at facilities in water-stressed regions ."

"30 Reductions take into account only verified reduction projections, do not take into account changes associated with the contraction or expansion of the Company and are measured against a 2019 baseline ."
"ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Healthy Planet 48 | ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT 2021 Introduction COVID-19 Response Healthy People Healthy Society A Healthy Amgen Appendix SUSTAINABILITY BY DESIGN We are growing with the future in mind by integrating sustainability into our expansion efforts ."
"In 2021, we upgraded our LEED design and construction standards from Sliver to Gold certification for all new buildings and major renovations ."
"This includes the design, construction, and operation of our planned new facilities in Ohio and North Carolina ."
LEED is the most widely used green building rating system in the world .
"We also initiated an internal carbon fee as part of our investment lifecycle management (ILM) process, which includes capital projects and building leases ."
"Beginning in 2021, this process now requires project-specific sustainability plans and assigns an internal price to carbon emissions, water intake, and waste generation ."
"For example, projects that increase carbon emissions above an established threshold are charged an internal carbon fee to help ensure that the impact to the environment is accounted for in our decision-making as we consider alternative options with lower environmental footprints ."
WASTE We plan to reduce 75% of waste disposed31 through recycling and reuse of waste materials sent to landfills or disposed via combustion or incineration without energy recovery .
"In 2021, three Amgen sites did not send any waste to landfills ."
"While our strategy prioritizes innovation and efficiency to reduce waste before its generated, for 2021 Amgen Rhode Island transferred the majority of the landfill waste it did generate to a neighboring state for energy recovery ."
"The change was made, in part, because the Rhode Island Central Landfill, which provides disposal for 97% of Rhode Island residents, is projected to reach its capacity in the next decade ."
Waste-to-energy incineration is a better alternative to landfills for waste disposal and actually reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere .
"JIM RAWLEY , Environmental Healthy & Safety Manager at Amgen Rhode Island Mask Recycling A Silver Lining of the COVID Cloud The emergence of COVID-19 in 2020 brought with it the need for our employees to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks, and in some cases gloves at Amgen facilities ."
"However, while helping protect the safety of employees and contractors at our sites, we also wanted to mitigate unnecessary waste ."
"Beginning in July 2020, we partnered with a global leader in recycling hard-to-recycle materials to help ."
"Through our partnership, our employees can dispose of used PPE in onsite collection boxes ."
"Our third-party vendor then breaks down the used PPE into its component fibers and plastics, which can be used to create new products such as plastic lumber for park benches ."
"Through 2021 we recycledand diverted from landfillsapproximately one metric ton of masks at our corporate headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California ."
"31 Reductions take into account only verified reduction projections, do not take into account changes associated with the contraction or expansion of the Company and are measured against a 2019 baseline ."
"ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Healthy Planet 49 | ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT 2021 Introduction COVID-19 Response Healthy People Healthy Society A Healthy Amgen Appendix ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY While the program is currently only in the United States, we are exploring expansion to other Amgen sites in Europe ."
"University of Massachusetts Lowell was one SAM recipient in 2021, receiving donated pipettes and other lab equipment for use in its Cell and Tissue Engineering teaching labs ."
"Of this amount, 123 metric tons has been donated to educational programs and nonprofit organizations ."
"Since the program began in 2012, we diverted approximately 1,950 metric tons of materials from the landfill through SAM ."
"In 2021, we diverted approximately 82 metric tons of materials from landfills through SAM ."
"For assets not able to be repurposed, SAM responsibly recycled approximately 17 metric tons of material ."
SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING Amgen is on a journey to reduce the environmental impacts of its packaging through its Global Packaging Sustainability program .
"In 2021, we enhanced our Green Packaging Assessment process, showing its impact on our carbon footprint ."
"Moving forward, we plan to conduct life-cycle assessments on existing packaging to inform new, more sustainable designs for Amgen products that reduce adverse impacts on the variety of life in the world, or biodiversity ."
"We also started to phase out use of PVC in secondary packaging, an accomplishment our manufacturing sites in Ireland and the Netherlands were the first to achieve in 2021 ."
"Moreover, in addition to efforts to promote biodiversity, we remain committed to using fully recyclable paperboard from certified sustainable forests in the packaging of all Amgen products and, where regulation allows, to shift to electronic leaflets ."
"In 2021, the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation honored Amgen with its Healthcare and Scientific Award ."
"The award showcases Australian industrys commitment to meeting the nations 2025 packaging targets and building a regenerative, or circular, economy approach to packaging ."
"Among its efforts, Amgen is participating in the reusable Cool Green Shipper collaboration with the logistics company DHL and also examining recyclable and renewable alternatives to PVC in packaging trays for several products packaged in Australia ."
"FINDING NEW HOMES FOR SURPLUS ASSETS To conserve financial resources and reduce environmental impact, Amgen maintains a robust Surplus Asset Management (SAM) program, where staff can repurpose or donate equipment for reuse ."
"This includes items such as laboratory, manufacturing, and facilities equipment; office furniture and supplies; and carts, glassware, and spare parts ."
"SAM also auctions equipment and donates to nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, and programs like the Amgen Biotech Experience (see page 39), an innovative science education program that empowers teachers to bring biotechnology into their classrooms ."

"I was excited to join the pilot program because I know electric vehicles are the future, said Meeks."
"Along with the sustainability benefits, theyre fun to drive!"
"Globally, Amgens field fleet represents around 15% of the Companys overall carbon footprint, making it the third largest contributor of carbon emissions, behind Amgens manufacturing facilities in Juncos, Puerto Rico, and Thousand Oaks, Calif ."
"The goal of the pilot program is to capture lessons learned in preparation for launching a minimum of 1,800 electric vehicles on the road globally by 2027 ."
"It will take global participation to help Amgen reach carbon neutrality32 by 2027, said Yanina Barrera, Ph ."
"D ., Principal Engineer, Engineering Technical Authority, who leads Amgens sustainability efforts to increase electrification33 of the field fleet to at least 30%, and electrifying our fleet in countries that are ready is critical to making that happen ."
"The pilot has not been without challenges, ranging from the lower mileage range of electric vehicles paired with limited charging infrastructure availability in some territories, and the lack of available vehicles due to supply chain issues ."
"Nevertheless, as of January 1, 2022, Barreras team has placed orders for 195 electric vehicles, which have been assigned to field staff ."
"Planning is also underway for deployment of all-electric vehicles in other geographies, and we have launched the program in the Netherlands and South Korea ."
"To support the transition, Amgen is providing home charger installation and hosting driver workshops to educate on issues such as public charging stations and reimbursement processes for electricity usage ."
"For Meeks, its an experience he has been glad to be part of ."
"I look forward to driving the car -- Its fun, its high tech, and it puts a smile on my face every time ."

"Since 2010, Amgen has reported to the CDP and you can find our most recent CDP reports for Climate Change and Water here ."
"Our reports provide additional details about Amgens governance, strategy, risk management, metrics, and targets related to climate change and water ."
"Over time, CDPs disclosure platform for climate change has evolved to contain over 25 questions (within its governance, risks and opportunities, strategy, targets and emissions modules) that are aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD; this platform is now nearly in full alignment with the TCFD ."
"We continue to report to the CDP as completely as possible and, in 2022, we are undertaking a TCFD-aligned scenario analysis assessment to improve our understanding of the physical and transitional effects of climate change as well as to inform our future reporting ."
"Additionally, while the Companys 2027 environmental sustainability targets do not incorporate Scope 3 emissions, we continue exploring approaches to better understand this area, including identifying potential emissions reduction opportunities in our value chain .2021 PERFORMANCE DATA We measure and report on our overall carbon emissions, energy, water use, and waste disposed ."
"We include data gathered from 16 manufacturing, R&D, and distribution facilities located in North America, South America, Asia, and Europe, representing (based on square footage) approximately 88% of our operations ."
"For the remaining 12% of square footage, primarily administrative offices, we estimate energy usage to calculate carbon emissions ."
We measure progress toward our targets by quantifying results independent of growth or contraction of our business .
We do not include facility or building closures or recently acquired facilities in our target progress .
Our 2021 environmental data have undergone a reasonable assurance audit .
Highlights of our environmental performance are presented below; more detailed data can be found here .
"ENERGY In 2021, we increased the amount of renewable energy in our purchased electricity to 79% compared to 41% in 2020 ."
"We purchased in-country renewable energy certificates to make our facilities in Thousand Oaks, CA; West Greenwich, RI; Louisville, KY; Cambridge, MA; Breda, Netherlands; and Singapore use 100% renewable electricity ."
This is in addition to our GreenPower Purchase Plans with local utilities at our facility in Ireland and our two locations in Great Britain .
