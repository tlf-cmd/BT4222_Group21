"Brown Vice President, Sustainability 7 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report Living the Mission: The Faces of Linde 8 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report About Linde Mission, Vision and Values Linde 's Sustainable Development Report (SDR) demonstrates how we deliver on our mission of making our world more productive ."
"We live our mission every day by providing high-quality solutions, technologies and services that are making our customers more successful and helping to sustain and protect our planet."
"Our vision is to be the best performing global industrial gases and engineering company, where our people deliver innovative and sustainable solutions for our customers in a connected world."
"Lindes values are safety, integrity, community, inclusion and accountability."
Ethics and Integrity 102-16 Responsible corporate governance is a key prerequisite for Lindes business success.
"This means ensuring compliance with the law, rules and regulations, and voluntary commitments."
Linde strives continuously to achieve its goals ethically and with the highest integrity.
"Interaction between management, employees and Lindes business partners is expected to be transparent and respectful, consistent with our Code of Business Integrity (CBI)."
"Lindes governance of ethics and integrity is described in the management approach section for Material Economic Aspects, page 45."
Organization Linde is a leading global industrial gases and engineering company with 2021 sales of $31 billion.
The reporting currency is the U.
S. dollar.
All amounts are shown in U.
"S. dollars ($), unless stated otherwise."
"The company employs more than 72,000 people globally and serves a diverse group of industries in approximately 100 countries."
"Approximately 84 percent of Lindes 2021 sales were generated from industrial gases operations in three geographic segmentsAmericas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific (APAC)."
"The remaining 16 percent is related primarily to the Engineering segment, and to a lesser extent, Other operating segments."
"Business Model 102-2, 102-9 Lindes business model is to transform air and other process gases into applications that, in many cases, help customers become more energy and resource efficient or provide social benefits."
"Lindes industrial gas processes transform natural resources into environmental and social value and impact; see the Business Model table, page 10."
"Principal business operations are to make atmospheric gases from raw materials in the air and electricity, and process gases, mainly hydrogen, from natural gas or industry byproducts, together with steam."
"The outputs of these processes, or our product applications, serve multiple end markets."
"More than two thirds of sales are underpinned by fixed fees or resilient end-markets (e.g., healthcare, food and beverage, electronics), as well as portions of sales to chemicals and energy, metals and manufacturing, which provide some protection from market swings."
"Many of Linde 's applications bring environmental, economic and social benefits to our customers, communities and the planet."
"Our ""sustainability portfolio "" applications are shown in the "" Outputs "" rows, by end market."
"The benefits that they enable are shown in the ""Outcomes "" rows, by gas."
"For example, Lindes oxygen helps steelmakers save energy, allows sustainable aquaculture to thrive and serves hundreds of thousands of patients needing medical oxygen."
"Its hydrogen helps oil refiners to make ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD), which helps improve air quality, thereby improving the environment and human health."
Linde 's high-performance surface coatings help improve energy efficiency in jet engines and machine turbines.
These outcomes deliver multiple longer-term impacts and sustainable business value.
"For more information about the companys business model and products and services, please visit http:/ /www.linde.com/ ."
"Creating Economic, Environmental and Social Value Lindes business model creates additional enduring value that amplifies our mission of making our world more productive ."

"For example, Linde values the safety of its employees and contractors and invested approximately 5 million hours of safety training in 2021."
"One outcome of this effort is that Lindes safety record is several times better than industry benchmarks, which gives us confidence that our employees and contractors return home safely at the end of their day."
Lindes products contribute positively to the health and wellbeing of our customers.
"Homecare and hospital patients worldwide benefit from our medical gases, devices, services and therapies, especially in respiratory care."
"For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Linde medical oxygen was crucial to healthcare responders and their patients in many countries."
"In the United States, Lincare is a leading provider of home respiratory-therapy products and services."
Linde gases also play an important role in tackling the global challenge of access to clean water.
"An ever-growing population and industrial activity, along with stringent environmental regulations, puts additional pressure on wastewater treatment plants across the globe to treat increasing volumes of wastewateradding oxygen effectively increases plant capacity."
"As access to drinking water becomes more scarce, the market for desalination has expanded, particularly in drought-susceptible areas."
"Carbon dioxide, which is often sourced from industry byproducts, can be used in the re-mineralization step as a safer alternative to mineral acids."
"In Australia and other areas, for example, Linde carbon dioxide helps desalinate water used for municipal water supplies."
"In 2021, Linde gases enabled more than 225 million people to have access to safe drinking water, more than half of whom were in APAC (approximately 130 million people)."
The long-term impact of these activities is difficult to measure or attribute directly to one company.
"However, we can demonstrate how they contribute to the 17 global United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) introduced by the UN to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for all by 2030."
"The "" Impact "" column of the table on page 11 shows the SDGs most relevant to Linde, which are referenced in Lindes Sustainable Development targets."
"There are many examples of how Linde's activities contribute towards the SDGs, including efforts to further SDG 12: Responsible Production and Consumption."
"SDG 12.2 is "" By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. """
Linde 's broad range of resource intensity targets address this issue.
"The company also takes direct action on SDG 12.6: "" Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle. """
"In the table, we can observe, for example, how Linde contributes to SDG 7.2: ""Increase the share of renewable energy by 2030."""
Linde will actively contribute to this target by doubling the purchase of low-carbon energy by 2028.
Please refer to page 26 for more details on this target.10 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report Business Model 102-2 This chart provides some examples of the applications and benefits from some of Linde's products.

"See 103-1, 103-2 and 103-3 for management discussion and analysis (MD&A) for economic, environmental and social topics."
Reporting Frameworks Applied This report draws on these voluntary reporting frameworks: GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI SRSs): This report has been prepared in Accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option.
"For the GRI Content Index Service, GRI Services reviewed that the GRI Content Index is clearly presented and the references for all disclosures included align with the appropriate sections in the body of the report."
See the Content Index at the end of this report.
Those standards that are considered material are marked within this Annex by the following symbol: 1.
The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework was used to ensure that disclosures about climate change are linked to information about financial performance in mainstream financial reports.
See Linde TCFD Index at: https:/ /www.linde.com/ about-linde/sustainable-development/reporting-center .
2.
The International Integrated Reporting Framework provides a framework for investors and other stakeholders to gain greater 13 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report insight into the medium- and long-term sustainability of a company.
"It proposes that a company should report how it manages all its six capital flows: financial capital as well as human, intellectual, manufactured, natural, and social and relationship (sometimes referred to collectively as ""social capital""), and the connectivity between them."
3.
"Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standard for the Chemicals Sector (Version 2018-10): This provides sector standards and KPIs that are considered materially relevant to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investors."
See Linde SASB Index at: https:/ /www.linde.com/about-linde/sustainable-development/ reporting-center .
102-48 Restatements of information The following are restatements from the Linde's 2020 Sustainable Development Report: Usage of compressed air for power was formerly reported in Scope 2.
This is now reported in Scope 3 as this is not procured electricity.
Linde continues to move to market-based emissions factors where possible.
Restatements are made in accordance with its GHG Recalculation policy .
"Linde has updated its Scope 2 emissions for 2018, 2019 and 2020."
"As a result of the use of updated market-based emissions factors, the following values have been restated accordingly for 2018, 2019 and 2020: renewable and low-carbon energy, fossil fuel electricity."
These recalculations affect the GHG intensity and reported proportion of renewable and low-carbon energy represented in total purchased electricity.
Waste values have been restated for 2020 due to a reporting update for non-hazardous waste in North Latin America.
"Linde is restating VOC emissions for 2018, 2019 and 2020 due to the discovery of an additional source of VOCs affecting one site's reporting."
"For full tranparency, prior years have been restated."
102-49 Changes in reporting See 102-48 for restatements Reporting Pro Forma 2018 and Reporting of Numbers for Lindes SD 2028 Targets Data is reported consistent with Lindes 2020 Sustainable Development Report and utilizes pro forma information.
"Pro forma definition: Pro forma means a calculated number or result that is not related to the official financial boundaries, reporting scope or period."
A pro forma number serves as an indicator of what the result of a newly merged company would theoretically look like if the new company had reported for the complete year and applied new company reporting boundaries and methodologies.
"As an example, financial reporting for 2018 was based on a full year of Linde Inc. (formerly named Praxair, Inc.) results plus two months of Linde GmbH (previously Linde AG), as the merger legally took place at the end of October 2018."
"The 2018 pro forma result, in contrast, reflects the complete combined 2018 calendar year."
"14 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 2028 Sustainable Development Targets* * For more information about all of Linde's SD 2028 targets, pleas visit our website at www.linde.com/sustainable-development/targets-and-performance15 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 2028 Sustainable Development Targets*Materiality, Priorities and Targets: SD 2028 102-47 Lindes ambitious Sustainable Development 2028 (SD 2028) targets are our roadmap and plan for the next several years."
"The targets are organized in four categories, or Priority Factors (PFs), that we consider relevant to the company and its internal and external stakeholders: Climate Change; Safety, Health & Environment; People & Community; and Integrity & Compliance."
The PFs are shown in the box: Priority Factors.
Within the four PFs are 10 subset areas covering 20 targets.
"The Climate Change targets span Lindes full value chain, from pre- investment and R&D to operations, customers and growth strategy."
These are discussed in the Climate Change section.
"Our PF for Safety, Health & Environment is supported by targets for personnel safety, distribution safety and product safety, and in the environment area, for sustainable productivity, water and waste."
"The People & Community PF has targets for diversity and inclusion, community engagement and global giving."
"In the Integrity & Compliance category, we are targeting 100 percent of employees and contractors certified in our code of ethics and compliance."
This set of targets has several features worth noting: 1.
"Commencing in 2018, they are 10-year targets that set a long-term strategy for sustainable development at Linde."
"They are consistent with Lindes business model, its mission and values, and the strategic business objectives named by the Board as a basis for variable compensation."
2.
Lindes businesses and functions are accountable to deliver these targets.
They are embedded into our businesses and operations.
Each target is a business KPI and managed as part of the business.
3.
The targets were developed with reference to external expectations.
"These include ESG investors, who look for non- financial information as the basis to make better informed investor decisions, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)."
They were also developed with stakeholders interested in understanding Lindes impacts within the context of global needs and planetary boundaries (such as described by the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards and the UN SDGs).
"Our SD targets contribute to several SDGs, as shown in the table on value creation on page 11, and in the Targets table."
"Linde publishes indexes that show how its SD strategy and targets align with the GRI Standards, TCFD and SASB; and an ESG Report Summary for Investors."

"17 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 18 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report The effects of climate change are increasingly visible on the environment, society and the global economy."
Climate change is not a distant threat.
It is happening now.
"Linde has the technology, resources and people to help address climate change."
"For more than 100 years, we have been providing solutions to help solve global energy challenges."
Our companys mission of making our world more productive is fully aligned with the goals of addressing the global challenges of sustainable energy and climate change.
"Through our high-quality solutions, products, technologies and services, we are making our customers more successful and helping to sustain and protect our planet."
TODAY Linde is in the business of resource transformation.
We use fuels for energy and as feedstock.
"Our business and production processes are therefore energy-intensive, making the cost and availability of energy important for Linde."
"Our total carbon footprint in 2021 was about 39.9 million tons of COe, where 41 percent stems from direct carbon dioxide emissions, mostly from our hydrogen plants, and 59 percent from indirect emissions from our electricity consumption, mostly from air separation."
"This energy use, in turn, delivers innovative and sustainable solutions for our customers."
"In many cases, these solutions improve the productivity, energy use and GHG emissions for our customers or end users."
"In fact, we calculate that in 2021, Linde gases, principally oxygen and hydrogen, enabled our customers to avoid 88 million metric tons of COe, which is more than twice as much GHG avoided than emitted from all our operations."
See page 20.
"As the electric grid decarbonizes by using more low-carbon and renewable sources, Lindes indirect GHG emissions will decrease."
"In addition, Linde actively contributes to grid decarbonization in multiple ways: Lindes business proposition is that it is more reliable and more energy efficient for our customers to outsource the production of industrial gases than to insource."
"Lindes energy efficiency is world-class, and we continue to improve it each year, which leads to financial savings as well as reductions in energy and GHG emissions. "
Many of Lindes cryogenic air separation (ASU) plants are designed to include buffer inventories to retain reliable supply in case of power failure.
This has allowed Linde to participate in demand- response programs.
"In periods of peak energy demand, Linde can interrupt its grid power use and effectively reduce grid electric load (by the equivalent of 40,000 homes from a single location)."
Lindes design investment can provide ancillary service for grid operators to maintain reliable electric power service as wind and solar energy become a greater part of our resource mix.
Forty percent of all Linde electricity (17 TWh) is currently sourced from low-carbon and renewable power.
"Of that, 3.5 TWh is directly or actively sourced."
Linde electricity use in the UK is almost 100 percent renewable using wind and almost 100 percent in Brazil using hydroelectric.
"Low-carbon and renewable electricity is also sourced in the United States, where both hydro and nuclear power are used, as well as in Colombia, India, Spain, the Philippines and other geographies."
Hydrogen is a key enabler of the clean energy transition.
"It is a versatile, clean and safe energy carrier that can be used as fuel for power or in the industry as feedstock."
"At the point of use, it produces zero emissions, and it can be stored and transported at high energy density in liquid or gaseous form."
It can be combusted or used in fuel cells to generate heat and electricity.
We are at the beginning of this transition.
"Conventional processes are dominant today in refining, chemical production and other manufacturing processes (steel, electronics and other applications)."
"R&D and emerging technologies are starting to change the landscape, but hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) are not yet widely adopted, green fuels and materials are still at pilot stages and hydrogen for energy storage is still in the development stage."
"Most hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming (SMR) using natural gas, or recovered as a byproduct from other industrial processes."
"Water electrolysis is emerging as an effective low-carbon source of hydrogen production, but SMRs remain the dominant technology to produce hydrogen on a large scale."
Climate ChangeChallenge & Opportunity19 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report Key Actions to 2035 and Beyond!
"Developing Science-Based Targets In October 2021, Linde announced its new 35 by 35 target, committing to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 35 percent by 2035 compared to 2021 emissions as a baseline, and a defined roadmap to achieve climate neutrality by 2050."
"These targets reflect Lindes alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement and culminated nearly a year of work between Lindes business segments, Energy Management, Clean Energy, Sustainability and R&D."
Corporate Fellow Minish Shah led the modeling of GHG trajectories to ensure alignment with well- below 2 degrees scenario.
Increasing Renewable Energy Utilization Lindes energy management team in India signed several long- term power contracts in 2021 to source renewable energy by setting up photovoltaic systems and wind turbines at nine ASU sites.
"These contracts, which are in various stages of implementation, help Linde source at a rate that is less expensive than if obtained from the grid."
All projects are planned to be fully commissioned by 2024.
"BS Anuradha, who is Associate Director of Power Management, and all the team members are proud of these efforts, which will more than triple renewable energy as compared to 2021 and reduce Scope 2 GHG emissions by 20 percent!"
"Going Linde Green In eight European countries, all of Lindes electricity purchases from the grid are zero-carbon."
"Additionally, in 2021, Linde put in place an agreement to supply nitrogen generated from renewable electricity to one of the largest pipeline customers in Europe and extended its Linde Green product range of liquefied gases with zero-carbon impact to more countries."
"To guarantee a pipeline of additional renewable, Linde has continued to negotiate more long-term Power Purchase Agreements, including in Sweden, where power from Statkrafts hydropower plant in Bassalt, pictured above, came online in 2022."
Picture credit: Statkraft Lowering Fleet Emissions One part of Lindes vision for 2050 is a zero-emissions fleet.
"Linde has already taken steps, including evaluations of both hydrogen fuel cell- and electric-powered vehicles."
"Working together with fuel manufacturers, Linde Gas & Equipment has evaluated renewable diesel, which in many cases, can be phased in progressively without modification to truck engines."
"Testing of this technology has begun in some geographies, including California, Washington and Oregon."
GHG emissions from transportation can be reduced by up to 83 percent using renewable diesel compared to fossil diesel.
20 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 11 million MT CO2e avoided from coatings for thermal barriers for industrial gas turbine and jet engine efficiency 3 million MT CO2e avoided from Kr in windows and Ar in welding 62 million MT CO2e avoided from H2 for ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) 12 million MT CO2e avoided from O2 for steelmaking Values are based on 2021 reported and consolidated results from Linde plc subsidiaries following Linde plc reporting standards.
CO2e = CO2 equivalentsLinde is a company in the business of resource transformation in a world that is dealing with climate change.
Below are our 2021 actual results as reported by Linde plc entities.
We demonstrate that a subset of Linde applications allow our customers or their end users to avoid more than twice the GHG emissions of all Linde operations.
"In 2021, total GHG emissions were 39,9 million MT CO2e, versus 88 million MT CO2e avoided by our customers or end users, based upon several applications as shown below."
"88 million MT CO2e benefits enabled by Linde applications for customers and end usersApplications Enable 2.2x Carbon Productivity 23.6 million MT CO2e Scope 2 indirect GHG emissions emitted mainly from the power consumed at air separation plants16.3 million MT COe Scope 1 GHG emissions: 11.4 million MT from hydrogen production, 4.9 million from other GHG emissions, driving and natural gas use39.9 million MT CO2e Linde GHG footprint 0Again in 2021, a subset of Linde applications enabled more than twice the GHG benefit than was emitted in all global operations.21 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe."
"Even though it is light and small, hydrogen is a powerful energy carrier and can, for example, be used to store excess renewable energy."
"Hydrogen is transported underground through extensive pipeline networks or by truck, as a cryogenic liquid or high-pressure gas, to be used in a wide range of applications, from mobility to heavy industries."
"Due to its versatility, hydrogen is proving to be a key enabler of the transition to low and zero-carbon energy (clean energy), to help meet climate change targets."
"At Linde, we have been harnessing the power of hydrogen for over 100 years and are making continued investments in effective and economic ways to deliver gray, blue and, ultimately, green hydrogen."
We can produce hydrogen from a range of feedstocks and natural resources.
"Using processes like steam reforming, we generate gray hydrogen from natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or naphtha."
This is the most common hydrogen production process today.
Gray hydrogen can be converted into blue hydrogen by adding carbon capture and storage technologies to the production process.
We produce green hydrogen using electrolysis powered by renewable energy.
An alternative green hydrogen production method is steam reforming using biomethane as feedstock.
Gray and blue hydrogen are important steppingstones on the path to green hydrogen as they allow the necessary frameworks and infrastructures to be developed in the interim while green hydrogen production reaches the necessary scale.
"As the worlds leading industrial gas and engineering company, Linde covers the full spectrum of the hydrogen value chain."
We can help customers and stakeholders navigate through the complexities of the transition to a zero-carbon economy.
"Our engineers work with customers in identifying their path to zero emissions and Linde has become a leader in designing, building and operating plants and facilities to meet our customers needs."
"Clean hydrogen is a cornerstone of our Clean Energy strategy which is built around 1) providing solutions to mitigate and manage carbon emissions, and 2) developing clean hydrogen technologies to facilitate the transition to low-carbon fuels and applications."
We are aligned with the Paris Accords and contribute to accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy.
"We also support the TCFD, an Index showing the alignment between Lindes reporting and the TCFD Guidelines which is available at: https:/ /www.linde.com/about-linde/ sustainabledevelopment/reporting center ."
"Advocacy is another way in which we actively drive the transition to clean energy: Linde is a founding member of the Hydrogen Council and participates in many other hydrogen and climate change forums and advocacy groups, such as the Sustainable Markets Initiative and the Hydrogen Forward Coalition."
"Today, Linde has the largest liquid hydrogen production capacity and distribution system in the world."
"We also operate the world's first commercial high-purity hydrogen storage cavern, which, coupled with an unrivaled pipeline network of approximately 1,000 kilometers, enables us to reliably supply our customers."
"With more than 200 hydrogen refueling stations and 80 hydrogen electrolysis plants installed worldwide, we are at the forefront of the energy transition."
"Leading the Transition to Low Carbon Energy Lindes Capabilities Across the Hydrogen Value Chain22 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report Lindes Pathway to Climate Neutrality: 2028, 2035, 2050 The next three decades will represent a period of great activity for the world and the quest to address climate change."
"Our strategy includes three milestones, 2028, 2035, and 2050, and that strategy is based upon a vision of the evolution across the world during this period."
2028: Our assumptions for this time horizon are that industrial-level decarbonization continues to accelerate.
New technologies will be piloted and demonstrated.
"Green fuels and materials will be scaling, and the feasibility for hydrogen usage as an agent of decarbonization in multiple applications will be growing."
SMRs will continue to be used for most large-scale hydrogen production.
"They will become more efficient, and many will incorporate carbon capture and/or use feedstocks and power from renewable sources."
Electrolysis for green hydrogen production from renewable power will be available at capacities greater than 100 MW.
Linde's six climate change targets through 2028 (with a 2018 baseline) follow the full value chain from investment to customer and environmental benefits.
They are consistent with Lindes mission and are critical to continuing the company's sustainability leadership.
These are management targets; our businesses are accountable for achieving them.
Linde will invest more than $1 billion in decarbonization initiatives and triple the amount of clean hydrogen production.
The company is investing across the hydrogen value chain to accelerate the clean energy transition with a higher global renewable power mix and significant operating and capital efficiencies.
"We will pursue competitive low-carbon sources of hydrogen, including energy efficient SMRs and ATRs with carbon capture, electrolysis with renewable power, and pilot new low-carbon technologies."
Our R&D will have a decarbonization focus.
"Key projects include advanced thermal barrier coatings and advanced sealing technologies; improving global plant efficiency, energy optimization, logistics and operations optimization; and flexible operations to support demand- side management and allow for higher utilization of renewably produced electrical power."
It also includes the development of alternative gas separation technologies to allow alternative process concepts with higher efficiency and a lower carbon footprint.
"In the steel industry, projects include the decarbonization of the integrated mill, heat recovery, direct reduced iron technologies and electrochemistry initiatives."
Not all barriers to decarbonization can be overcome in the short term.
"However, we will continue to invest in optimizing operational efficiency to meet our commitment to substantially increase our focus on low-carbon and renewable energy to continue reducing carbon emissions."
The SD 2028 target of 35 percent improvement in Linde GHG intensity 2018 2028 is measured against adjusted EBITDA*.
This target was chosen to show efficiency against a business denominator.
EBITDA is one of the non-GAAP measures reported by Linde plc.
"Achieving this target will depend on a range of external variables that are not in our control, from global economic trends to government regulations to currency fluctuations."
We remain committed to managing business growth while optimizing operational GHG emissions.
"In 2021, Linde reduced its GHG intensity by 26 percent from the baseline year; see Performance Towards Targets."
In relation to Scope 1 or direct GHG * Scope 1 and 2 emissions (in million MT) divided by adjusted EBITDA in billion USD.
Calculation for 2018 uses adjusted pro forma EBITDA.
Calculation for 2019 onward uses adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

"In relation to Scope 2 or indirect GHG emissions, Linde aims to improve its operational efficiency and GHG intensity at ASU plants (7 percent within the target horizon)."
Linde's largest medium-term opportunity to affect its GHG footprint is in Scope 2 electricity.
"We continue to leverage our scale and geographic distribution to procure reliable and affordable sources of renewable electricity through active procurement of new direct renewable energy contracts, Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)."
"By 2028, we expect to have achieved: 35 percent improvement in GHG intensity versus EBITDA from 5.31 to 3.45."
Hold Scope 2 GHG emissions flat or reduced at the same time as we substantially increase our power use.
More than 2x low-carbon power procured.
"Overall, renewable energy and low-carbon energy sources are projected to increase from 35 percent to more than 50 percent (all power)."
Development of blue and/or green hydrogen projects.
"We have implemented several additional measures to help us better manage our carbon footprint, achieve our long-term targets, and assess the long-term risks of climate change."
Linde's Clean Energy organization was launched to focus and accelerate activity in this area.
The GHG emissions from new investments are calculated and integrated into considerations in Capital Investment Committee decisions for every project.
They are then considered in the selection of the technology solution and project risks across the project development cycle.
"To help mitigate potential physical risks from climate change, Linde has developed a tool to explore future climate change scenarios that could impose additional operational costs on production processes from factors like higher ambient temperature or air quality deterioration/higher carbon dioxide parts per million (PPMs) in the atmosphere at our locations."
Physical risks are considered in planning.
Impacts and mitigations are considered as part of periodic business reviews.
"2035: In 2028, the target horizon for our 10-year managed climate objectives will end."
Linde has recognized the degree of its stakeholders' interest in climate change and the importance of impact globally.
"The company responded in 2021: Teams assessed then-current targets and began working on more aggressive goals, as well as the plans to achieve."
Our 2035 target is science-based and aligned with the Paris Accords goal to reduce global warming to well below 2C.
"Linde continues efforts toward validation of this target and has worked with others in industry through the first SBT Chemicals Stakeholder Advisory Group, which is the working group that is developing guidance for the chemicals sector."
(More information is available at: https:/ /sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action/ .)
"As our latest climate commitment demonstrates, we are active in advancing the world towards ambitious GHG reduction in the chemical industry using scenario analysis (utilizing Sustainable Development Scenario)."
We can envision a future where hydrogen fuel cells will be widely adopted; green electricity will be available commercially; and energy and fuel markets will be linked.
Low-carbon hydrogen will be cost competitive; SMRs will feature additional energy efficiency and CCS; and electrolysis will be available with renewable electricity sources at much greater capacities and will supply a significant share of new hydrogen demand.
"By 2035, we expect that hydrogen derivatives will become the new energy vector and an essential means to transport low-cost renewable power around the world."
"Achieving this objective will require changes in societal behaviors, government regulation, industry engagement and technology development."
Linde will continue to participate in the investments and technologies that will reduce global GHG emissions.
"By 2035, we expect to have achieved: 35 percent reduction in absolute GHG emissions from our 2021 inventory."
More than 3x low-carbon power procured.
"Execution of CCS projects at some of Linde's largest SMRs that will, with other efficiency efforts, reduce Scope 1 emissions."
"2050: The world is at the beginning of an energy transformation, and Lindes climate neutrality ambition demonstrates our long-term commitment to be an active contributor to the transformation."
Our vision for 2050 includes widespread availability of renewable and low-carbon energy and alternative technologies for production and distribution.
"Lindes 2050 climate neutrality ambition is based upon IEAs scenario analysis, as described in its latest 2020 ETP paper."
"This well-below 2 degrees Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) recognized that the chemical sector as a whole is one that is hard to abate and projects the GHG trajectory for this industry as declining after 2030, reaching net zero after 2070."
"Lindes trajectory foresees a much earlier decline in absolute emissions, reaching climate neutrality by 2050."
"Analysis shows that this trajectory equates to an average decline of 4 percent of emissions per year, as compared to business-as-usual emissions."
"Therefore, Linde considers its 2050 net zero goal to be in line with the global goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees."
Tackling climate change is a shared and global responsibility.
"The long-term effects of carbon-based fuels on the environment and climate require significant changes to the energy supply chain, regulations and society."
Linde is poised to contribute across all aspects of managing climate change and reducing GHG emissions.
"24 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report Lindes 2028 Sustainable Development (SD 2028) targets set a long-term, 10-year action plan with commitments from leadership and all levels of the organization."
"These are managed targets with clear accountability, ongoing reporting to management, and an annual process of review and continuous improvement."
These target areas are consistent with Lindes strategic non-financial business objectives considered in determining executive variable compensation awards.
"Performance against this full slate of targets is reported quarterly to executive leadership, and at least once a year to the full Board of Directors."
Operational performance towards targets is reported on a monthly basis to management.
"Linde began providing ESG performance results versus its climate change targets in 2020, the only chemicals company on the DAX and S&P 500 to report quarterly ESG performance against its targets."
"Most targets run from the 2018 base year, the first year of our combined company, for 10 years to 2028."
This chapter provides a summary dashboard of the SD 2028 targets and performance against these targets for 2021.
"In 2021, Linde announced an additional climate change target, 35 by 35, which is a commitment to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 35 percent in 2035."
"This managed target runs from the 2021 base year, and performance against this target will be provided in future reporting."

"Invest >$1 billion in decarbonization initiatives The scope is capital projects of more than $2 million, where the primary aim of Linde and/or its customers is to reduce GHG emissions or advance the use of low-carbon fuels and energy."
"Since 2018, Linde has invested a cumulative $299 million."
"For 2021, this includes investment in Lindes first PEM electrolyzer facility in North America, in Niagara Falls, NY."
Direct at least one-third of Lindes annual R&D budget to decarbonization The scope includes annual spend to develop lower-carbon technology for Linde assets or to develop lower-carbon solutions for our customers.
Linde invested 27 percent of its 2021 R&D budget ($144 million) into decarbonization (2020: 26 percent).
"Initiatives include developing industry-leading carbon capture technologies, investing in promising green hydrogen technologies and driving operational efficiency to further reduce GHG intensity."
Contribute more than 50 percent of revenue from our Sustainability Portfolio The scope is annual Linde revenue associated with the sale of gases in applications that bring environmental and/or social benefits; see the Business Model table.
"In 2021, Linde generated 55 percent of gases revenue, or $15 billion, from its Sustainability Portfolio."
The Sustainability Portfolio includes sales from Lindes eco-portfolio ($10 billion) and social portfolio ($5 billion).
"The eco-portfolio includes applications that have environmental and social benefits, such as oxygen for blast furnaces in steel; hydrogen for utra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD); and oxygen and carbon dioxide for wastewater treatment, desalination and aquaculture."
The social portfolio includes applications with target social benefits.
Examples are oxygen for respiratory care and helium for MRI technology.
"For the eco-portfolio, R&D developed a simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)-based screening methodology to determine and update which applications are included."
"A simplified LCA includes part of the four stages of a product lifecycle of raw material acquisition, manufacturing, use/reuse/maintenance and recycle/waste management (e.g., it assesses one or two of the stages completely, or analyzes all four stages to lesser depth)."
"All (100 percent) of Lindes products under development were evaluated in-depth in the first three stages (e.g., cradle to grave)."
"For environmental impacts, we use Environmental Key Performance Indicators (EKPIs): energy (electricity, natural gas and fuel); air emissions and direct and indirect GHG emissions; waste (hazardous and non-hazardous); water; and ozone depleting substances (ODSs)."
"Enable >2X more GHG to be avoided per year than are emitted in all Linde operations The scope is GHG benefits from a subset of Linde applications that enable demonstrable GHG benefits, versus Lindes 2021 total direct and indirect (Scopes 1 and 2) GHG emissions."
"In 2021, a subset of its applications enabled 88 million MT COe to be avoided48 million MT more than its GHG emissions or 2.2x times more."
See Linde Applications Enable 2.2x Carbon Productivity.
Methodology: End-user-avoided carbon dioxide emissions are calculated in accordance with the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) guidelines.
Avoided emissions arise from efforts by multiple partners along the respective value chains.
Lindes contribution has been characterized as fundamental in enabling the avoided emissions.
"See ""Addressing the Avoided Emissions Challenge: Guidelines from the chemical industry for accounting for and reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions avoided along the value chain based on comparative studies,"" ICCA October, 2003 (updated 2017), at: https://icca-chem."

"*All Targets terminate in 2028, unless specified otherwise26 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report Optimize Operational Energy Use and GHG Emissions Lindes 2021 Scope 1 GHG emissions were 16.3 MM MT COe."
"This represents a slight increase in emissions compared to 2020 by 0.5 percent, driven by an increase of hydrogen production, offset by improved HyCO GHG intensity due to higher byproduct sourcing."
Results were also impacted by a considerable decrease in other GHG emissions; see Other GHG emissions reduction target.
Scope 1 GHG emissions were caused mainly (70 percent) by hydrogen production in SMRs.
"An additional 21 percent is derived from ASUs or other production operations, where plants run on natural gas."
"Approximately 5 percent of Scope 1 emission were caused by other sources of GHG (e.g., nitrous oxide or other plants), and 4 percent is from driving."
"Targets to improve GHG intensity in hydrogen production, other GHG emissions and driving address those emissions."
Lindes Scope 2 GHG emissions were 23.6 MM MT COe.
This represents a 5.7 percent increase versus 2020.
"The 2021 result is driven by higher production volumes, offset by efficiency improvements."
The value reflects increased usage of market-based emissions factors for several plants that previously used location-based factors.
"Scope 2 GHG emissions are caused by the use of electricity and steam, a portion of which comes from fossil fuel sources."
Electricity is principally (90 percent) used by air separation plants and is tracked with the air separation energy efficiency target.
An additional 5 percent of the electricity is used in hydrogen production.
Targets to improve energy efficiency in ASUs and to increase low-carbon power sourcing address this issue.
"In order to show GHG efficiency against a business denominator, Linde selected EBITDA, which is one of the non-GAAP measures reported by Linde plc."
It reflects the size of the business for which the emissions are being reported and the efficiency improvements that are being targeted.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.
"For definition and reconciliation, please see Appendix to the Investor Teleconference Presentation Fourth Quarter 2021."
Lindes 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $10.2 billion.
This GHG intensity analysis complements the absolute GHG reduction target announced in 2021.
Achieve a 35 percent absolute reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 The scope is all Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions for Linde globally.
The target is aligned with the Paris Accords goal to limit global warming to well below 2C.
Progress against this new target will be reported in Lindes 2022 Sustainable Development Report.
Achieve 35 percent GHG intensity improvement versus EBITDA The scope is Lindes combined Scope 1 + Scope 2 GHG emissions versus EBITDA.
"In 2021, Lindes GHG intensity was 3.9 MMT COe/$ billion, representing 26 percent GHG intensity improvement over 2018, resulting from increased renewable energy availability and sourcing as well as strong EBITDA growth as a consequence of increased production and turnover."
"In early 2022, Linde estimated an improvement of 24 percent."
"Upon final audit, improvement was confirmed to be 26 percent."
"Achieve 7 percent improvement in ASU energy intensity The scope is Linde ASU facilities worldwide where Linde pays for the power and has operational control, including 50 percent majority-held joint ventures."
"The 2021 results represented a strong improvement versus 2020, from 0.5 percent cumulative reduction to 1.7 percent."
This progress partly compensates the negative productivity impacts from lower production volumes during the pandemic.
"The improvements were achieved through targeted productivity efforts and capital investments, along with the startup of large plants incorporating state- of-the-art ASU equipment and processes."
"See GRI 302-1 for information on electricity consumption, GRI 302-3 for energy intensity, and GRI 302-4 for energy reduction activities."
Achieve 4 percent improvement in hydrogen GHG intensity The scope is Linde hydrogen facilities worldwide.
"The 2021 results were a 9.3 percent improvement versus 2018 (4 percent YOY), mainly due to increased byproduct sourcing in 2021."
Performance against this target was not expected to be linear.
"It reflects changes in production volumes ,the effect of project startups, the implementation of projected technology innovations, and an increase in byproduct hydrogen sourced."
Achieve 10 percent improvement in trucking GHG emissions intensity The scope is all Linde commercial driving operations (bulk and packaged gases combined) where the driver is a Linde employee.
The 2021 results were a 7.5 cumulative percent GHG intensity improvement against the baseline.
The target is calculated by multiplying the number of miles driven and fuel used in each geography by GHG emissions factors and dividing by volume of product delivered.
"2021 performance continued to improve due to logistics efficiency projects, fleet renewal and new technology deploymentdespite efficiency pressure effects from various government-imposed COVID-related minimum supply chain stocking levels."
Contractor driving is reported as Scope 3 at GRI 305-3.
"Achieve a 10 percent absolute reduction in other GHG emissions The scope is most other GHG emissions from a range of Scope 1 GHG emissions sources, calculated into CO equivalentsrefrigerant losses from cylinder refilling operations; NO emissions from NO plants and cylinder filling; and methane releases from helium and CO plants, which account for most of Lindes other GHG emissions."
"In 2021, these emissions were 0.9 MM MT COe (2020: 1.5)."
"2021 results were a 38 percent improvement over the baseline, representing an early achievement of the target, which was originally set for 2028."
This performance improvement was achieved by best practices and programs in refrigerants and NO.
"Methane improvement is due to new recovery and use processes, among other factors."
">2x low-carbon power sourcing, primarily from active renewable electricity The scope is all Linde operations within our GHG reporting boundary."
The target is on track.
"In 2021, the company sourced 17 million MWh low-carbon energy, or 40 percent of all its purchased electricity."
Progress on this target was not expected to be linear.
"Low-carbon electricity is defined as electricity produced from non-fossil sources including renewables (e.g., solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro) and other low-carbon sources."
"The target includes passive electricity (e.g., from the grid) and active sourcing over PPAs, RECs, certificates and sourcing contracts for specific facilities."
It considers all energy consumption where Linde purchases the electricity.
It excludes electricity where Linde is not the purchaser.
Linde actively sourced 2.8 TWh renewable electricity and 0.7 TWh low- carbon power in 2021.
Linde electricity use in the UK is almost 100 percent renewable using wind and almost 100 percent in Brazil using hydroelectric.
"Low-carbon and renewable electricity is also sourced in the United States, where both hydro and nuclear power are used, as well as in Colombia, India, Spain, the Philippines and other geographies.27 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report Safety, Health & Environment 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 Priority Factors Linde Targets* 2018 2019 2020 2021 Target Status $1.3 billion in sustainable productivity, cumulative $ million92 176.5 310 497 1,300 Water Management Plans (WMPs) at high-water-use sites in areas of high-water stress (# sites in scope, % WMPs implemented)n/a 22 (73%) 67 (20%) 67 (36%) 100% Achieve Zero Waste to Landfill at 450 sites 217 210 286 360 450 Annually achieve operational safety better than industry levels for Lost Workday Case Rate (LWCR)0.32 0.23 0.21 0.22 1.00 Annually achieve annual operational safety better than industry levels for Total Recordable Case Rate (TRCR)0.74 0.57 0.51 0.54 3.10 Annually achieve Commercial Vehicle Incident Rate (CVIR) of <2.5 per million kilometers driven2.05 2.17 1.7 2.08 <2.50 Zero global sales of coating slurries that contain hexavalent chrome by 2029 (Surface Coatings)On track, see reporting section following achieved; on track; behind targetSafety, Health & Environment Legend Environment In addition to its investment targets, aimed at addressing climate change, Linde has defined three environmental targets: sustainable productivity or eco-efficiency, reduction of waste and management of water."
All three programs are baselined with 2018 data from legacy Praxair only.
"From 2019, the data reflects the Linde plc organization."
Save $1.3 billion from sustainable productivity Sustainable productivity projects bring financial and environmental savings in Linde's EKPIs.
"The target for sustainable productivity is a cumulative savings of $1.3 billion, 2018 2028."
The 2021 results are on track to meet this target.
"Linde achieved savings of $187 million (cumulatively $497 million), or 38 percent of all targeted productivity savings."
Environmental protection costs in 2021 included approximately $13 million in capital expenditures and $42 million of expenses.
The scope is all Linde operations.
"In 2021, sustainable productivity also saved 875 million KWh, 1,800 billion BTU of natural gas, 6 million gallons of diesel fuel, approximately 24 million pounds of waste, 514 million gallons of water and 696,000 MT COe."
COe savings count projects where benefits are fully realized and projects that were implemented in 2021 and are still accruing benefits.
"Based on our experience with rolling out this program at Praxair over almost a decade from 2010, the target assumes that both reported financial savings, and their percentage contribution to all productivity, will increase from the early years of the target period, before achieving a steady state in later years."
"Implement Water Management Plans (WMPs) at high-water use sites in areas of water stress The scope is high-water use (hi-hi) sites, defined as sites exceeding 50,000 m/ year of water withdrawal, excluding once-through, non-contact cooling water."
The 2021 results are on track to meet this target: Sixty-seven sites were defined as in scope for this target in 2021.
WMPs were implemented at 36 percent of applicable sites.
Areas of water stress are defined by the WRI Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas Tool (2019 version).
We determined high stress to mean that the baseline water stress was high or extremely high.
"In addition, businesses are encouraged to voluntarily use local determinants of water risk; sites thus defined are included in this target scope."
Linde's main uses of water include cooling and boiler systems for the production of steam for the SMR process to make hydrogen.
Net freshwater consumption was 99.5 million m.
"In 2021, Linde improved its water reporting tool structure and focused on reducing water use through productivity projects."
"To enhance data quality and water intensity monitoring, Linde increased its water reporting frequency from quarterly to monthly for sites with WMPs."
The number of total sites in scope is 67.
"Nine of these sites were added voluntarily in South Latin America and APAC, based on local assessment of high-water stress."
"Of the 67 sites determined to be in scope, 36 percent implemented WMPs by the end of 2021."
"In addition to the voluntary sites in the Americas (8) and APAC (1), the remaining WMP sites are in EMEA (31), APAC (13), and the Americas (14)."
Lindes team in South Latin America has set a voluntary regional target to continuously improve their WMP site-specific water intensity performance since 2016.
They are on track to achieving this goal.
"At the end of 2021, 45 percent of the 11 WMP sites improved their water intensity results compared to the baseline year."
"They also achieved an overall water reduction of more than 400,000 ma reduction of 9.2 percent, compared to 2020."
"Investments were made to optimize cooling and boiler systems operation, to identify and repair water leaks, to collect and re- use rainwater, as well as to recover process condensate and other effluents to use it as make-up water in cooling towers."
"*All Targets terminate in 2028, unless specified otherwise28 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report SD 2028 Target: >450 sites achieve Zero Waste to Landfill The scope is all Linde operations."
"At the end of 2021, 360 sites achieved Zero Waste to Landfill."
A Zero Waste to Landfill site is defined as one that diverts more than 90 percent process waste or hazardous waste from landfills; this can include incineration for energy recovery.
"Altogether, 707 sites participated, and approximately 260 million pounds of waste was diverted from landfills."
Zero Waste to Landfill helps extend our companys mission and values and promotes circular economic practices.
"In many cases, the program brings social benefits to local communities, from education to job creation."
See GRI 306-2 for more information on waste metrics.
"In addition to Linde facilities, six regional offices retained their external recognitions for greening their offices: Bangalore, India; Seoul, South Korea; Burr Ridge, Illinois; The Woodlands, Texas; Danbury, Connecticut; and Tonawanda, New York."
See the Green Seal website at: https:/ /greenseal.org/programs/green-office- partnership .
"Safety & Health During 2021, Linde continued to align its safety and environmental standards and procedures for both work processes and product handling to enable employees around the world to execute their jobs safely and to prevent safety incidents relating to operational processes or products."
"Lindes SD 2028 targets include two for operational safety, one for distribution safety and one for product safety."
"Increases in 2021 incident rates compared to previous year are mainly due to post- COVID effects like return of staff to Linde offices and plants, higher commuting and more on-road traffic compared to 2020."
Annually achieve operational safety better than industry levels for Lost Workday Case Rate (LWCR) and Total Recordable Case Rate (TRCR).
"The scope of these targets are all Linde operations (e.g., for employees and contractors)."
"Lost Workday Case Rate (LWCR): Lindes 2021 LWCR was 0.22 (2020: 0.21), more than four times better than the OSHA all industries industrial average (1.2)."
"Lindes LWCR is defined as the number of Recordable Injury Cases (RICs) plus the number of Recordable Sickness Cases (RSCs) that result in one or more day(s) away from work as a result of a work-related incident or exposure per 200,000 hours worked (for employees and contractors)."
"Total Recordable Case Rate (TRCR): Lindes 2021 TRCR (the number of employee or contractor recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked) was 0.54 (2020: 0.51)."
Lindes 2021 TRCR was more than five times better than the OSHA all industries industrial average (2.7).
"A recordable case is defined as any recordable injury or sickness of an employee, temporary worker or contractor that results from a work- related incident or exposure per 200,000 hours worked."
"Annually achieve Commercial Vehicle Incident Rate (CVIR) of <2.5/million kilometers The scope is all operations and all employee and contractor commercial vehicle incidents at all severity levels, per million kilometers."
The annual vehicle safety target is to maintain Lindes CVIR at <2.5/million kilometers.
"In 2021, this target was achieved: Lindes global CVIR was 2.08 vehicle incidents per million kilometers (2020: 1.7)."
"Each high-severity vehicle incident is investigated, and the results from the investigation are reviewed by local leadership and Corporate SHEQ, including root cause analysis and corrective actions."
"In addition, selected high-severity incidents based on results and learnings are reviewed monthly with corporate and regional leadership."
Target scope excludes service vehicles.
"Annually, all high-severity vehicle incidents, which are defined by Linde standards and closely aligned with ICCA guidance, are reviewed."
"As part of this review, an analysis is conducted to identify improvement opportunity areas in which the learnings and conclusions, as identified from the analysis, are used to improve safety standards and/or establish new initiatives and focus areas."
"As an example, the learning and conclusions identified from the 2020 analysis resulted in additional 2021 safety initiatives in the areas of addressing driver fatigue and driver distraction in addition to a continued focus in transport contractor management and driver development programs."
Zero global sales of coating slurries that contain hexavalent chrome [Cr(VI)] by 2029.
The scope is Surface Technologies.
"Four targets were established in relation to eliminating Cr(VI)-containing slurries and replacing coatings with strontium chromate, which is currently used in several SermeTel and SermaLon coatings."
By 2019: Offer coatings free of strontium chromate.
By 2021: Offer 100 percent chrome-free slurry product alternatives to the market.
By 2024: No sales of coating slurries that contain Cr(VI) if chromefree 2020 alternatives have been developed and qualified by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).
By 2029: No sales of coating slurries that contain Cr(VI).
"These targets were prompted by the requirements of REACH*, but go beyond REACH in that they apply worldwide and will eliminate toxic substances not just in Europe, as required by REACH, but everywhere."
Surface Technologies continues to develop additional Cr(VI)-free alternatives to replace legacy SermeTel systems targeted for elimination in 2029.
"In addition to the three targets to eliminate Cr(VI)- containing slurries, Surface Technologies has expanded its focus and developed replacement coatings that are free of strontium chromate, a chemical that is currently used in several SermeTel and SermaLon coatings."
This target is on track.
"In 2019, Surface Technologies introduced replacement coatings to major OEMs, and they have been accepted and incorporated into usage, allowing the OEMs to comply with the January 2019 REACH sunset date for strontium chromate."
Cr(VI)-free products have been introduced to the market.
"As of 2021, these alternatives are available for much of the companys portfolio and under testing by several key customers in aviation and energy."
"Upon the adoption of these products by the aerospace, industrial, and oil and gas industries, we have the potential to reduce our usage of Cr(VI) containing substances of concern by an estimated 8,000 9,000 pounds annually."
"*REACH (the Registration, Evaluation and Restriction of Chemicals) is a European Union regulation that aims to improve the protection of human health and the environment through the better and earlier identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances."
"This is done by the four processes of REACH, namely the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals.29 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report Integrity & Compliance Integrity & Compliance: 100 percent certification to Linde 's Code of Business Integrity (CBI) All targeted employees are required to certify CBI compliance, except where law or regulation prohibits inclusion."

Diversity & Inclusion: Achieve 30 percent representation of women globally by 2030 The aspirational goal for Linde is to achieve 30 percent female representation at all levels in Lindes global professional employee population by 2030.
"In 2021, the overall average percentage of female professionals in the global Linde organization was 27 percent, flat with 2020 but on track to achieve this target."
"The percentage of female executives in the global Linde organization was 18 percent, an increase from 17 percent in 2020."
Women represented 28% of professional employees.
The global organizational goal of 30 percent is intended to apply at all management levels and for all business units and functions.
The scope is all Linde employees.
Inclusion is a Linde core value.
"The company embraces diversity and inclusion in order to attract, develop and retain the best talent and build high-performing teams."
"Lindes CBI states that employees must not be discriminated against on the basis of their race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, pregnancy, sexual orientation or other protected characteristics."
"Lindes Board and management have aligned diversity and inclusion with its business strategies and implemented diversity action planning into business processes, performance management and executive compensation."
See GRI 405-1 for more information.
Community Engagement Complete 550 projects in community engagement Target scope is all reported employee-based Linde community engagement activities.
Linde reported 389 projects in 2021.
Projects are defined as reported by the project team into a Linde database.
"Linde measures the impact of projects, where applicable, on the community beneficiaries, employees and the company."
Analysis shows positive impacts for all three groups.
"For example, teams report that in 91 percent of projects, the quality of life of the beneficiaries is positively impacted; in 78 percent of projects, teams reported that their own management effectiveness improved; in 85 percent of projects, teams reported positive employee engagement."
Results for baseline year 2018 are as reported for legacy Praxair.
"The results for 2021 reflect the continuing pandemic, and teams are judiciously increasing group projects where possible and maintaining a number of virtual events to support the community."
Community engagement projects are directed to address local needs.
Projects focus on four themes: Education & Diversity (29 percent); Health & Wellness (21 percent); Community Support (32 percent); and Environment (18 percent).
See GRI 413-1 for more information.
Community Relations (U.
S.): Community impact assessments in engineering project development at all new sites The Scope is all new U.
S. large capital projects that pass the regular engineering design process and commence construction.
Planning for this target has begun; however the target was halted due ot the pandemic.
Projects are expected to begin in 2022.
The community impact assessment is performed by the business and project execution teams during the planning of new and/or significant expansions of Linde sites.
"It includes a discussion with key stakeholders in the community, which may include representatives from municipalities and community organizations; understanding community needs; and a proposal of potential ways to address these community needs and bring positive impact, especially through social, educational or environmental initiatives."
Global Giving Global Giving: Increase environmental/climate-related philanthropic spend by 50 percent Target scope is Global Giving donations from corporate and global businesses.
"The program contributed $884,000 to environmental- related organizations in 2021, a 59 percent increase from the baseline, achieving the target."
The objective of this target was to direct additional Global Giving funds towards initiatives that will have a positive impact on the environment/climate change and to support Lindes new Climate Change targets.
Linde has long-standing relationships with global environmental non-profit organizations such as The Nature Conservancy and the Arbor Day Foundation.
"Our company also supports regionally-based environmental programs in various countries, including Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Brazil and India."

It is also included in the Proxy Statement for the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in the Corporate Governance and Board Matters section.
"The Proxy Statement also contains a section on Environmental, Social and Governance Highlights."
Lindes Board of Directors consists of 10 Board members.
Eight are independent non-executive directors.
"Lindes CEO serves as an executive director, and the Chairman of the Board was formerly Linde's CEO."
"The Board currently has five standing committees: Audit Committee, Human Capital Committee, Executive Committee, Sustainability Committee and Nomination and Governance Committee."
"Each is comprised of only independent directors, except for the Executive Committee, of which the Chair and CEO are members."
The Board maintains oversight of the company 's values and strategy.
"Each year, it conducts a comprehensive long-term strategic review of the company 's outlook and business plans and provides advice and counsel to management regarding the company 's strategic issues."
"Lindes values are considered integral to its long-term sustainable success, and executive compensation rewards performance in financial and strategic non-financial areas."
"The Boards role in these areas, as well as in risk management, is described in the companys annual Proxy Statement in the Corporate Governance and Board Matters Section, which is available on Lindes website at: https:/ /investors.linde.com/regulatory-filings ."
"The Board has oversight of key aspects of the corporate governance structure in areas of particular interest to the sustainability community, such as director independence; split roles of Chairman and CEO; appropriate board committees; board effectiveness; shareholder outreach and alignment with long-term shareholder interests; mechanisms to avoid conflicts of interest; board diversity; limits to service; industry experience; and a comprehensive sustainability program."
Board members are nominated by the Nomination and Governance Committee for election by the shareholders.
Nominees are elected each year at the Annual General Meeting.
"The Nomination and Governance Committee believes that each director has an established record of accomplishment in areas relevant to our business and objectives, and possesses the characteristics identified in our Corporate Governance Guidelines as essential to a well-functioning and deliberative governing body, including integrity, independence and commitment."
"Each Board member has executive management and director oversight experience in most, if not all, areas that the Board considers critical to the conduct of the companys business, including public policies as they affect global industrial corporations, compliance, corporate governance, productivity management, safety management and sustainable development."
"Governance of Non-Financial Matters Linde has established five core values: safety, inclusion, accountability, integrity and community."
These are the basis of what the company stands for and how it behaves.
A code of ethics has been adopted that provides clear instructions on expected behavior and for reporting concerns about potential non-conformance.
This code has been approved by the Linde Board of Directors and is named the Code of Business Integrity (CBI).
This document is made widely available to employees and third parties and is posted on the companys website.
Governance of Linde 's CBI is described in the Performance section as it relates to an SD 2028 target.
"It is the view of Lindes Board that non-financial issues are a component of the company 's values, culture and performance expectations, and are a basis on which employees drive financial results."
The Board has confirmed the importance of setting non- financial objectives as part of variable compensation to reinforce leaderships focus on maintaining a culture that supports both short- and long-term sustainable results.
"It has established non-financial goals with respect to elements such as safety, environmental responsibility, global compliance, productivity and talent management."
These measures are described in Lindes Proxy Statement.
"Annual payout of executive variable compensation depends on performance in several strategic non-financial areas, including best- in-class performance in safety, environmental responsibility, global compliance, productivity and talent management."
"Lindes Board monitors the implementation of its CBI, which includes commitments to adhere to high standards for diversity and inclusion; safety; health; care for the environment and quality; human rights; corporate citizenship; and the prevention of bribery and corruption."
The Audit Committee oversees the company 's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
"The Human Capital Committee oversees diversity and inclusion policies, objectives and programs to achieve those objectives."
The Nomination and Governance Committee periodically reviews the companys guidelines and policies governing its response to important broad public policy issues in the areas of corporate social responsibility and corporate citizenship.
"Alignment with Compensation Coupled with its assessment of performance related to financial goals, the Human Capital Committee reviewed the strategic actions taken by management that focused on long term sustainable success."
"After the end of the year, management presented to the Human Capital Committee the degree of achievement in meeting each goal, and for each element, provided its view of the relative degree of importance to long term success."
"Based on the results, the Human Capital Committee determined that the Companys performance with respect to the strategic and non-financial goals was favorable and set the Corporate strategic and non-financial payout factor at 140% of target variable compensation (relative to a 200% maximum)."
The table on the next page illustrates the basis for which 2021 variable compensation payouts.
"In January 2022, the Human Capital Committee approved the design and goals for the Companys annual performance-based variable compensation program in 2022."
"In recognition of the importance of the Companys standards for, and impacts from, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations, the non-financial component will now be comprised of three pillars, each with their own weights."

"TCFD notes impacts to ecosystems, human health and businesses; see https:/ /www.fsb-tcfd.org/about/ ."
Potential Impact on Linde The potential impact of this risk is both short- and long-term.
Lindes most recent risk assessment notes that such events could disrupt or delay Lindes ability to produce and distribute its products to customers and could potentially expose Linde to third-party liability claims.
"In addition, such events could impact Lindes customers and suppliers, resulting in temporary or long- term outages and/or the limitation of supply of energy and other raw materials used in normal business operations."
"Steps Undertaken Linde evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, consults with vendors, insurance providers and industry experts, makes investments in suitably resilient design and technology, and conducts regular reviews of the business risks with management."

See 405 -1.
203-1 Development and impact of infrastructure investments and services supported A significant portion of the company's applications support the development of social and economic infrastructures.
Linde gases help to enable safe drinking water for more tha n 225 million people each day .
Industrial and specialty gases enable cleaner and more efficient economic growth in industries from cement to steel.
"Linde applications are also integral to the development of future energy infrastructures (e.g., applications for renewable energy and secon d-generation biofuels)."
The company is committed to improving the quality of life in the communities it serves.
"Through financial contributions and the volunteer efforts of employees, Linde supports programs that address diversity, education, the environment and community resilience all important aspects of community sustainability."
"In 2021, the company s Global Giving P rogram contributed $ 9.7 million to a range of programs and charitable organizations around the world."
See 201 -1 for information on how the Global Giving contribution was distributed by focus area and business region.
"Employee and facility/business contributions from community engagement projects were estimated at more than $2.4 million, and the dollar value of employee and facility in -kind contributions, such as food, clothing and supplies, was estimated at more than $400,000."
Global Giving also tracked more than $ 1.7 million in in -kind contributions of Linde product s such as gases.
"The total Linde contribution, including in -kind contributions , but not volunteer time, is estimated at approximately $14.2 million."
"The estimated value of volunteer time is more than $800,000 ."
203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts Linde's business helps countries modernize with technologies that enable environmentally responsible economic growth.
"Linde provides careers and associated benefits to more than 72 ,000 employees, many of whom are hired locally, as well as benefits to thousands of retirees."
"Indirect benefits accrue to Linde s vendors (also, often, contracted locally), as well as customers, shareholders and communities in which the company operates."
"For descriptions of how Linde's business model enables indirect economic, social and environmental benefits, see pages 8 and 9."
The company hires local talent: Most emerging economy business leaders are host country or regional nationals.
It sources local contractors.
"Substantially all contract drivers, and most contract construction workers, are sourced locally ."
It helps build capacity in local communities.
"Linde employee volunteers provided a range of benefits to approximately 250,000 people, mostly in communities local to Linde sites."
"All Linde community engagement projects are encouraged to help meet specific needs identified by community leaders, but there is no science to measure the impact of community outreach."
"Linde uses a methodology developed by the London Benchmarking Group (LBG) Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 51 203-2 to evaluate the indirect economic, environmental and social impacts of its community engagement activity for the company, its employees and beneficiaries (see 413 -1 and 413 -2)."
"In 2021, for 91 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement had a direct positive impact on recipients' quality of lif e."
"In approximately 71 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement provided the beneficiaries with value that could lead to economic benefits, such as job skills or opportunities for personal growth."
"Community engagement is a component of Linde's SD 20 28 goals, with the target to deliver 550 projects per year in communities by 2028 t hrough Linde community engagement initiatives ."
"In 202 1, despite the ongoing pandemic, Linde employees delivered almost 390 such projects, a substantial portion of the 202 1 goal, prioritizing support for the pandemic, remote education opportunities and virtual engagement."
M any of the projects directed towards education support Linde's contribution to SDG Target 8 to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men.
"The significance of Linde's economic and governance PFs and targets in the context of external benchmarks and stakeholder priorities is explained in the section Materiality, Priorities and Targets: SD 2028 , page 15."
204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers Note: This section responds to 204 -1 and also responds to 102 -9.
Policy Linde s Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code) is made available on its website at: https://www.linde.com/about -linde/global- procurement .
"Suppliers, contractors and third parties play a c ritical role in Linde s ability to operate and provide products and services to its customers."
Suppliers' actions and practices also reflect on Linde.
"Therefore, the company chooses suppliers carefully based on merit and a due dili gence process."
Linde expects suppliers to comply with legal requirements and to act in a manner that is consistent with Linde s values and the principles outlined in its Supplier Code and CBI.
"The Supplier Code defines Linde s basic requirements for its suppliers concerning their responsibilities towards Linde and its stakeholders, societies and the environment."
"As part of the standard documentation for all new and renewing contracts, suppliers must comply with the principles outlined in the Supplier Code and with Linde s CBI or equivalent policies of their own."
"Specific expectations are laid out for Integrity and Legal Compliance; Human Rights and Labor Standards; Health, Safety and Environment; Accuracy of Books and Records; Intellectual Property; a nd Supply Chain."
A grievance mechanism is provided.
Local Sourcing Linde works with suppliers in many countries in which it does business approximately 100 countries.
Linde has a corporate value of community.
This reflects the nature of Linde's industri al gas products: it is generally not economical to transport them distances greater than a few hundred miles from the production facility.
"As a result, the company invests in building local facilities and hires locally for management, employees and contrac tors."
The most significant sets of suppliers from the point of view of local talent sourcing are facility construction contractors and contract drivers.
"Installation of new equipment, as well as ongoing maintenance, is largely performed by local suppliers ."
Linde uses locally -sourced contract drivers in most of its Asia Pacific countries; in EMEA (except for Germany and the UK); in South America; and in parts of Central America.
102- 9 The company invests in supplier capacity -building to raise performance standards and share benefits at the same time.
The company also values opportunities to engage suppliers and team members to better understand product offerings and applications.
"Past examples of supplier collaboration include the Supplier Innovation Fair at the Linde Technology Center, where suppliers discussed technology topics with Linde t eam members."
"As part of overall efforts to lower CO2 emissions, Procurement teams often work wit h distribution management and other team members on efforts to reduce fleet emissions, such as procuring renewable fuels."
See page 19.
"Promoting Supplier Diversity Providing innovative and valuable solutions for customers around the globe requires diverse talents, perspectives and experiences."
"As part of this, Linde supports programs that assist it in fostering relationships with a variety of qualified, diverse businesses for its sup ply chain around the globe."
"52 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report 204- 1, 102- 9 Linde's Supplier Diversity Program in the U."
S. encourages and supports the use of a variety of qualified distinct business enterprises.
It seeks to provide maximum practical opportunities for diverse businesses to participate in the supply of goods and/or services that support the company's business model.
The program has championed companies classified as small and diverse businesses for nearly two decades.
The vice president an d controller serves as the small business liaison officer and oversees the Small Busin ess Subcontracting Program.
"On an annual basis, in collaboration with management and support staff from the company s Procurement t eam, a detailed small business subcontracting plan is established with practical goals that the company strives to achieve wi th small businesses in procuring designated commodities."
"In 202 1, the company spent a total of $546 million with small and diverse bu siness enterprises."
Approximately $429 million was procured from U.
"S. small businesses, representing products and services that covered approximately 800 different commodities and services."
"Some companies that identified as small also identified as a veteran -owned or service -disabled- veteran -owned businesses, corresponding to nearly 6 percent of total small business spend, or $ 33.3 million."
"Approximately $66 million was spent with women -owned businesses, double the spending from 2020 ."
"Additionally, $31 million was spent with minority -owned businesses, including businesses identifying as ethn ic minorities or non -ethnic minorities, such as LGBT or persons with disabilities."
The company's U.
S. Procurement team has collaborated with its global affiliates to understand the supplier diversity landscape and opportunities in each country in w hich it operates.
"By leveraging the knowledge and skills of the company's div erse employee population and continuing to provide cultural awareness training around the world, the company strives to achieve an organically inclusive environment where diversity is recognized as a valuable asset and competitive advantage in its supply c hain."
"Globally, the company continues to identify and enhance supplier diversity initiatives in areas with emerging programs and/or the potential to develop them."
"In 2021, the company renewed its membership with the Regional Councils of Minority Supplier Development Council (MSDC), Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, NY Chapter (NGLCC -NY) and National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)."
"Linde continues to promote internal program s for diverse suppliers seeking sales opportunities, including, but not limited to, service geography, description of business capabilities and acquired certifications."
"Coupled with the company's existing busi ness matchmaker program, the advanced business info rmation has continued to provide opportunities for the company's procurement team and operations personnel to more efficiently identify experienced candidates for requests for proposals, leading to a higher percentage of diverse suppliers o ffering proposals and ultimately being awarded contracts."
Outreach and capacity -building with the company's prime supplier population allowed for the sharing of best practices in supplier diversity and yielded a commitment to enhance or establish mutually beneficial diversity metrics from suppliers with whom the company spends $1 million or more with annually.
"In 2021, the company continued its Tier 2 diverse spend reporting program with U."
"S. prime suppliers, demonstrating the company's long- term commitment of sustaining diversity and inclusion in its supply chain."
"The program's goal is to develop diverse suppliers, beyond the com pany's direct supplier relationships, by providing additional economic growth opportunities."
"Over the course of the year, the program identified $ 18.2 million in combined direct and indirect diverse spend."
"Sixteen prime suppliers from various industry sectors, including telecom, logistics, health care and MRO, participated in the program."
Capturing this information has allowed the tea m to advance its supplier diversity program for validating and tracking the company s spend with diverse businesses and has helped to identify collaboration opportunities for 2021 with companies that have esta blished supplier diversity programs .
Efforts a re also active outside of the U.
"S. For example, in South Africa, Afrox has achieved Level 1 on the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) score card for the third year in a row."
"The BBBEE program is meant to improve diversity in the workplace , implement skills development, CSR programs and providing business opportunities to the previously disadvantaged black -owned business."
Investing in Supplier Relationships: A Win- Win Linde works hard to deepen relationships with suppliers and contractors while ensuring that they meet its standards and business values.
This brings multiple benefits to the company and to the communities near to its operations.
Linde puts a high priority on evaluating risk s associated with its supply chain and col laborates with suppliers and other stakeholders where its involvement can make the most impact.
"On a regular basis, Linde works with its carriers on safety training, initiatives and sharing best practices to continuously improve upon operational efficienc y, reduce environmental hazards and promote security and human rights."
"Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 53 204- 1, 102- 9 Linde also works cooperatively with selected key suppliers in efforts to better understand and calculate its Scope 3 inventor y."
See pages 68 -70.
Linde has improved its efforts to calculate Scope 3 emissions for a broad range of its supplies based on an enhanced methodology that c onsiders geographic origin as well as economic sector.
"Through direct engagement and capacity building, Linde has been successful i n advancing supplier awareness of environmental and climate change topics and continues to improve the data accuracy of its Scope 3 emissions accounting ."
Such engagements can unearth win -win approaches to reduce resources and provide social and environmental benefits throughout the supply chain.
"Safety Training Worldwide contractor safety training: One hundred percent of contract drivers, and most contract construction workers, are hired from local firms."
"In addition to the jobs provided to locally based construction workers and drivers, in 2021, Linde invested more than 2 million hours in safety training to contractors in several categories ."
"This included training for more than 30,000 contractors."
"Contractor training averaged more than 50 hours a year, more than a work week."
"If each contractor hour costs Linde $20, this investment can be estimated at more than $ 40 million."
"In all cases, this train ing is directed towards achieving safer construction of Linde facilities and safer, more secure and more fuel- efficient transportation of Linde products."
Linde s world -class results for contractor and driver sa fety are a measurable consequence of this investment .
See 403 -9.
"In addition, the safety and other professional driver training results in a transfer of professional skills that increases the employability of the recipient For information on supplier and contractor training, see 414 -2."
205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption Linde administers an annual risk assessment that is circulated to all business managers globally and functional leaders and covers 100 percent of all business units.
Potential risks related to corruption are an explicit focus.
A Compliance Review Board ( CRB) performs quarterly regulatory risk assessments.
Dedicated Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and anti -bribery audits are also conducted.
"In the last 12 years, 40 audits have been conducted, which is more than three audits per year on average."
Linde operates in certain jurisdictions identified as high risk based on the Corruption Perception Index from Transparency Internat ional.
The company has not identified significant risks other than regular risks that are dealt with through training and certific ations of employees.
"205-2 Communication and training on anti -corruption policies and procedures In 2021, Lindes Board of Directors received training on the CBI, which includes anti-corruption policies and procedures."
The company also trains all its salaried employees globally on anti -corruption.
The company has an established process to conduct thorough due diligence prior to contracting and sends training to 100 percent of all third parties and agents who interact with the government on the company s behalf.
"Linde s CBI applies to the company's directors and employees, including its CEO, CFO and the vice president and controller ."
"This CBI, which includes elements of c ompliance with l aws, business integrity and ethics, has been approved by the Linde Board of Directors."
"To assist employees and directors in complying with this code of ethics , management periodically develops specific standards implementing certain provisions of the code."
Linde's CBI is posted on Linde's website.
"One hundred percent of salaried Linde manage ment and employees, and some non -exempt employees, are required to annually certify that they have read and understand the company s CBI, which includes a rigorous outline of the FCPA and anti -bribery laws ."
This is an online training and survey.
"Training t o targeted populations was conducted in 202 1; the company achieved 99.1 percent , based upon the figures verifiable through Linde s Learning Management System ."
The remain der of the targeted population whose training could not be verified will have completed training in 2022.
54 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken Linde takes its commitment to integrity very seriously .
"Non -compliance with the CBI, depending on the circumstances, can result in serious disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment."
"Employees are actively encouraged to report suspected complaints and concerns and are expected to report violations through a number of channels, including the Integrity Hotline."
Reports through the Integrity Hotline may be made anonymously.
It is a violation of company policy for any person to retaliate against any individual who has reported an y matter in good faith.
Table SOC (1 2) provides the aggregate number of hotline reports and a summary of the types of reports received; see 406 -1.
"All hotline reports are promptly handled, and identified issues are addressed."
Further details are not provided in Linde 's public reporting as they are business confidential.
No confirmed incidents of violation of anti -corruption laws occurred in 2021 .
"206-1 Legal actions for anti -competitive behavior, anti- trust, and monopoly practices and their outcomes No anti -trust regulatory or enforcement action was initiated in 202 1."
"Also refer to the ""Contingent Liabilities"" section of Linde's annual 10- K filing ."
"Connecting with External Stakeholders to Expand and Refine Scope 3 Reporting Linde has reported emissions along its supply chain, or Scope 3 emissions, for several years."
"This category of GHG is of interest to many stakeholders, as the world seeks to understand the global carbon footprint, and the company discloses this information in annual reporting, including its CDP Climate Change response."
"Scope 3 emissions derive from suppliers, direct customers, or even end consumers, and developing baselines and sound and repeatable methodologies is an essential step in reporting."
"Collaboration with suppliers and customers is key to obtaining the information to make this process successful, to increase accuracy, and to establish baselines that can be used to manage and potentially reduce emissions long-term."
Such special projects also offer the company the opportunity to engage with another group of external stakeholders: future sustainability champions.
Lindes continued work in Scope 3 seemed a perfect fit for the continuing engagement with Villanova Universitys Resilient Innovation through Sustainable Engineering (RISE) program.
"Since 2016, the company has been a member of RISE, completing one or two sustainability projects annually with graduate students who take part in the RISE program."
"The advantages for both sides are apparent, said Kathy Kuberka, Director, Technology Planning, Linde benefits from the graduate students' fresh ideas and solutions based on the current state of science, driving resilient innovation across our value chain."
The university agrees.
"Our collaboration with Linde enables graduate student teams the unique opportunity to work alongside professional experts and to complement their academic knowledge with practical experience addressing real-life sustainability challenges, said Dr. Mary McRae, RISE faculty advisor."
"RISE team members Adi Pise, Ana Cedillo, Chris Wilson, Jamie Silk and Renee Turner helped to research emissions from cylinder and tank assets in the semester-long effort, which involved outreach with key suppliers who agreed to collaborate in this endeavor."
"To close the project, the students made a final presentation and gave recommendations on how to streamline the data collection process while continuing to focus on data quality."
"Interestingly, the team found that calculated emissions from supplier data were lower than the original model suggested, due to a high proportion of aluminum produced from hydropower sources, making clear the value from engagements across the supply chain for such efforts."
The next project is already in planning.
"The Linde team looks for more opportunities to work creatively with suppliers, customers and academia on complex projects."
"For more information on Lindes GHG inventory, see Lindes CDP disclosures on the Sustainable Development Reporting Center ."

Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 59 Introduction Linde is a resource- intensive company.
Linde s environmental performance year -on-year can best be evaluated on an intensity basis versus revenue.
"In most cases, this shows a positive trend."
"In addition, Linde s business model is resource efficiency to make more value than it consumes."
"The environmental and other benefits of Linde applications are described in the ""Business Model"" s ection on page 10 , the ""Creating Economic, Environmental and Social Value"" section on page 11 , and the ""Linde Applications Enable >2x Carbon Productivity"" section on page 20 ."
"For ease of comparison and to follow Linde s performance year -on-year, Linde presents a full- year pro forma value for 2018 for each environmental KPI."
"These 2018 pro forma values are comparable to the 2019 and 2020 numbers, using the same reporting scope, definition and boundaries."
"Trend data needs to be understood in the context of t he merger in 2018 between Linde AG and Praxair , Inc. to form Linde plc ."
Linde s reporting boundaries for eKPIs are consistent with the financial reporting boundaries and financial control definition to t he greatest extent possible.
"Linde reports on all eKPIs for all subsidiaries, JVs and other holdings within its organizational boundaries whose revenues and Earnings Befor e Interests and Taxes (EBIT) are included in Linde s financial results."
Linde does not collect eKPI data for minority holdings and other holdings that are not reporting their financials.
"EKPIs for JVs, which are not fully consolidated into the company financials (at -equity JVs), are collected but are only included in external GHG reporting under Scope 3."
301-1 Materials used by weight or volume Raw materials are procured through a global procurement organization under global procurement standards and expectations that include requirements for material sustainability.
Linde has supplier expectations that manage sustainability in its supply chain.
"Non-Renewable Materials Used Linde estimates that 1 percent by weight of the raw materials used in 2021 were non -renewable, including natural gas and naphtha, which are used in hydrogen production."
Linde also builds air separation units (ASUs) and steam methane reformers (SMRs).
"Con struction materials for these are generally from non -renewable sources: aluminum, carbon steel, stainless steel, copper and brass alloys, brass and metals."
The largest material by spend is steel.
"Renewable Materials Used Ninety -nine percent by weight of the raw materials used in 2021 to produce gaseous nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and hydrogen were renewable raw materials."
"Renewable raw materials used by Linde include air, water, carbon dioxide and hydrogen."
These product s represent more than 90 percent of the revenue Linde received for the products it manufactures.
"Examples of products not included are those manufactu red by Surface Technologies and low -volume products, such as acetylene."
"Using air as its raw material, Linde produces oxygen, ni trogen, argon and rare gases through several air separation processes, of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent."
"As air is a renewable natural resource, there is no negative environmental consequence to u sing this raw material."
"Process gases, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, specialty gases and acetylene, are produced by methods other than air separation."
"In many cases, these are sourced as an industrial byproduct or waste."
"Some of these byproduct sour ces are renewable, but all offer a means to reuse products that would otherwise have been waste."
The volumes of process gases procured are considered business confidential.
"Most carbon dioxide is purchased from byproduct sources, including chemical plant s, refineries and industrial processes."
"These byproduct sources include ethanol manufacturing facilities, where the waste carbon dioxide is considered renewable."
A portion is recovered from carbon dioxide wells.
Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are produced by either steam methane reforming of natural gas or by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries.
"In 2021, Linde procured 19 percent byproduct hydrogen ."
Helium is acquired from several sources.
In the U.
"S., for example, Linde is sourced from helium -rich natural gas stream s."
Acetylene can be produced from calcium carbide and water.
A significant percentage is purchased as a chemical byproduct.
60 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report 301-2 Percentage of materials used that are recycled input materials Also see 301 -1 for information on renewable raw materials.
"As part of its sustainable supply chain program, Linde s Procurement organization works with vendors to reduce consumption of upstream, non -renewable natural resources."
"For some of its business lines, Linde actively sources recycled input materials by using byproducts fr om other industrial processes."
The total weight of these byproducts as a percentage of total material use is not reported here.
"From 2011 2021, most of the acetylene produced by Linde in the U."
"S. was sourced from byproduct acetylene, avoiding the mining o f calcium carbonate and the recycling or disposal of carbide lime."
Most Linde carbon dioxide sold in the U.
S. was sourced from ethanol fermentati on (a biomass source).
"As a business, Linde is constantly researching innovative ways to expand the use of this application."
Most gases are transported in pipelines or trucks and use little packaging.
Cylinder products are typically transported by truck.
(See 301-3).
"Linde has a large engineering business, which designs and constructs new production plants."
"When building a new plant, the focus is put on the re- use of parts/components from other dissembled plants (e.g., refurbished parts) as much as possible."
"At the end- of-life of a production facility, parts and components are checked, refurbished if required, and directly re- used or put in stock for future usage."
"Thus, most of the materials are recycled and become input materials (e.g., for new plants)."
"In order to avoid procurement of new materials, the company has established several asset management programs t hat are actively identifying idle assets (e.g., cylinders) to ensure that they are put back into use rather than purchasing new materials."
"The programs actively track all assets, are well reported and yielding good results."
301-3 Reclaimed products and their packaging materials Linde produces very little packaging waste.
"Linde delivers most of its product in pipelines or bulk trucks, or in cylinder s."
"As the products are consumable, there is nothing to reclaim and no packaging material for the majority of products."
"For the packaged gases product lines, either disposable cylinders or reusable cylinders are utilized."
"The metal cylinders last about 40 years, are returnable and are typically reused multiple times."
Linde runs several large cylinder refurbishment centers worldwide as well as many smaller test shops and repair centers in many countries.
"In its cylinder test shop in Wolverhampton, UK, Linde refurbishes about 500,000 cylinders per year in order to avoid unnecessary scrapping."
"302-1 Energy consumption within the organization Where MWh were converted to GJ, MWh were multiplied by 3.6."
"Fuel Consumption Linde s total non -renewable fuel consumption in 2021 was 75.6 million GJ, or 21 million MWh."
This figure represents energy consumption and excludes fuel consumed as a feedstock for production.
Linde did not consume any renewable fuel for such purposes in 2021.
"Fuel types used included natural gas, diesel, oil and ""other,"" which includes naphtha and other refinery fuel gas."
"Electricity Consumed Total non -renewable electricity consumed in 2021 was approximately 40 million MWh, or 144 million GJ."
"Total active renewable electricity purchased in 2021 was 2.8 million MWh, or 10 million GJ."
"Linde also tracks low carbon electricity, which includes bot h active and passive renewable electricity as well as nuclear."
"Active renewable electricity is classified as electricity procured through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), directly connected 100 percent RE supplier contr acts, or validated green energy cert ificates."
"Passively procured electricity from the grid was calculated using the latest location -based renewable energy grid factors from the IEA and, where available, plant -specific RE factors according to the supplier contract/utility bill."
"In 2021, activ e RE was 2.780 million MWh and passive RE was 9.125 million MWh, for a total of 11.905 million MWh."
"Nuclear was 5.051 million renew able electricity, of which 0.7 million was actively sourced , bringing the total to 17 million MWh of low carbon electricity, which represents 40 percent of Linde s total electricity consumption in 2021."
"Electricity values for the 2018 baseline, 2019, and 2020 have been updated due to the Scope 2 recalculation incorporating additional market -based emission factors."

"When planning new sites, processes are in place to ensure that Linde minimizes any potential negative impacts on biodiversity ."
"Linde follows internatio nally recognized guidelines when performing its evaluations, such as the Voluntary Guidelines on Biodiversity -Inclusive Impact Assessment issued by the United Nations."
Linde s approach is to avoid operations near protected areas.
"In fact, because most of Linde s sites are located in industrial areas or business parks, protected areas are not typically within close proximity to the facilities."
"If periodic surveillance finds site(s) within close proximity of a protected area, Linde will work to understand possible impacts and to minimize, restore, and/or offset, as appropriate, working with local stakeholders."
"Because sites recognized as important to biodiversity may change over time, Linde periodically conducts a surveillance of the locations of i ts global industrial gas production facilities and their proximity to protected areas, based on data provided by the International Unio n for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)."
This surveillance is conducted at least every 3 years.
"The last evaluation , covering more than 600 production sites , established that none of these sites are located in the vicinity of a protected area."

"66 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report Greenhouse Gas Emissions 305-1, 305 -2, 305 -3, 305 -4, 305 -5 GHG Inventory Methodology Linde s greenhouse gas ( GHG) emissions disclosures have been prepared based on a reporting year of January 1 to December 31, the same as the financial reporting period."
"All GHG emissions figures are in metric tons of CO2e and cover six gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, PFCs, HFCs, NF3 and SF6."
"Linde's GHG emissions information was prepared with reference to the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sus tainable Development's Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, revised edition (the GHG Protocol)."
Global warming potentials (GWPs) are sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Repo rt.
Timelines and Base Year GHG Emissions Linde reports on its eKPIs for the last four years in order to reflect the trend and development of KPIs.
"Linde defined new sustainable development targets in 2019, which set 2018 as a baseline year for the new company s targets."
Those targets include targets relating to GHG emissions .
The basis for those targets is a 2018 full- year pro forma value for the complete merged company according to the final organizational structure.
"For performance against GHG targets, see the ""Performance Towards Targets"" s ection , page 24 ."
"Excluded Sourc es of GHG Emissions Linde has very small office sites and smaller sales outlets (such as retail outlets) with fewer than five people, called de-minimis sites."
Emissions from these sites are negligible and are therefore not included in the GHG inventory.
Prior Year Revisions The company has restated 2018 -2020 Scope 2 to reflect an update to market -based emission factors.
See 102 -48 on page 13 .
External Verification Linde s 202 1 GHG inventory was verified by a third party.
"In 202 2, a Limited Assurance was performed on Scopes 1 and 2 and a subset of Scope 3 emissions (202 1 calendar year data)."
A copy of Linde's assurance statement is available at the end of this report and may be found separately on the Linde website.
"305-1 Direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1) Linde s total Scope 1 emissions in 2021 were 16,321,000 MT CO2e, which is an increase of 0.5 percent from 2020."
This is mainly attributed to increases in production volumes that were largely offset by efficiency improvements.
"The primary source of Scope 1 emissions for Linde is the combustion of natural gas at hydrogen plants, which represented 11.4 million metric tons of Scope 1 emissions in 2021."
"Another portion is from ASU plants using natural gas for energy generation, which amounted to 2.2 million metric tons CO2e."
"Smaller sources of Scope 1 emissions are other GHGs (e.g., from methane plants or nitrous oxide plants) or other types of GHG emissions that are converted into CO2 equivalents."
The total of such other GHG emissions was 0.9 million metric tons in 2021.
Carbon dioxide and other plants caused approximately 1.2 million metric tons.
The combus tion of diesel and gasoline from transport activities resulted in approximately 0.6 million metric tons CO2e in 2021.
"Scope 1 Emissions Covered by Emissions -limiting Regulations In 2021, 1,570,000 metric tons of Scope 1 emissions (10 percent) were subject to a form of carbon legislation, over a cap- and-trade scheme, ETS or a form of carbon taxation."
Most of this number (more than 86 percent) was covered by the EU ETS or UK ETS schemes ; sma ller amounts were subject to sub-national regulations such as the California CAT scheme or the Singapore carbon tax.
"For details on the 2021 carbon regulation schemes applicable to Linde, see Lindes most recent CDP report, which will be available at the end of July at : https://www.linde.com/ -/media/linde/merger/documents/sustainable- development/2022 -cdp-response -climate- change.pdf ."
"Calculation Methodology Hydrogen plants, which represent the largest source of Linde s Scope 1 emissions, consume natural gas, both for fuel and feedstock."
"To determine Scope 1 emissions, the amount of carbon produced as product is subtracted."
"In addition, Linde calculates Scope 1 emissions fr om gas losses (during production and filling processes)."
"These are calculated for nitrous oxide manufacturi ng and filling facilities, carbon dioxide plants, on -site refrigeration equipment and cylinder filling operations associated with methane (CH4), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)."
"Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 67 305-1 To calculate Scope 1 emissions from natural gas, Linde uses the reported natural gas factors from each production plant (depending on the mix of hydrocarbons)."
"If a specific natural gas factor is not available or known, Linde uses a chemical natur al gas to CO2 conversion factor from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), from the Government of United Kingdom."
"For other fuels, Linde uses DEFRA facto rs to convert to CO2 equivalents."

7 percent increase from 20 20.
"The largest electricity user is ASUs, which account for approximately 90 percent of all electricity used."
These emissions were calculated using the market -based approach.
Linde continues to move to market -based emissions factors where possible.
"In some cases, market -based factors are higher than location -based factors."
These have resulted in increases in Scope 2 emissions.
"Compared to 2020, Scope 2 emissions have increase d, partly due in i ncreased production."
Restatements are made in accordance with its GHG Recalculation policy .
"Linde has updat ed its Scope 2 emissions for 2018, 2019 and 2020."
"Linde also calculated Scope 2 emissions for 202 1 using the location -based approach, which applies IEA factors and eGRID emission factors in the U."
S.
Scope 2 emissions calculated with the location -based approach were 21.4 million metric tons CO 2e in 202 1.
The difference between market -based and location -based emissions are mostly due to certain plants where customers provide the electricity to Linde (which Linde purchases).
So me of these plants have a very high market -based emissions factor compared to the location -based emissions factor.
Organizational Boundary Linde reports on all electricity and its resulting Scope 2 emissions purchased by the company.
"Electricity for sites where Li nde does not pay the utility bill is excluded from its reported electricity number as well as from the reported Scope 2; however, i t is tracked internally for operational purposes and for Scope 3 reporting."
"Calculation Methodology The main methodology for calculating Scope 2 emissions from electricity is the market -based approach, using site- specific emissions factors by plant accor ding to supplier contracts and utility bills where available."
"For sites where such market -based factors are not known, Linde uses the most recent location -based factors from the IEA and the EPA s eGRID factors for the U."

Relevance or materiality to Linde s footprint: This includes activity that may have a potentially significant GHG consequence.
Upstream Scope 3 Emissions Linde s methodologies for upstream Scope 3 emi ssions are described below.
"Fuel- and energy -related activities not included in Scopes 1 or 2 (category 3) Scope 3 emissions from fuel -and energy -related activities (including upstream emissions from purchased fuel, purchased electricity and transmission and distribution losses) are a significant source of Scope 3 emissions for Linde, as Linde's business is energy -intensive, and energy is a significant cost for Linde."
"The methodology used is based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accoun ting and Reporting Standard, Category 3 for Scope 3 emissions caused in the extraction, production and transportation of fuels and energy purchased by Linde."
"For electricity, Linde applies IEA factors for transmission and distribution (T&D) losses and DEFRA factors for Well -to-Tank (WTT) to calculate all the Scope 3 GHG emissions released into the atmosphere from the production, processing and delivery of energy."
The calculation is done on a site level for each site for which Linde purchases the power.
"For thermal energy, a global WTT factor for heat and steam from DEFRA is applied."
"For Scope 3 emissions from transport fuels as well as other fuels consumed (excluding feedstocks), DEFRA factors for fuel- and energy -related emissions are used per relevant category."
In 2021 DEFRA adjusted its methodology and underlying assumptions to calculate its Scope 3 emissions factors for fuel and energy.
"This led to a significant increase of the Scope 3 factors relevant for Linde, resulting in an increase in Linde's Scope 3 emissions in this category by more than 2 million tons CO2e."
A small portion of the increase in 2021 is also based on higher fuel and electricity consumption due to in creased production/output.
"Purchased Goods and Services (category 1) In 2021, Linde defined a new company -wide methodology to calculate its Scope 3 category 1 emissions, as well as expanded its boundaries, leading to a substantial increase of its reported emiss ions in this category (by 2.6 million tons CO2e)."
Linde's Scope 3 category 1 now considers Scope 3 emissions from Linde's purchased raw materials representing >95 percent of Linde's procurement spend in this category.
"This includes raw materials and tr aded items like healthcare components or hardgoods sold in Linde's shops, construction components used by Linde engineering to build customer plants, as well as purchased feedstock natural gas for hydrogen plants and compressed air for air separation pl ants."
"The calculation of carbon emissions from Linde's raw materials procured (except for natural gas and compressed air feedstock) is now based upon a model utilizing input -output tables and data from OECD, EXIOBASE, the U."
S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and World Bank.
CO2e emissions are calculated based on GWP values from IPCC s AR 5 (2013) for a 100 -year time horizon including carbon feedbacks.
"To calculate S cope 3 from natural gas feedstock Linde applies a fuel -based method based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, Category 3 for Scope 3 emissions caused in the extraction, production, and transportation of fuels a nd energy."
"Linde uses emission factors from DEFRA, which have increased considerably in 2021 and have impacted Linde's Scope 3 category 1 value."
"305-3 Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 69 For compressed air, Linde receives information from the supplier about the specific energy usage to provide that feedstock an d calculates the resulting Scope 3 emissions based on the energy consumption and the supplier -plant -specific electricity Scope 2 emission factors."
"Capital Goods (category 2) In 2021, Linde applied a new company -wide methodology to calculate its Scope 3 category 2 emissions, which considers capital goods procured by Linde allocated to a procurement category, such as cylinders, tanks, healthcare, automotive or plant components capitalized, as well as production plants operated by Linde."
"The calculation of carbon emissions from Linde's capital goods procured is based upon a model utilizing input -output tables and data from OECD, EXIOBASE, the U."
S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and World Bank.
(See category 1).
"Moreover, in 2021 Linde began collecting product -specific GHG emissions data from several suppliers of cylinder assets procured in 2021."
The product carbon footprint included the suppliers' own emissions (based on a product -specific calculation) as well as related upstream emissions.
The emissions data obtained directly from suppliers were integrated into the overall category 2 value.
The Scope 3 category 2 value decreased in 2021 compared to the previous year.
This is due to a reclassification of some procuremen t categories that were previously considered as capital goods that are now correctly dis closed under raw materials.
"Upstream Transportation and Distribution , including Contractor Driving (category 4) This category includes emissions related to Linde's inbound and outbound logistics that are paid by Linde and are carried out by external carri ers."
Linde uses a distance- based method for calculating Scope 3 emissions from outbound deliveries of gases to its clients .
Contractor miles driven are collected in each country and business or region and tracked.
"Linde s Scope 3 emissions resulting from delivery of products by third- party carriers were derived using the same methodology as used to calculate GHG emissions from owned trucks: Emissions from transport are calculated based on actual kilometers driven for commercial and non -commercial vehicles, multiplied by average emissions factors by vehicle type from the Estimated U."

"In addition, in 2021 Linde implemented a new tool to calculate emi ssions from products and services procured, which uses a spend -based method (see category 1)."
This also considers transport services procured.
"The calculation result showed that emissions from transport of construction components delivered to Linde Engineering construction sites (mostly over sea and air) are relevant and therefore are to be included in the overall Scope 3 category 4 value, leading to an overall increase of emissions in category 4."
"Emissions from contractor driving were previously classifi ed as downstream emissions (category 9) and have been reclassified, per guidance in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol."
"See the Restatements section, 102 -48. Business Travel (category 6) Linde also estimates a small amount of emissions from business travel, estimated at 0.021 million MT."
"This has not previously been reported as a part of this disclosure , as it is negligible."
"As we have determined an estimate, we now include within our Scop e 3 disclosures."
"Estimates are based on the company s historical ai r travel records , including countr ies of destination , and uses emission s data provided by airlines ."
Downstream Scope 3 Emissions Linde s methodologies for downstream Scope 3 emissions are described below.
"Downstream Leased Assets (category 13) This category includes emissions for assets such as smaller on -site facilities where the customer is paying for the power and, in many cases, operating the plant."
This also includes several major plants where customers are paying for the power and where Linde is charging a facility fee to the cust omer.
Emissions for those plants where the customer pays for the power are not included in Linde s Scope 2.
"HyCO plants/facilities that are owned by Linde are fully reported under Scope 1, regardless of whether they are leased out or independent on who i s running the plant or providing the fuel or feedstock."
"305-3 70 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report Emissions from leased out or charged out entities are calculated on a plant level, using the same calculation methodology as for calculating indirect/ Scope 2 emissions for other Linde plants."
"For plants where the customer pays for the power and the plant -specific emissions factors are not known, Linde uses c ountry emission factors from the IEA to calculate indirect emissions for those sites."
Emissions due to Investments (category 15) Linde includes in its Scope 1 and 2 reporting only subsidiaries/holdings that are reporting their financials to the company a nd whose results are consolidated into the company P&L.
Holdings/investments that are reporting their results but are not consolidated into the P& L statement (mainly JVs consolidated at -equity) are not considered for Scope 1 and 2 emissions but are reported as Scope 3 from investments.
"Linde has large JV operations, especially in China."
Linde calculates its emissions due to investments on a plant level.
All JVs are reporting their electricity and other fuel co nsumption into Linde's environmental reporting s ystem.
"Linde is then calculating Scope 3 from such investments for all plants in this category, by adding reported direct emissions from HyCO plants and indirect emissions from ASUs and other plants, based on reported electricity consumption, mult iplied by a country IEA factor."
"Emissions in this category increased , in part, in 2021 due to the change in ownership of the company s business in Taiwan."
"As of 2021, the entity is now held as a joint venture, and emissions from that entity are now accounted as Scope 3 emissions."
"Scope 3 Sources Not Reported As demonstrated in this year s reporting, Linde continues to assess ways to expand and refine Scope 3 reporting, in ways that lend transparency and repeatability ."
"Linde does not report emissions in the following categories: employee commuting, upstream leased assets, downstream tr ansportation and distribution, franchises and waste generated in operations."
These emissions have been calculated or estimated and were determined to be not relevant due to their very small contribution to Linde's Scope 3 footprint.
"Linde currently does not report emissions from processing of sold products, use of sold products and end -of-life treatment of sold products."
"Linde is at the beginning of numerous value chains and provides many intermediate products with many downstream applications, each of wh ich has a very different GHG profile."
Linde does not estimate the downstream emissions associated with the various end uses of all its produ ct but is currently evaluating methodologies that will provide feasible estimates .
The company expects to continue t o expand its reporting in the future.

It counts projects where benefits are fully realized as well as projects that were implemented in 2021 and are still accruing benefits.
"These projects provided GHG savings from enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings, process es and the transportation fleet."
"Information on the projects, including investment made and cost savings, can be found in Linde s CDP response, which is available at the end of July at: https://www.linde.com/ -/media/linde/merger/documents/sustainable- development/2022 -cdp-response -climate- change.pdf ."
Customer GHG Benefits A subset of Linde applications enabled customers and end users to avoid 88 million metric tons of CO2e in 2021;see page 20.
"Such emissions represent avoided emissions, which are sometimes referred to as Scope 4."
"72 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report 305-7 NOx, SOx, and other significant air emissions NOx Emissions NOx emissions were 12,236 metric tons in 2021."
This is an increase of 1.7 percent from 2020 and is attributed to normal variability in sampling.
"SOx Emissions SOx emissions were 714 metric tons in 2021, a 9.6 percent decrease from 2020, mainly due to improvements in stack flow data used in calculations as well as the increasing implementation of national standards for fuels with lower sulfur content."
"VOC Emissions VOC emissions were 948 metric tons in 2021, a 16.9 percent decrease from 2020, mainly du e to updates in standard emissions factors."
"Calculation Methodology NOx, SOx and VOC emissions from plants are taken from emissions monitoring systems or are estimated based on operations data where emissions monitoring is not required by local regulatio ns."
SOx emissions from transport are estimated based on sulfur concentration in local fuel using local transport knowledge and legislative limits.
NOx and VOC emissions from transport are calculated based on estimated diesel con sumption rates and local regulatory limits.
Emissions factors are sourced from the U.

The company makes efforts to reduce waste generation and to reduce waste to landfill through initiatives in operations and programs such as the Zero Waste program .
Hazardous Waste Linde uses local country regulations to define and report hazardous waste.
Linde tracks the amount of hazardous waste recycled but does not track the portion of this that is sold.
Linde estimates that about half of recycled hazardous waste is marketable.
"In 2021, Linde recycled 8,000 metric tons of hazardous waste, including 4,000 metric tons of marketable and 4,000 metric tons of non -marketable hazardous waste."
Linde reports the half that is not marketable in the table below as part of hazardous waste generated.
"Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 73 306-1, 306- 2, 306- 3, 306- 4, 306- 5, In 2021, total hazardous waste generated ( this does not include hazardous waste that is sold for recycling, as this is considered a product) was 21,500 metric tons, which is a 13.7 percent decrease from 2020, largely due to a reduction in waste process material from one large site."
This accounts for more than half of the global waste in this category.
"Non-hazardous Waste Total non -hazardous waste disposed in 202 1 was 15,900 metric tons, which is a 36 percent decrease from 2020 ."
"The main reasons for the significant decrease are construction, turnaround and cylinder scrapping activities in 2020 that were not required in 2021."
Note that non -hazardous waste was restated for 2020.
This was due to a reporting update at two sites.
Zero Waste Program Linde is committed to reducing hazardous and non -hazardous waste.
Lindes Zero Waste program is an effort that has existed for more than a decade.
Sites work to divert at least 90 percent of the normal waste from going to landfill.
"The program encourages a practice, prioritizing reduction of waste generation at the source."
"Therefore, in addition to recycling and other reclamation efforts, many sites have incorporated initiatives that not only reduce waste but also extend conservation principles in the commu nity and help foster economic opportunity."
"By the end 2021, more than 700 sites participated in the program, collectively diverting more than 260 million pounds from landfills ."
See page 28 of this report for information on the Zero Waste Program and perfo rmance against the SD 2028 Zero Waste target.
Significant Spills There were no significant spills in 202 1.
"Transport of Hazardous Waste Linde did not transport, import or export hazardous waste across international borders in 202 1."

"Significant fines are those costing more than $10,000."
See EN(16).
There were two significant fines assessed to Linde for non -compliance with environmental laws or regulations that occurred in 2021.
Linde is not aware of any non -monetary sanctions for environmental non- compliance or any actions brought through dispute resolution mechanisms involving an independent third- party review.
"Environmental Violations and Fines 2018 Linde Pro Forma 2019 Linde 2020 Linde 2021 Linde Number of Violations 0 2 0 2 Value of Fines Related to Above 0 $142 ,000 0 $52,000 EN (1 7): Environmental Violations and Fines Units: USD 308-1 New suppliers that were screened using environmental criteria One-hundred percent of suppliers that present environmental risk are screened using environmental criteria."
308-2 Significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts in the supply chain and actions taken Linde values its supplier relationships and works to develop supplier capacity.
Linde uses a risk -based approach to supplier management.
"Those suppliers at risk of negative environmental impacts are principally suppliers of chemicals, or process and specialty gas suppliers, and all are subject to additional pre- qualification requirements."
These qualifications are revisited in periodic audits and in any contract re- qualification.
Those that show an unwillingness or inability to conform are subject to disciplinary action up to and including contract termination.
"Connecting with Our Communities to Support the Next Generation Community is one of Lindes corporate values, and employees around the globe are proud of the companys tradition of creating resilience in the communities where we live and work."
One of the priority areas of Lindes corporate philanthropy strategy is education: The companys Global Giving program provided more than $4 million in funding to educational programs.
"As well, nearly one-third of Lindes Community Engagement projects primary or secondary focus area involve opportunities to better prepare students, from providing underserved children with resources to efforts in environmental literacy."
"Strong educational systems can promote stronger communities, and strong ties to community and education stakeholders can help to focus efforts on unique solutions."
Two exemplars from India and the United States are among the many global efforts buoyed by both the talents of Linde volunteers and the companys philanthropic giving.
"Linde Engineering (LE)s expertise is building, so it is no surprise that helping to improve the infrastructure of schools is a community need the business embraces."
"For LE India, helping to support such projects has become a tradition: The team has helped to fund schools in Kural and Bhayali, and in 2021, supported the construction of the Primary School in Navapura, the rural center of the Vadodara district where LE is located."
"We noticed that the existing school building was in a very poor condition, and that many children in Navapura had limited access to the educational infrastructure, explained Chitra Parmar, Communications Manager at Linde Engineering India."
"We decided to connect with the community and see how we can help, as we didnt want the children to suffer from the lack of education."
"The team saw their efforts as a way to foster long-term outcomes, such as increasing skills, employment potential and higher quality of life, which are among the outcomes tracked in the assessment of Lindes CE projects."
The new school is scheduled to open in 2022.
Students are not the only beneficiaries of such projects.
"In Lindes collaboration with CELF, the Childrens Environmental Literacy Foundation, Linde has collaborated for many years on programs that not only engage children, but their teachers as well."
"Environmental sustainability is the focus of these programs, which in 2021 occurred in Linde communities in Danbury, Connecticut, Houston, Texas and Tonawanda, New York."
"What I like most about CELF is that they maximize the benefit that they provide to the communities by training teachers, who then train their students about which actions to take to make a difference in life, explained Bradley Damstedt, Senior Technology Expert in Combustion R&D, who leads the collaboration with CELF."
"The programs use real-world problem-solving to prepare students with critical thinking skills and motivation to become agents of change for a healthier, more stable, and sustainable future."
"CELF interventions include consulting for schools, professional development for teachers, and innovative programs for students."
"The projects in 2021 focused on air quality and pollution, and the outcomes are expected to be impactful for teachers and students alike: ""Linde's long-term support of CELF has been pivotal to our work equipping teachers with pedagogical skills and resources to cultivate students' understanding of the interconnections between social, economic and ecological systems, and their sense of agency to take action toward solutions."
"Linde's commitment has helped enable our small but mighty team to reach over 15,000 teachers and 1.5 million students,"" said Tara Stafford Ocansey, Executive Director of CELF."
These community connections demonstrate a simple educational concept: multiplication.
"By seeding these efforts with Linde time and resources, children are given more opportunities to reach even higher heights in their future."
"For more information on how Linde demonstrates the corporate value of Community and how Linde assesses the impact of Community Engagement activities, see Community on the Linde website."

"Linde is dependent upon its highly skilled, experienced and efficient workforce to be successful."
"Much of Linde's competitive advantage is based on the expertise and experience of its key personnel in marketing, technology, manufacturing, distribution infrastructure, systems and products."
"The inability to attract and hire qualified individuals , or the loss of key employees in very skilled areas , could have a negative effect on the company's financial results."
"Investments in employee training and development bring value, but this is often hard to measure, or of indirect business benefit."
The challenge in this area is to create training interventions that bring direct learning and measurable business benefits.
Development training is an important investment.
Such training brings value in many ways to employees and to the company.
The Talent Development team has conducted needs assessments to ensure that potential programs met the needs of th e company.
One key goal was to increase the engagement and efficiency of the companys people managers.
"Some key e- learning initiatives resulted, and these programs are now increasingly employ ing technology in training and development."
"Two examples of continued deployment of e- learning include the use of Skillsoft and the diversity and inclusion programs, such as Inclusion Boost ."
"Due to the global pandemic, the use of e- learning and vi rtual platforms has become the dominant mode of training, with widespread utilization in areas including compliance, safety and inclusion training ."
"Examples below depict typical programs offered, although all may not have been offered in 202 1 due to constraints because of the pandemic."
"84 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report Many e -learning programs exist throughout the globe , with both formal training events and opportunities for webinars : For example, t he Strengthening the Pipeline program, which is part of the strategy to support Lindes 30 by 30 diversity goal, provides a hybrid -training opportunity comprised of webinars, self -paced learning, coaching and self -assessment."
Employee Learning and Development The careers and career paths of Linde employees are strategically managed.
Employees and management use a range of competence- based and goal- setting tools.
"Employees store and maintain resumes, experience, completed training, certifications achieved, performa nce appraisals and career goals and aspirations."
Career paths are planned in conversations with their managers against competency ladders.
"These plans are us ed for talent development , succession planning and internal recruitment."
"Linde has invested in Elevate My Learning, a learning management system (LMS) platform that facilitates global reporting of formal training."
The data reported below is a subset of all the company -sponsored formal training provided.
"The LMS system enables all businesses and functions to house, track and offer training and training -related information on a single enterprise platform."
Linde continues to explore new ways to expand the use of the system .
"Linde reports an average of 20 hours of training globally (regional average); however, these hours vary depending on training needs and budgets."
See SOC (8).
"In 20 21, the company continued to expand the use of technology to offer significant training with increased efficiency of time and cost: The company s e-learning offerings have reached m ore than 4,000 employees."
"Nearly 26,000 courses, videos and other resources were taken, representing more than 66,000 training hours."
The company continued the use of e- learning for business integrity and other training.
"Globally, this is typically approximately 20,000 employees."

"413-1 Percentage of operations with implemented local community engagement, impact assessments and development programs Community is a core value at Linde: We are committed to improving the communities where we live and work."
"Our charitable contributions, along with employee volunteerism, support initiatives that make important and sustainable contributions to our world."
The company s commitment to community is executed through two philanthropic program arms: Community engagement represents employee- and corporate- led programmatic efforts in communities where the company has a presence.
"Charitable contributions through Linde's Global Giving P rogram, which provides financial, philanthropic support in the form of scholarships, contributions and support for employee volunteerism and matching gifts."
"Both of these stra tegic arms are aligned and work together to provide a significant, lasting value to local communities, to positively impact t he company's reputation, and to develop and engage employees."
"Strategically, the programs work to deepen impact, engage employees a nd drive business goals, complementing the corporate mission of making our world more productive."
"In Linde, many community engagement projects are also supported by the Global Giving Program ."

One hundred percent of Linde businesses participated in employee volunteer community engagement activities in 20 21.
413- 1 Businesses also provide charitable development through the company s Global Giving Program.
Impact assessments are performed on all reported community engagement efforts and on significant and long- term projects supported by the Global Giving Program.
"413- 1 92 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report Community Engagement Overview and Strategic Focus Since being formally launched in 2009 , community engagement remains strong."
"In 20 21, all Linde businesses participated in employee volunteer community engagement activities , and Linde employees spearheaded 389 projects across the globe."
These projects represent the efforts of approximately 457 sites.
"Frequently, sites collaborate on projects."
"In 20 21, 24 percent of Linde community engagement projects were sponsored by more than one site."
"The incidence of volunteerism a measure of the number of times individual employees engaged with the community reached nearly 10,000."
The company has a healthy mix of established projects and a growing pipeline of new efforts launched to address changing needs.
"Approximately 5 percent of projects have continued for more than 10 years, and more than half -- approximately 56 percent of projects in 202 1-- were new initiatives , reflecting the start of new projects, often virtual, as the world deals with the continuing pandemic ."
"Community engagement projects are classified by focus area s: environment, health, education , diversity and general community support."
These focus areas parallel the focus areas of the Global Giving Program.
"See SOC (13a), SOC (13b) and EC (2)."
"Nearly half (47 percent ) of community engagement projects are in the priority focus areas of education, diversity and environment."
"These support the strategic priorities aligned with the business: Education especially STEM edu cation and diversity are critical to a robust , talented pipeline."
"As well, environmental responsibility is a key priority for the company ."
"In addition to several climate change targets , the SD 2028 targets include targets for diversity and increased philanthropic spend in the area of environment."
Examples of company projects include: Education : Support to enable students access to learning resources is a focus of many community projects.
The Surface Technologies business in Indianapolis has donated educational supplies to students an d teachers at the nearby school.
"As well, HyCO team members in Clear Lake, Texas, sponsored a STEM camp for students in the Houston area."
Diversity MLK Literacy Kits: Linde employees in the U.
S. donate books annually to support literacy in honor of the Rev.
"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday."
"Many members of the REACH employee resource grou p, which represents employees of African and African American heritage, participate in this project ."
Environment Teams are actively working to protect ecosystems in our communities.
"For e xample, employees from the Linde Technology Center in Tonawanda , New York, participate in the local annual Shoreline Sweep."
This event mobilizes volunteers to collect li tter and debris near the shoreline to protect ecosystems in Wester n New York.
"In the Bangna office in Thailand, employee teams helped to build dams in Thailand s second largest national park, Thap Lan National Park."
These dams help retain water for use later during dry periods and preserve humidity in the forests.
These eff orts also are beneficial to local organ isms.
"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Linde's SD 2028 Goals and Community Engagement Community engagement efforts seek to make a lasting impact on communities and to address enduring problems."
Linde has tracked projects against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the past several years.
Linde's Community Engagement P rogram supports the SDGs.
Approximately 87 percent of the community engagement projects addressed specific SDGs.
"These foci also reflect congruence with Linde's priority areas, focusing on development in the areas of environment, di versity/inclusion and education."
Several programs contribute to SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth (to achieve decent work and employment for men and women by 2030) and its subsets.
The company s SKILLS PIPELINE workforce development program is directly tied to the SDG for decent work and economic growth (to achieve decent work and employment for men and women by 2030).
"In 2016, the program was expanded from the Louisiana inaugural effort to China."
"In 2017, the program was expanded to Indiana in the area of advanced manufacturing."
"In 2018, the program was further expanded t o other geographies in welding."
"In 2019, the program expanded to professional truck driving, in a program focused on transition ing soldiers."
The program saw the graduation of the one hundredth soldier at the end of 2021.
"Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 93 In addition to the driving program, with the help of collaborating colleges, two other programs continued during the pandemic in 2021 : First, the program s offering for d ual-credit students in East Chicago, IN, which provides an early start to college and preparation for careers in production maintenance technology , continued into 2021 , graduating the first class ."
"In addition, the advanced manufacturing program in Danbury, CT , welcomed a second cohort."
"In 2022 , Linde looks forward to further geographic and skills area expansion for this program , including programs in Western New York and California."
Recognition and Incentives to Grow Impact Enthusiasm for community engagement is complemented by Linde's global award for Community Engagement.
"Introduced in 2009, thi s recognition from Linde's CEO honors successful efforts that demonstrate a high level of commitment and impact."
"In 2021, exemplary projects from each business or region were recognized, along with five global winners."
Award- winning project teams are honored and receive a significant charitable donation.
Projects are recognized for outcomes as well as strategic alignment with company goals.
"Charitable awards, when possible, are designated to the original beneficiary organization to enable the project teams to deepen their efforts, and, ultimately, to increase the impact on communities."
"Strategy Three strategic elements for comm unity engagement are deepen, engage and drive."
Deepen Community need is a primary driver of community engagement.
Projects are dictated by the needs of local communities combined with the desire and ability of local project teams to help a ddress these needs.
Linde community engagement is a proactive outreach to help build community resilience.
"In order to facilitate needs assessment s, the company has conducted training on incorporating community needs assessments when determining projects, and guidance for needs assessment s is included in the community engagement reporting tool."
Sites are encouraged to build strong relationships with local communities.
"In order to identify and meet local needs, community engagement is frequently conducted with partners, including local government agencies, suppliers, customers and community groups."
These partnerships help deepen and extend the ability to help build resilient communities.
Engage Community engagement is considered a leadership activity and is initiated by volunteers.
It is also a way to increase awareness of community needs.
"Linde often incorporates community engagement at company -spon sored meetings and conferences, and the company uses these events to develop employee skills and company networks; the company has done so formally since 2012."
"With the support and participation of business leaders, these events continue to spur additional community engagement participation in locations around the globe."
A hallmark of engagement at Linde has been the annual Earth Week celebration.
"In place formally since 2012, Earth Week is an opportunity for employees and teams around the world to engage in personal and corporate acts of environmental responsibility, mirr oring the culture at Linde every day."
"Projects often involve community activities, including tree planting, roadside clean -ups and school educational events."
Employees also share individual environmentally friendly acts.
"Linde's Global Giving Program th en ""matches"" each act with a donation ."
The 2021 Earth Week celebration at Linde reflected the Earth Day Network theme : Restore Our Earth .
"Due to the continuing COVID -19 health crisis, the focus of participation shifted from local activities and projects to online support and virtual activities related to education and the environment, as well as other community support."
Thousands of em ployees worldwide participated in Linde s Earth Week celebration .
"These voluntary actions resulted in donations to Seed Programs International, supporting up to 75,000 pounds of vegetables in areas where hunger is a pressing concern."
Linde s Earth Week past donations have supported irrigation and gardening projects with the AMDAE organization in Colombia (Asociaci on Mutual para el Desarrollo integral de la Afrocolombianidad y el Empresarismo).
The goal of the project is to help integrate displaced members 94 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report of the Afro -Colombian community into their new homes in other parts of Colombia.
"The goal of the farm is to house, feed and economically support 40 people."
They integrate knowledge and customs from their past into modern farming techniques.
Th e farm is a cultural learning center available to all Colombians.
The model farm shares all aspects of Afro -Colombian culture with the general community.
"Such programs not only have social impact, but also environmental impact."
They also support Linde s strategic goal to engage employees.
"In addition to the camaraderie, community engagement also helps to develop leadership and other beneficial skills for all employees."
Employees participate in design contests for museum exhibits and help to build skills by organizing activities in local communities.
"Employees continue to affirm the value of time spent in these activities, and community engagement has been cited as a factor that cont ributes to choosing to join Linde for employment."
Employees also direct mu ch of the spending from Linde's Global Giving Program.
"Through matching gifts and employee volunteer grants, the Global Giving Program helps employees benefit charities in their communities."
About 12 percent of the Global Giving Program is employee- directed.
The matching gifts program also includes countries outside of the U.
S. Drive Driving impact through community engagement is the third main strategic objective.
"Along with employee- led efforts, Linde's corporate- led community engagement efforts work to confirm its mission and align with business drivers through strategic initiatives, especially in the STEM fields."
These programs directly help to increase the number of skilled men and women in the workforce.
"In addition, both illustrate that the Linde community engagement program and Linde's Global Giving P rogram work hand -in-hand."
"The skills gap comprises problems for many stakeholders: - Workers: Lack of preparedness for the underemployed and unemployed - Colleges: Disconnects between training and industry expectations - Industry: Increased cost or project delays due to training or retraining In certain programs, students also earn college credi t, allow ing students to stack credits transferable to degree programs, in addition to gaining industry -relevant credentials and exposure to potential employment opportunities."
"The SKILLS PIPELINE program offers a multi -faceted approach to workforce development, including community awareness campaigns, scholarships to provide training for skilled workers, professional development opportunities, support to increase the skills of incumbent workers and instructorships for teachers."
"In 202 1, Linde also saw the graduations from workforce development efforts, including transitioning soldiers in the company s SKILLS PIPELINE workforce development program in driving."
"Some of these graduates have found a place in industry post -transition, and some are working for Linde businesses, demonstrating the ability of programs such as those in the SKILLS PIPELINE family t o address the skilled- crafts gap that exists in industry."
"In 202 2, the company is considering expansion to other skill areas critical for Linde, and to more geographical locations outside of t he U."
S. Linde has supported schools and training centers for welding technology outside of the U.
"S., especially in regions with low levels of average income, by providing the necessary equipment and expertise."
Such programs contribute to improving local living conditions and enhancing equal opportunities.
"Community Input With a presence in approximately 10 0 countries, Linde is, at its core, a local company."
"As the company is a member of numerous individual local neighborhoods, communities are one of its relevant stakeholders."
For the process for determining Linde stakeholders and engaging those stakeholder groups see the section commencing on page 35.
"Linde integrates their feedback into its process to determine priority factors, key performance indicators and the company s SD 2028 targets."
"Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 95 Community relations begin with the initial entry into a new area, and the company continues to be part of the neighborhoods where its facilities have a presence and where its team members live and work."
"Being a good neighbor includes not only understanding community needs to s et up or volunteer in suitable community engagement activities but also to communicat e crucial information, and to listen to and consider opinions, questions 8 and concerns."
"In its Responsible Care Global Policy, the company defines general guiding principles regarding communications with external stakeholders like communities and procedures to periodically assess their questions and concerns, implement suitable communication processes and measu re performance."
"The policy also provides the responsibilities for business heads and o perations heads, accordingly."
"Linde communicates information about product hazards and safe handling, safety, health and environmental programs and performance, as appropriate."
This also inclu des sharing emergency preparedness plans with community representatives.
The effectiveness of the company s stakeholder communications programs is evaluated regularly.
"As for all other stakeholders, the company s standard of responsible behavior towards communities is confirmed by Linde s Code of Business Integrity."
"Formal ways to co ntact Linde can be found on the website, for both email and phone inquiries."
"Linde employees and teams pay close attention to local needs through activities, such as joining community committees, attending local town meetings, providing public safety awareness, hosting educational community events and engaging with relevant nonprofit and/or community organizations."
Linde hosts community informational events in neighborhoods near operations and builds close relationships wit h local providers of emergency services.
Community events are often a part of workforce development programming as well as engagement between businesses and neighborh oods.
"In addition, the company's pipeline business has frequent events to educate the community about the busi ness and the importance of safety."
"As part of the continuing focus on community relations and as part of its SD 2028 goals, Linde has committed to including com munity needs considerations in 100 percent of its large engineering projects ."
Activity begins i n 202 2.
The Community Impact Assessment is made by the business and project execution teams during the planning of new and/or significant expansions of Linde sites.
"It includes a discussion with key stakeholders in the community, which may include representatives from municipalities and community organizations; understanding community needs; and a proposal of potential ways to address these community needs and bring positive impact, especially through social, educational or environmental initiatives."
Assessment of Impact: Starting with Need Ending with Impact Linde assesses the short - and long -term impac ts generated by its philanthropic activity.
"By understanding community needs and how the company can best help address them, impacts are anticipated at th e beginning and then measured at appropriate times during projects."
The company assesses the impact of its Community E ngagement and Global Giving Programs and performs environmental impact assessments.
96 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report Community Engagement Impact Assessment Impactful projects are the goal of all community engagement efforts.
Linde's most recent Sustainable Development Materiality Assessment (SDMA) identified community engagement as a priority for Linde and its stakeholders.
"Goals and targets are developed and maintained based on the SDMA, managed and reported in the SDMS and published in this report , the 2020 Sustainable Development Report and in the annual Community Engagement Brochure."
Linde's strong culture of execution complements its efforts to measure the impact of community engagement.
"As in prior years, Linde measures and reports the social and environmental impact and outcomes, as well as the employee and company benef its, of community engagement based upon a methodology develo ped by the United Kingdom -based LBG report, Making a Difference."
"Before t he start of community engagement efforts, project teams focus on desired outcomes from the projects."
"At the conclusion of eac h project, the teams measure benefits, as reported by volunteers and/or beneficiaries."
"Increasingly, third parties help to validate project benefits."
"Inputs Inputs are measured by the number of hours, number of sites participating and incidence of volunteerism ."
"Results in 202 1 reflect the decreased activity in light of the pandemic compared to recent years, but increasing from 2020 ."
"Participation grew from 2020 , as well as incidence of volunteerism."
See SOC (14) .
"Outputs Outputs are measured by the number of beneficiaries, money raised and goods donated."
"Linde volunteers brought direct benefits to approximately 250,000 people, including approximately 100,000 students."
Results in 2021 reflect the decreased project size in light of the pandemi c.
See SOC (15) .
"Additionally, projects reported funds that employees and facilities raised or donated in support of community engagement."
"In addition to funding from the Linde Global Giving Program, employees and facilities raised or donated more than $ 2.8 million in cash and in- kind donations, including food, clothing, trees/seedlings and other forms of in -kind support."
This contribution included approximately $ 2.4 million in cash contributions from employees and facilities.
"As a part of efforts to continually validate the program, the cash compo nent of this reported contribution was independently verified by an external party for 202 1."
"Impacts Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 97 Key impacts are reported as benefits to project recipients, employee volunteers and to the company."
Linde has compared the performance of these metrics over time and continues to see a positive impact overall.
Trends seen in 202 1 are due to the change in the type of volunteerism projects as well as reporting challenges due to the global pandemic.
"Projects are increasingly virtual, with smaller teams as employees continue to find creative ways to address community needs."
See SOC (1 6).
"Beneficiary Benefits In 87 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement created a positive impact on the attitudes of recipients."
"In 71 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement provided recipients with job skills or opportunities for personal growth."
"In 91 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement had a direct impact on the recipients' quality of life."
"Employee Benefits In 82 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement helped to increase their own personal growth and effectiveness."

"In 84 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement positively impacted their outlook on Linde and/or their job."
"In 86 percent of projects, volunteers repo rted that community engagement gave them a better awareness of the community."
Company Benefits Benefits to Linde are measured in terms of increased engagement with customers and employees and impact on reputation.
"In 35 percent of projects, volunteers reported that the community engagement projects gave the opportunity to engage with customers."
"In 85 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement helped to build employee engagement."
"The impact on reputation is also assessed separately: I n approximately 69 percent of projects, volunteers reported that community engagement projects were likely to increase awareness of Linde."
"In more than half of these instances, teams reported that third parties have provided validation of their efforts or the posi tive impact of their project(s)."
"Longer term, Linde assesses the impact on multiple stakeholders from signature efforts."
Considered impacts are both qualitati ve and quantitative.
"For example, students who have participated in the company s SKILLS PIPELINE program have reported high levels of preparation and increased quality of life and self -sufficiency."
"Linde has seen increased engagement with customers and suppliers, and, ultimately, available skilled talent to meet current demands for workers."
It is tr uly a win -win.
Building Communities Building Leaders Community engagement programs often give employees opportunities to build leadership and other skills such as project management .
Prior voluntary offering s at Linde included training where employees can learn more about voluntary board service and the multiple skills offered through such experiences.
"Several employees have expressed interest or have joined non -profit boards after attending such training, increa sing engagement with the community."
"Community Impact Business Impact Linde has seen increased engagement with customers and suppliers, and ultimately, available skilled talent to meet current demands for workers."
"Graduates from the company s SKILLS PIPELINE program have been hired by Linde, its customers and other members of industry."
Graduates leave the program with industry -recognized credentials.
"The program also introduces skills to diverse populations, including women and veterans."
"The program is marketed broadly across the community at large, increasing awareness of opportunities to those who may be historically represented in career fields."
"For example, the graduating classes for the welding programs in Louisiana included a significant number of women graduates: The first graduating class in Louisiana was comprised of approximately 21 percent women."
"The second class, which graduated in 2017, was comprised of approximately 17 percent women."
"The East Chicago cohort, which graduated in 2021, was com prised of a majority of first -generation college students."
"98 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report Global Giving Impact Assessment Since 2014, the company's Global Giving Program has strategically performed impact assessments, also based upon the LBG methodology."
Large contributions above a predetermined threshold and long- term contributions are assessed to ensure that outcomes have b een achieved.
The result of such assessments is annually reviewed by the Global Giving advisory board.
Environmental Impact Assessment Community impact is a broad consideration at Linde and extends beyond employee philanthropy.
Environmental impact assess ments are performed in advance of all Linde capital investments.
Plant leadership often participates in town meetings to provide inform ation and answer questions.
Ongoing monitoring is provided through Linde's cycle of safety and environmental internal ass essments.
Linde continues to consider ways to further reach and align with local communities.

"Tree planting projects around the globe, such as those conducted by Linde teams in Seoul, not only help to beautify areas but also combat erosion."
"In 2021, Linde teams planted more than 30,000 trees throu gh community engagement efforts."
"Linde's pipeline community education events, STEM programs and workforce development programs are examples of the ways that Linde aims to make positive, relevant impact in communities."
Programs also provide opportunities t o develop skills and increase quality of life.
"Notably, Linde s SKILLS PIPELINE workforce development program presented new opportunities to community members traditionally underrepresented in some career fields, for example women in welding."
"Through the workforce development program in commercial truck driving, soldiers exiting from the military gain skills and credentials before they transition to civilian life."
"Linde conducts community events in many neighborhoods, including those near its pipelines."
"Linde s pipeline safety team typically joins industry peers , traditionally co-hosting approximately 30 s uch events each year ."
"These help to introduce communities to t he importance of safety and to increase familiarity with the industry, facilities and products."
"The company s SKILLS PIPELINE workforce development program is indicative of th is collaboration with local communities as well as other members of industry, academia and/or government."
"These programs are intended to have positive economic impact for communities and for individuals and have been well regarded by legislators, industry groups and academic leadership as offering a creative solution to address a recognized need."
These programs build communities by providing resources that potentially impact long- term quality of life.
"Many projects also help to address basic needs in the community, such as food insecurity."
"In Tonawanda, New York, for example, team members volunteer over their own lunch breaks to deliver food to elderly, homebound members of the community."
The company s teams also work with local communities as they enter new geographies.
"As part of its SD 202 8 goals, Linde has a target to include community needs assessments in 100 percent of new, large execution projects, with pilots starting in the Americas."
"Plant leadership often participates in town meetings to provide information and answer questions , and new projects are often an opportunity to learn about and help address community needs."
"Linde Engineering has increased engagement for several years, working cooperatively with communities to establish new schools."
These types of needs assessments and conversations continue to formalize.
"Additionally, charitable funds, in -kind donations and resources contribute t o the overall positive impact on local communities."
"In 20 21, these include d: Cash contributions from the Global Giving Program: $ 9.7 million In-kind donations raised and donated, including food, clothing, seedlings, product donations and other , but not including cash raised or donated: $2.1 million (including approximately $ 400,000 through the Community Engagement Program and an additional $1.7 million through the Global Giving Program representing product donations such as Linde gases. )"
"Approximate value of service by Linde volunteers: $800,000 Approximate value of management support/overheads: $ 500,000, including fees paid to external organizations for vetting and processing organizations, included in cash contributions above, as well as an approximation of the staff time to manage the Global Givin g and Community Engagement Programs."
(Note: Programs are internally managed; Linde does not charge overhead to these programs.)
102 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report 414-1 New suppliers that were screened using social rights criteria Suppliers are key to Linde s ability to meet its customer needs.
"One hundred percent of new suppliers are screened at the prequalification sta ge for social issues, including compliance with labor and employment laws, ethics and integrity, safety, human rights, environmental aspects and fi nancial stability."
"For qualification, suppliers and contractors must agree to ensure compliance with their contractual commitments and Linde s CBI and Supplier Code of Conduct, including its Human Rights commitment s therein , or demonstrate a comparable commitment to business integrity and human rights via t heir own policies."
"The company's supplier agreements routinely include language that require its suppliers to obey international conventions and national and regional statutory requirements in the countries in which they operate, including any applicable national laws regarding human trafficking, forced labor and other forms of modern slavery."
"It is currently developing standard language for terms and conditions, which will be included, where applicable, in future contracts."
"The Procurement organization regularly discusses these expectations with suppliers upon qualification contracting and during any audits conducted, including for 100 percent of critical Tier 1 suppliers."
The executive management team communicates with the company's top- tier suppliers annually to reinforce its commitment to its policies and to remind suppliers of their obligations in contracting with the company.
"In particular, the executives reaffirm that the company expec ts business dealings with suppliers to be based on fai rness, honesty, lawfulness, safety, environmental stewardship and social consciousness."
"It continues to assess the effectiveness of its strategy and, where appropriate, adopt policies and practices that improve its program."
"414-2 Negative social impacts in the supply chain and actions taken Suppliers are assessed for social impacts broadly defined, including safety and compliance, which are included within Linde s basic operational policies and procedures."
"In the areas that are integral to these operational policies and procedures, such as safety, integrity and co mpliance, labor standards and anti-discrimination, issues such as non -compliance and remediation are dealt with on an ongoing basis , and no additional action is required."

"Groups that are specifically assessed include Linde employees, suppliers, third- party contracted labor and children/adolescents, women, migrant and minority popu lations."
"The VP, Sustainability, reviews material in the media and annual human rights reports issued by the U."
S. Department of State (DOS).
"In 2019, this review was expanded to include all Linde countries."
"For 2021, it was determined that these reports did not indicate new human rights risks, and no new action was taken."
"Human Rights Risk Assessment There is concern that a small portion of suppliers, or their suppliers, including Linde s Surface Technologies business and the company s engineering business , could be sourcing materials from ""conflict zones"" where there is a risk of human rights violations."
"Conflict Minerals in Electronic Materials: Based on Linde's commitment to governance, compli ance and human rights, the most salient human rights issue associated with Linde activities and business relationships is the issue of potential ""conflict minerals"" in its supply chain."
"Certain minerals (including tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) have been linked with funding killings, violence, rape and other human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other conflict zones."
"These affect all citizens in these regions, particularly women, childr en and adolescents."
Linde has determined that approximately 13 percent of its 2021 consolidated sales relate to products that Linde manufactures or contracts to manufacture that may contain necessary conflict minerals .
"To mitigate potential human rights violations in the ""conflict minerals"" supply chain, Linde s due diligence process conforms, in all material respects, with the framework set forth in th e OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict -Affected and High -Risk Areas (OECD Guidance) and the related supplements for gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten."
Linde has adopted a Conflict Materials Supply Policy.
Thi s policy is available on Linde s website at https://www.linde.com/ - /media/linde/merger/documents/global- procurement/linde- conflict -free-materials -supply -policy.pdf?la=en .
"Lind es due diligence process 104 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report includes monitoring the performance and continual improvement of its suppliers, and, where relevant, with their suppliers, an d reporting to the U."
"S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on Linde s website at: https://irpages2.eqs.com/websites/lindeplc/English/3210/us -sec- filing.html?shortDesc=Specialized%20Disclosure%20Report&format=html&secFilingId=c95d0563 -d23d -4065 -97b1 -fbcbe8460328 ."
Linde continues to work with these suppliers to ensure conformance with its policy and standards and with applicable law.
Slavery in Supply Chain : Linde has policies in conformance with country regulation.
"For example, in the UK, Linde has published a policy in conformance with The U."
"K. Modern Anti -Slavery Act of 2015 that reiterates its ""opposition to the use of all forms of child, compulsory or forced labor at our operations and establishes the expectation that our business partners, suppliers and contra ctors will demonstrate similar intolerance for such practices."""
Sex Trafficking on Truck Driving Routes: Linde works with major NGOs active in this area to train its network of employee and contractor truck drivers to help mitigate this crime.
"Voluntary a ction is ongoing in Brazil, U."
"S. and Canada, and in 2019 , was extended to Mexico."
"Monitoring, Communication and T raining Regular reviews are conducted across all regions to confirm that processes are set up to ensure compliance with corporate policies, including human rights, compliance, safety and employment, and labor standards."
Many of these themes fall under regular Linde management and are managed through those functions.
"Current procedures in place would allow for up to termination ( for employees) or discontinuation of contracts ( for suppliers), if any confirmed human rights violations were found."
"See 404 -1 for a description of training and other programs to reinforce compliance, safety and fair labor practices."
"Human Rights Grievances To Linde's knowledge, in 20 21, there were no grievances related to human rights filed through formal organizational grievance mechanisms by individuals or groups, internal or external, to the organization and none through the Integrity Hotline."

"SOC (1 7): Human Rights Due Diligence Process 414-2 106 Linde 202 1 Sustainable Development Report 415-1 Total value of political contributions by country and recipient/beneficiary Linde does not make any political contributions as a company, neither to political parties nor candidates."
In the U.
"S., employees have formed a political action committee (PAC)."
"Under the umbrella of this independent registered committee, employees collect donations to politicians, political parties and associations and make their own decisions as to how the funds will be used."
The PAC Executive Committee has broad employee representation and approves all political contributions made on behalf of the PAC.
The Linde PAC is governed by a series of internal policies and adheres to a strict set of by -laws.
"Following the merger, t he PAC for Linde GmbH (previously Linde AG) North America was terminated in 2019, and all activities were conducted through the Praxair PAC , which is now the Lind e PAC."
"In 2021 to the beginning of 2022, total PAC contributions totaled $19,000 to local, state and federal candidates for elected office representing both political parties."
(Scope: U.
"S., not including Lincare, which has a separate PAC with disbursement s of approximately $15,000 in 2021 .)"
"Policy -related data reported below includes : contributions to political campaigns (from the Linde PAC) , as well as Linde s contributions to trade associations, tax-exempt organizations and lobbying firms."
"In 20 21, the total contribution was approximately $3.3 million , of which more than half was for trade associations and tax -exempt organizations ."
See SOC (18) and SOC (19).
There was no spending on ballot measures or referendums.
Political contributions receipts and disbursements are reported in detail and disclosed publicly.
This detail can be found on the U .

Public Advocacy Issues The two largest public policy advocacy issues for 2021 were medical oxygen access in response to the C OVID -19 pandemic and the promotion of hydrogen as a substitute for fossil fuels.
"Priority: Medical oxygen access in response to COVID -19 Healthcare system and patient access to medical oxygen is a key priority , and healthcare represents a significant portion of Linde s business, approximately 19 percent of revenue in 202 1."
Linde s products contribute positively to the health and wellbeing of our customers.
"Homecare and hospital patients worldwide benef it from our medical gases, devices, services and therapies, especially in respiratory care."
"For example, during the COVID -19 pandemic, Linde medical oxygen was crucial to healthcare responders and their patients in many of our countries."
"For example, in the U."
"S., Lincare is a leading provider of home respiratory - therapy products and services , serving approximately 165,000 patients at home during the pandemic."
"As COVID -19 overwhelmed healthcare facilities around the world, our local teams took extraordinary measures to deliver essential medical oxygen under challenging conditions , and the company s efforts to provide supply have been recognized by external parties."
Priority: Hydrogen as a Substitute for Fossil Fuels Global progress and adoption of hydrogen and other alternatives to fossil fuels is key to global reduction of GHGs and Linde s commitment to its own climate change targets.
"Linde is a global leader in the production, processing, storage and distribution of hydrogen."
It has the largest liquid hydro gen capacity and distribution system in the world.
"The company also operates the world's first high -purity hydrogen storage cavern, coupled with a pipeline network of approximately 1,000 kilometers to reliably supply its customers."
Linde is at the forefront in the transition to clean hydrogen and has installed more than 200 hydrogen fueling stations and 80 hydrogen electrolysis plants worldwide and includes decarbonization investments within its SD 2028 targets.
"Decarbonization is a priority for Linde, with the goal of investing more t han $1 billion investment in decarbonization technologies in large capital projects, where the primary aim of Linde and/or its customers is to reduce GHG emissions or advance the use of low -carbon fuels and energy."
See Leading the Transition to Low Carbon Energy and the Performance Against Targets chapter for more details.
"Linde 2021 Sustainable Development Report 107 415-1 Trade Associations In addition to reporting political contributions, Linde also reports on trade associations in which the company is a member."
See 102-13.
Two of the largest trade associations in which the company is a member include the American Che mistry Council a nd Compressed Gas Association .

": Carbon Verification Service, LLC was engaged by Linde , Inc. to provide assurance of its global 202 1 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and other social metrics."
2021 was the twel fth consecutive year that Car bon Verification Service was retained by the company to verify its KPIs.
(Carbon Verification Service was retained eight years by Praxair prior to the merger) .
"Upon being retained, Carbon Verification Service conducted a conflict o f interest revi ew to en sure that its review would be free of bias and would be done on an independent basis."
"Carbo n Verification Service provides only verification and auditing services to its clients, including Linde , Inc. , to avoid conflict of interest concerns."
Carbon Verif ication Service is not owned or operated by any other entity.
"The objective of the verificati on was to provide limited assurance of the reported KPI values and t o assess the accu racy, completeness, relevance, consistency and transparency of Linde , Inc. 's information and assert ions."
"Carbon Verification Service assessed c onformance of Linde , Inc.s GHG emission inventory with The Greenhouse Gas Protocol."
"The verification protocol employed for verification of Linde , Inc.s 202 1 GHG e missions was ISO 14064 -3 (2006): Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions, and is consistent with the requirements for ISAE 3000 ."
"Consensus protocols for the verification of the KPI metrics, other than GHG emissions, do not currently exist."
Carbon Verific ation Service u tilized the same verificat ion principles prescribed by ISAE 3000 to guide the verification of this data.
