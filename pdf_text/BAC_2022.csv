8 consecutive years of more than $15B in net income We are positioned well for the future.
In the post-pandemic period we have reestablished our organic growth engine.
"For the entirety of the period from 2015 to 2022, we have seen the stock price double; we have produced $185 billion in afer-tax earnings; and we have invested heavily in our franchise to better serve our customers and clients."
Responsible Growth worked in all those environments and produced strong results on an enormous scale.
A simple way to think about this is only four U.
S. companies have earned more than $15 billion in GAAP afer-tax income in each of these eight years.
Your company is one of them.
"More importantly, we are positioned well for the future."
In the post-pandemic period we have reestablished our organic growth engine.
"We have delivered revenue growth, while controlling expense, in a highly volatile environment."
You will note increased costs for 2019 to 2022 above.

"BANK OF AMERICA 2022 | 3 *Pre-tax, pre-provision income is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting consolidated pre-tax income to add back provision for credit loss."
"For 2022 and 2021, reported pre-tax income was $31.0 billion and $34.0 billion, and reported provision (benefit) for credit losses was $2.5 billion and $(4.6) billion, resulting in pre-tax, pre-provision income of $33.5 billion and $29.4 billion."
"Thank you to our Team and our Directors Before I share more highlights of our results in 2022, I want to thank my Management Team and our Board of Directors for continuing to represent the needs of our clients, teammates, shareholders, and the communities we serve."
You will see more about these leaders on pages 12 and 13.
"I especially want to recognize Lead Independent Director Lionel Nowell, who was named as Independent Director of the Year by Corporate Board Member magazine."

We welcomed Jose (Joe) E.

"We thank Dave for his leadership, oversight, and prudent stewardship."
"Thank you as well to my 217,000 teammates who join me every day at our company to fulfll our purpose of making fnancial lives better."
"In a year that began with many of us once again working from home, we are pleased to have our teammates back together, collaborating in person to serve our clients and deliver the full breadth of our capabilities, as youll see highlighted throughout this Annual Report."
"A deeper look at 2022 In 2022, we earned $27.5 billion afer-tax, a decline from our record-level earnings in 2021, primarily due to increases in credit costs due to the absence of reserve releases."
"We earned $3.19 per diluted share, on $95 billion in revenue."
"Our pre-tax, pre-provision income, which adjusts for the provision expense, was up 14%* from 2021, driven by organic growth across our lines of business, higher interest rates, and prudent management of expenses."
This helped us achieve operating leverage in 2022.
Total assets declined slightly to $3.05 trillion driven by a decrease in deposits due to withdrawal of monetary accommodation.
These deposits remain at a healthy $1.9 trillion level.
"Deposits in the banking industry are shrinking, the natural and intended outcome of the Federal Reserves monetary actions to fght infation."
"At the same time, even as the economy weakened during 2022, loan demand increased as loans grew $67 billion to more than $1.04 trillion."
Asset quality remained strong as net charge-ofs remained near the historically low range experienced in 2021.
"Overall, our balance sheet continued to be supported by high levels of capital and liquidity, enabling us to continue to grow our business with customers, while meeting additional regulatory requirements, and repurchasing shares."
Rising infation also took its toll on the equities market.
"For the year, our stock price decreased 24%, directionally in line with the S&P 500 and the broader bank index."
This followed a strong 2021 performance that saw our stock outperform and increase 47%.
Book value per share and tangible book value per share both increased in 2022.
We also addressed increased regulatory changes in our capital requirements.
"Our common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) grew 5% in 2022 to more than $180 billion, and our CET1 ratio of 11.2% remained well above our new minimum requirements."
"Even while growing capital, our common dividend per share increased 10% from 2021 and, in the aggregate, in 2022 we returned $13.6 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases."
Our frst use of our capital generation is to grow our company by supporting our customers needs and pay our dividend.
"But in the end, we end up with more than we need for those purposes."
Share repurchases allow long-term holders to own more of our company.
"In addition, we continued investments to enhance being a Great Place to Work for teammates."
"We established a multi-faceted approach to workplace fexibility, provided free lunch for several months to help employees create informal connections and welcome them back fully to work, and continued our competitive pay packages to reward our employees for serving our clients and targeted our eforts at building long careers at Bank of America."
"For our communities and the broader needs of society, we also remain attentive to areas where we can direct the talent, innovation, and resources of our company and its role in capitalism."
"For example, we are working alongside our clients toward a clean energy, sustainable future."
This is also why we invest in partners and programs in our local markets: to help create economic opportunity and prosperity in underserved communities where the needs can be greatest.
"For all of this and more, Euromoney named Bank of America the Worlds Best Bank for the second time in fve years."

We once again delivered both profts and purposethe genius of the AND as we call itand we did it by delivering on the tenets of Responsible Growth.
"Throughout this letter, I will share with you examples about how we executed against each."
"The rest of this report discusses that work in greater detail, and we also make available a clear set of fnancial and non-fnancial disclosures so you can see for yourself how we measure our progress and determine where we have more work to do."
"We are capitalists at Bank of America At the core of the progress is our conviction that capitalism is embedded in how Responsible Growth delivers opportunity for our clients, our teammates, the communities we serve, and for you, our shareholders."
Ive sometimes been surprised to be asked including at Congressional hearingsAre you a capitalist?
"Your company is one of the most proftable companies in the world, whose purpose is to help our customers and clients live their fnancial lives, efectively helping them beneft in the capitalist system."
"Therefore, you might also fnd the question unusual."
"Of course, I answered, Yes."
But I understand the thoughts behind the question.
I think the questions and the concerns some may have about capitalism are about opportunity.
About whether companies are sharing profts or paying people fairly and equitably.
"At Bank of America, we look at it in this straightforward way: How can we rely on and help the innovation and energy of capitalism to address the priorities of our communities and society AND beneft our shareholders?"
"Capitalism provides the money, the creativity, and the expertise to solve the needs of society."
We enable our customers to drive capitalism.
It is what we do.

About all we do to support our teammates and be a Great Place to Work for them.
The many ways we partner in local markets to help support community priorities.
"And, at the same time, How we deliver for you, our shareholders."
"All these activities refect our view that capitalism creates opportunityfor our customers and clients at every stage of their progress; for our teammates to advance their careers at Bank of America and support their families; for those in our local communities who may need help accessing our economic system to achieve their own goals; and for our millions of investors, a chance to share in our success through their ownership."
"To do this, we align our day-to-day business activities to the work."
We bring our $3 trillion balance sheet to the task.
We bring our $273 billion in equity.
"We bring our capital markets and lending capabilities, raising trillions for our clients."
We bring the invested assets of our wealth management clients.
"Of course, we also bring the nearly $360 million of philanthropy we commit."

This aided in gathering $87 billion in client fo ws for company performance Delivering Responsible Growth in 2022 Lets look at how we executed against each of the four tenets of Responsible Growth in 2022.
"Grow and win in the market, no excuses."
"In 2022, we acquired new clients and deepened our relationships with existing ones."
"The strongest underlying evidence of winning in the marketplace is through market share, as illustrated by organic growth activity with our clients."
We drive Responsible Growth through our eight lines of business.
Our client teams deliver the unique capabilities and oferings of each business to each client.
We also focus in each market on bringing the entire company to every customer or client.
We track how well we deliver these integrated capabilities by the number of client referrals between our lines of business in our local markets.
"In 2022, we saw more than 7.5 million total referrals among our operating units."
I want to thank our 97 market presidents across the U.
S. and the nearly 30 country executives around the globe who serve as chief executive for Bank of America in their markets.
"They lead an integrated team to help us deliver one company for clients, teammates, you, our shareholders, and the broader communities served by your company."
"In this report on page 32, you will see how that comes to life in just one of these communities through our local leadership."
"In 2022, we saw more than 7.5 million total referrals among our operating units."
"In 2022, we helped consumer clients to open a record one million net new checking accounts."
"We also opened 465,000 Consumer Investment accounts through our online investment platform, Merrill Edge, resulting in $28 billion in net client fows."
And we added more than a million new consumer credit card accounts in three of the four quarters in 2022.
"Preferred Rewards our fagship loyalty program that recognizes and rewards clients for doing business with us across all productsrecorded another strong year of growth, with 10.2 million total clients enrolled."
"This represents a 9% year-over-year increase, with the program retaining its best-in-class 99% annualized membership retention rate."
"Small business owners benef ted from Bank of Americas products, scale and expertise at our retail f nancial centers across the U."
"S. including Business Advantage specialists in more than 2,600 f nancial centers, as well as our expansive ATM network, and access to local client professionals available to discuss their business priorities."
"We also are available to serve our small business clients digitally with the latest videoconferencing, chat and phone technology."
"Thanks to all of this and more, we continue to maintain our position among the nations largest small business lenders, ending 2022 with $36 billion in total outstanding loans under $1 million and a 5% increase in Small Business checking accounts."
And these small business clients have entrusted us with managing approximately $175 billion of deposits to pay their employees and build their businesses.
"Our Merchant Services platform also recorded a strong year supporting f nancial solutions for merchants, adding new clients and volume while achieving a #1 client experience rating from J."

And we saw average loan and lease growth of 10% year-over-yearthe 51st consecutive quarter of growth as we continue to deliver our full suite of products and services in a way that sets us apart from competitors and meets client needs.
"In our Global Banking business, serving commercial and corporate clients, we added more than 1,110 clients to the company in 2022 and grew average loans and leases 14% year-over-year to $375 billion."
"We also delivered $10.4 billion in Global Transaction Services revenue, up 38% over 2021."
We moved up to #3 in the investment banking fees market share worldwide.
Our Global Markets business once again had a very strong year despite market volatility.
"The team grew year-over-year sales and trading revenue by 9%, and had the highest full-year tally since 2010."
"This included investment in our macro trading business, which had revenues that were up 38% for the year."
Overall Global Markets average trading-related assets were up 9% and average loans of $117 billion increased 28%.
Responsible Growth means growing with a focus on the customerand that means that our products and services must evolve in line with our clients unique fnancial needs.
Grow with a customer focus.
Responsible Growth means growing with a focus on our customers and clients and that means that our products and services must evolve in line with our clients unique fnancial needs.
Consumer customers continue to tell us they value our digital capabilities.
"In 2022, your company: Added three million active digital banking users, improving upon a record performance in 2021 Had 56 million verifed users with 44 million active and engaged in the past 90 days Experienced 11.6 billion digital logins Grew digital sales 22%, representing nearly 50% of overall consumer sales Erica, our artifcial intelligence (AI)-based virtual fnancial assistant, also continues to attract increased client engagement as it has proven to be a critical channel to help us deliver important information to clients and address their questions and concerns in real-time."
Erica handled roughly 145 million interactions in the fourth quarter and recently passed a billion interactions since its introduction.
Among the most signifcant digital-driven changes in banking is how our clients want to send and receive money.
"In the fourth quarter of 2022, the number of consumer clients who are active Zelle users increased 15% to 18.2 million."
"These active users sent and received 273 million transfers worth $81 billion, up 25% and 24% year-over-year, respectively."
Zelle-sent transactions exceed checks written by our consumers.
This shows our customers preference for digital convenience.
"This allows us to see strong customer scores and loyalty, while reducing our costs of operation in our consumer business as a percentage of deposits to 117 basis points."
"Our wealth clients also expect digital innovation, and we are providing it."
"For example: In the fourth quarter of 2022, Erica interactions in the Merrill Wealth Management business increased 23% and Zelle transactions by Private Bank clients increased 39%."
Merrill clients are 82% digitally active while our Private Bank clients are now 86% digitally activenew highs for both.
"Digital check deposit rates for Merrill and Private Bank clients stand at 75% and 76%, respectively."
"Merrill now has 77% of households enrolled in eDelivery, with 223,000 planning reports generatedup 26% from the end of the previous year."
Merrill Lynch advisors sent 1.4 million secure messages to our clients in the fourth quarter of 2022 alone.
"Our commercial clients also continue to adopt our easy-to-use CashPro app, and along with that use, were seeing an increasing percentage of credit documents uploaded digitally, saving clients time."
"As of late 2022, 75% of clients are digitally active on the CashPro and BA360 platforms across commercial, corporate, and business banking."
"The fourth quarter of 2022 saw record quarterly CashPro App engagement, with active users increasing 25% and sign-ins increasing 50%, in turn driving a record 40% increase in quarterly CashPro App payment approvals with a value of $186 billion."
"We know we can increase these award-wining capabilities even more, driven by client demand."
56M 1 1.6B verifed digital digital logins users in 2022 in 2022 The case for continued development of our digital platforms is simple: clients tell us they clearly appreciate the value and convenience it providesso we will continue to provide and expand it.
We continue to take the steps necessary to fully digitally enable all products to drive growth and maximize the client experience.
"Thats why we invested $3.6 billion in 2022 for new technology initiatives, to build a powerful, more secure, and scalable technology platform with market-leading capabilities."
That sum is up from 2021 and is expected to be higher again in 2023.
And through continuous investment we have spent more than $30 billion over the past decade on new technology initiatives.
"BANK OF AMERICA 2022 | 7 company performance At the same time, we also continued to focus on delivering expert support and guidance across our high-touch physical network, opening 58 new fnancial centers, and renovating 784 more in 2022."
"We ended the year with 3,900 fnancial centers and 15,500 ATMs."
"This network also includes our phone, ofces, and chat capabilities."
"We are pleased by the results in our new markets, where we are growing from no fnancial centers there to become top 10 or above in deposit market share in just a few years."
"Together, our combined high-tech and high-touch approach to serving clients has led to record-high levels of customer satisfaction for Bank of America in 2022 and, in turn, contributed to our growth."
"Simply put, more satisfed clients do more business with us."
Another recent example of our customer-focus is the continued evolution of our overdraf services and solutions work that had been underway for more than a dozen years to reduce clients reliance on overdrafs and provide alternatives to help clients manage their deposit accounts and avoid fees.
You can see in our Retail Banking update on page 16 that these fees are down over 90% from 2009.
"We believe that these fees are not sustainable for a good customer relationship, and by eliminating them we are able to increase satisfaction and deepen relationships to create a more stable source of revenues, while reducing costs for our company."
"Continued quarterly operating lev erage streak in 2022 29% 22% 21% 8% 8% 8% 6% 6% 5% 4% 3% 3% 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q 15 16 17 This work beneftted from the important insights and guidance from our National Community Advisory Council (NCAC), a group of external advisors, analysts, and consumer advocates that we established 17 years ago."
"The NCAC provides important external perspective to help us understand, design, and deliver products to help meet the needs of our communitiesparticularly those in the low- to moderate-income sphere."
Grow within our risk framework.
The third tenet of Responsible Growth is to grow within our well-managed risk framework a framework that allowed us to be a source of strength to clients during the health crisis and that has continued to allow us to grow during the current volatile market environment.
"Our discipline around risk has us well-prepared for a severe economic stress scenario, as illustrated by Bank of America having the lowest stressed credit loss rates among major banks in nine out of the past 10 CCAR exams conducted by the Federal Reserve Board."
"As we cited earlier, credit quality continues to be better than 2019, which was the last year before the pandemic and represented a very strong year for credit at banks."
"In addition to being efective, our risk management is also agilewhen regulatory capital ratio requirements for banks changed with little advance notice in 2022, we made moves so that we had a bufer to those requirements quickly."
"Importantly, we did that as we continued to support clients, return capital to shareholders, and strengthen our strong balance sheet."

"1 Operating leverage is calculated as the year-over-year percentage change in revenue, net of interest expense, less the percentage change in noninterest expense."
8 | BANK OF AMERICA 2022 Grow in a sustainable manner.
Responsible Growth requires us to grow in a sustainable manner.
This has three components.
"First, we drive Operational Excellence (OpEx)."
"This allows us to create savings, which we can then reinvestin our capabilities, our teammates, our communities and in capital returns to shareholders."
"Second, we want to be a Great Place to Work for our teammates."
This provides us a competitive edge to attract the best new teammates to serve our clients and retain them once theyve joined the team.
"Third, we share our success so we can support the communities in which we work and live and help to address the biggest challenges facing communities today."
Driving Operational Excellence.
"OpEx is how we create the means to reduce costs by striving to eliminate inefciencies in our processes across our platform and reinvest savings into the things that are important to us: our team, our capabilities, our client experience, our communities, and our shareholders."
"By pursuing OpEx, we drive continuous improvement, reduce risk, and identify faster, simpler, and more efcient ways of working and serving our clients."
"In 2022, our fourth quarter operating leverage was 6%."
"Simply put, operating leverage is the percentage growth in revenue minus the percent growth in expenses."
"By looking for continuous process improvements and savings through OpEx, we have delivered operating leverage for the past six consecutive quarterspicking back up on the 18-quarter streak we had developed prior to the pandemic-driven economic slowdown."
"In Retail Banking, OpEx and a more digitized customer base helped pay for investments that allowed us to improve that businesss efciency ratio to 47% in the most recent quarter, an impressive 600 basis point improvement over the year-ago fourth quarter."
"Across the company, we have implemented more than 12,000 employee-sourced suggestions since 2014 to simplify our work and create greater efciency."
"In addition to making it easier to serve our clients, these ideas have resulted in nearly $5 billion in expense savings and 13 million hours of capacity saved."
"Whatever challenges the future may hold, your companys focus on OpEx will help deliver for clients while investing in the future of our people, communities and driving great returns to you, our shareholders."
"In 2022, our expenses were $61 billion, which is more than $10 billion lower than a decade ago."
Central to driving Responsible Growth is being a Great Place to Work for our teammates.
"In 2022, we continued this long-standing commitment."
Making our company a Great Place to Work.
Central to driving Responsible Growth is being a Great Place to Work for our teammates.
"In 2022, we continued this long-standing commitment, including delivering a range of some of the best benefts in corporate America, supporting the development of our employees, and maintaining a workplace where every individual can thrive."
Our goal continues to be a company where people want to work today and build a career.

"When our communities fare well, we fare well, and our brand refects it."
"In 2022, we made nearly $360 million in philanthropic investments to strengthen our communities."
"Our teammates also donated money, as well as their time, to share success."
"Charitable giving by our teammates in 2022, combined with matching gifs from Bank of America, totaled more than $65 million."
Our teammates also reported nearly two million volunteer hours for the year.
I am proud to share this proof of their commitment to our communities with you.
"To help support health and safety, and address food insecurity in our local markets, we ran two campaigns to encourage employees to get vaccinated and/or boosted against COVID-19 and the fu, donating to hunger relief organizations for each employee who took those actions."
"Combined, the campaigns donated more than $18 million for hunger organizations across the country."
Since 2015 we have donated nearly $184 million toward hunger relief eforts.
We also create opportunity in our communities through employment.
"We are in our second commitment to hire 10,000 teammates from low- and moderate-income communities, having completed the frst in three years versus the fve pledged."

Measuring our positive impact at home and around the world how capitalism delivers I was asked by a teammate with a college-age daughter how we might be more convincing that capitalism is doing what society wants from it.
"My response: We dont leave it to interpretation, we disclose what we do for all to see."
What we show in the metrics in this report is the progress we are making as well as the alignment to what society wants from capitalismto produce profts and purpose.
That perpetual motion machine of capitalism can continuously invest in progress on the goals described below.
"Charity is wonderful, but it doesnt provide enough money."
"Governments are large spenders, but they are short on cash and run huge defcits, so they really dont have the money to drive sustained progress."
Government policies shif and therefore long-term change is hard to achieve.
"Companies around the world, when aligned to the tasks generate activity that dwarfs the eforts of other sectors."
"It is sustained by the profts, which draw more capital."
"So the straightforward answer to the teammate was if we want to be successful at what society wants, we should all cheer capitalism on."
"However, it is important to measure progress to prove capitalism is working."
In the U.
"S. and globally, companies can track their performance in areas that include equality of opportunity, afordable housing, prosperity, access to clean water, sustainable, clean, secure energy, and other priorities."
We do so through reporting a set of universal Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics (SCM).
"The SCMs span the breadth of global industry, giving a consistent framework to measure and disclose how companies are addressing societal priorities and the SDGs through their business activities and operations."
Nearly 200 companies around the world have committed to reporting SCMs and about 140 have already begun to do so.
The metrics were developed with the expertise of the global Big Four accounting frms.
You can fnd our 2022 Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics on page 60.
"This is the third consecutive year we have published these metrics in our Annual Report, in addition to our fnancial disclosures."
"We believe this provides the most relevant, useful and transparent information."
"This disclosure is comprehensive and straightforward, allowing you, our shareholders, to assess your company."
"Many observers express diferent views on disclosures; for example, there are multiple shareholder proposals in our proxy statement, each Letter from our expressing diferent views on what is the right disclosure or action."
We encourage you to review our SCMs and all the other disclosures we reference in this Annual Report and proxy statement.
We dont need to spend more of your money on inconsistent and redundant standards; we need to keep driving our performance.
The last year has underscored once again that change is constant in our world.
A successful company must be able to operate in any environment.

"Building on our history of climate leadership, we are working towards 2030 targets for our operations and supply chain."
"Our Net Zero before 2050 goal includes operations, supply chain and financing activities (i.e., Scope 1, Scope 2 and material Scope 3)."
"As a next step in our path to achieve Net Zero, we published our Approach to Zero strategy in 2022, outlining our 2030 science-aligned targets for reducing emissions associated with financing activities for three key sectors: Auto Manufacturing, Energy and Power Generation."
These targets were set using the International Energy Agencys Net Zero 2050 1.5 aligned scenario.

"Evaluation of environmental matters may include land and water use impacts, a remediation/reclamation track record (if applicable), climate risk reporting, community and stakeholder engagement and overall transparency."
"For acute physical risk, which are event-driven extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes, or floods, the Corporation follows Federal flood insurance regulations and the industrys mortgage hazard insurance (including fire/wind coverage) during underwriting."
Flood insurance requirements are based on flood zones determined by FEMA.
Insurance coverage amounts require replacement value of property with policy parameters following industry standards for minimum/maximum.

Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
"LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates After December 31, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) ceased publishing British Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen (JPY) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings and one-week and two-month U."
"S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings, subject to the continued publication of certain non-representative LIBOR settings based on a modified calculation (i.e., on a synthetic basis)."
"The remaining USD LIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six month and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023, although the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued a consultation seeking views on whether to compel publication of the one-month, three-month and six-month USD LIBOR settings on a synthetic basis for a short time after June 30, 2023 (i.e., through September 30, 2024)."
"Separately, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued supervisory guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021, subject to certain regulatory-approved exceptions (USD LIBOR Guidance)."
"As a result, a major transition has been and continues to be in progress in the global financial markets with respect to the replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs)."
This has been and continues to be a complex process impacting a variety of our businesses and operations.
"IBORs have historically been used in many of the Corporations products and contracts, including derivatives, consumer and commercial loans, mortgages, floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate products and financial instruments."
"In response, the Corporation established an enterprise-wide IBOR transition program, with active involvement of senior management and regular reports to the Management Risk Committee (MRC) and Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC)."
"The program continues to drive the Corporation's industry and regulatory engagement, client and financial contract changes, internal and external communications, technology and operations modifications, including updates to its operational models, systems and processes, introduction of new products, migration of existing clients, and program strategy and governance."
"As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation transitioned or otherwise addressed IBOR-based products and contracts referencing the rates that ceased or became non-representative after December 31, 2021, including LIBOR-linked commercial loans, LIBOR-based adjustable-rate consumer mortgages, LIBOR-linked derivatives and interdealer trading of certain USD LIBOR and other interest rate swaps, and related hedging arrangements."
"Additionally, in accordance with the USD LIBOR Guidance, the Corporation has ceased entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate, subject to limited exceptions, including those consistent with supervisory guidance."
The Corporation launched capabilities and services to support the issuance of and trading in products indexed to various alternative reference rates (ARRs) and developed employee training programs as well as other internal and external sources of information on the various challenges and opportunities that the replacement of IBORs has presented and continues to present.
"The Corporation continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by 74 Bank of America 2022 individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to meet regulatory and industry- wide recommended milestones, and access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR products."
"With respect to the transition of LIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR settings ceasing or becoming non-representative as of June 30, 2023, a significant majority of the Corporations notional contractual exposure to such LIBOR settings, of which the significant majority is derivatives contracts, have been remediated (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to ARRs based on market-driven protocols, regulatory guidance and industry-recommended fallback provisions and related mechanisms), and the Corporation is continuing to remediate the remaining USD LIBOR exposure."
"For example, during the first half of 2023, certain central counterparties (CCPs) expect to complete processes to convert outstanding USD LIBOR- cleared derivatives to ARR positions."
"The remaining exposure, a majority of which is made up of derivatives and commercial loans and which represents a small minority of outstanding USD LIBOR notional contractual exposure of the Corporation, requires active dialogue with clients to modify the contracts."
"For any residual exposures after June 2023 that continue to have no fallback provisions, the Corporation continues to assess and plans to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, including the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act in the U."
"S. (as implemented by the Federal Reserve) and synthetic USD LIBOR (if the FCA compels such publication), to transition such exposure."
While there remain risks to the Corporation associated with the transition from IBORs (as discussed under Item 1A.
"Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K), such risks have been monitored and, where applicable, managed through the Corporations efforts and dedicated operational resources to date."
"In the Corporations view, the potential likelihood and/or impact of transition-related risks has lessened over time, and the Corporation anticipates it has devoted appropriate resources to remaining transition efforts and will be able to continue to appropriately monitor and manage such risks as the transition process continues."
"The Corporation expects transition-related risks to further diminish as certain market developments occur prior to June 30, 2023."
"The Corporation has implemented regulatory, tax and accounting changes and continues to monitor current and potential impacts of the transition, including Internal Revenue Service tax regulations and guidance and Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance."
"In addition, the Corporation has engaged impacted clients in connection with the transition by providing education on ARRs and the timing of transition events."
"The Corporation is also working actively with global regulators, industry working groups and trade associations."
"For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Item 1A."

"For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 132."
"Net income was $27.5 billion, or $3.19 per diluted share in 2022 compared to $32.0 billion, or $3.57 per diluted share in 2021."
"The decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses, lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income."
"For discussion and analysis of our consolidated and business segment results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020, see Financial Highlights and Business Segment Operations sections in the MD&A of the Corporations 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K."
Net Interest Income Net interest income increased $9.5 billion to $52.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021.
Net interest yield on a fully taxable- equivalent (FTE) basis increased 30 basis points (bps) to 1.96 percent for 2022.
"The increase was primarily driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization expense, and loan growth, partially offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in 2021."
"For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 79, and for Bank of America 2022 75 more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 126."
"Noninterest Income Table 2 Noninterest Income (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 6,083 $ 6,218 Service charges 6,405 7,504 Investment and brokerage services 15,901 16,690 Investment banking fees 4,823 8,887 Total fees and commissions 33,212 39,299 Market making and similar activities 12,075 8,691 Other income (2,799) (1,811) Total noninterest income $ 42,488 $ 46,179 Noninterest income decreased $3.7 billion to $42.5 billion for 2022 compared to 2021."
The following highlights the significant changes.
Service charges decreased $1.1 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes as well as lower treasury service charges.
"Investment and brokerage services decreased $789 million primarily driven by lower market valuations and declines in assets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by positive AUM flows."
Investment banking fees decreased $4.1 billion primarily driven by a decline in demand resulting in lower equity and debt issuance fees and lower advisory fees.
"Market making and similar activities increased $3.4 billion primarily driven by improved performance across macro products in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and by the impact of higher interest rates on client financing activities in Equities."
Other income decreased $988 million primarily due to certain valuation adjustments.
Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $7.1 billion to $2.5 billion for 2022 compared to 2021.
"The provision for credit losses for 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced COVID-19 pandemic (the pandemic) uncertainties."
"For the same period in the prior year, the benefit in the provision for credit losses was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook."
"For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 120."
"Noninterest Expense Table 3 Noninterest Expense (Dollars in millions) Compensation and benefits Occupancy and equipment Information processing and communications Product delivery and transaction related Marketing Professional fees Other general operating Total noninterest expense $ $ 2022 36,447 7,071 6,279 3,653 1,825 2,142 4,021 61,438 $ $ 2021 36,140 7,138 5,769 3,881 1,939 1,775 3,089 59,731 Noninterest expense increased $1.7 billion to $61.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021."
"The increase was primarily due to higher investments in people and technology, expense associated with the settlement of the legacy monoline insurance litigation and expense related to certain regulatory matters, partially offset by lower net COVID-19 related costs."
"Income Tax Expense Table 4 Income Tax Expense (Dollars in millions) Income before income taxes Income tax expense Effective tax rate $ 2022 30,969 3,441 11.1 % $ 2021 33,976 1,998 5.9 % Income tax expense was $3.4 billion for 2022 compared to $2.0 billion in 2021 resulting in an effective tax rate of 11.1 percent compared to 5.9 percent."
The effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were primarily driven by our recurring preference benefits.
Also included in the effective tax rate for 2021 was the impact of the 2021 U.
K. tax law change further discussed in this section.
"For more information on our recurring tax preference benefits, see Note 19 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Absent environmental, social and governance (ESG) tax credits and discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rates would have been approximately 25 percent."
"On August 16, 2022, the U."
"S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related provisions, including the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs."
"In particular, partnerships are no longer solely limited to an Investment Tax Credit, but can now also elect a Production Tax Credit for solar energy production facilities placed in service after December 31, 2021."
"Other notable tax law changes include the establishment of a new 15 percent AMT on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on net stock repurchases, both of which were effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023."
"The tax law changes for the new AMT permit business credits, including those from ESG investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, to offset potential AMT liability."
The Corporation has assessed the potential impacts of these two U.
S. tax law changes and does not expect the changes to have a significant effect on its future effective tax rate.
"On June 10, 2021, the U."
"K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which increased the U."
K. corporation income tax rate to 25 percent from 19 percent.
"This change is effective April 1, 2023 and unfavorably affects income tax expense on future U."
K. earnings.
"As a result, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Corporation recorded a positive income tax adjustment of approximately $2.0 billion with a corresponding write-up of U."
"K. net deferred tax assets, which reflected a reversal of previously recorded write-downs of net deferred tax assets for prior changes in the U."
K. corporation income tax rate.

Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased $118.0 billion primarily driven by lower deposits and continued loan growth .
Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell Federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis.
"Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized lending transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities for settlement and for collateral."
Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell increased $16.9 billion primarily due to client activity within Global Markets .
Trading Account Assets Trading account assets consist primarily of long positions in equity and fixed-income securities including U.
"S. government and agency securities, corporate securities and non-U."
S. sovereign debt.
Trading account assets increased $49.0 billion primarily due to client activity within Global Markets .
Debt Securities Debt securities primarily include U.
"S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency MBS, non-U."
"S. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt."
We use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to leverage market conditions that create economically attractive returns on these investments.
Debt securities decreased $119.8 billion primarily driven by lower deposits and continued loan growth.
"For more information on debt securities, see Note 4 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Bank of America 2022 77 Loans and Leases Loans and leases increased $66.6 billion primarily driven by growth in commercial loans, higher credit card spending and higher residential mortgages due to lower paydowns and continued originations."
"For more information on the loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 106."
"Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $295 million primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties."
"For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 120."
All Other Assets All other assets decreased $12.5 billion primarily driven by a decline in margin loans and loans held-for-sale (LHFS).
"Liabilities At December 31, 2022, total liabilities were approximately $2.8 trillion, down $121.3 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower deposits."
Deposits Deposits decreased $134.1 billion primarily due to an increase in customer spending and a shift to higher yielding accounts.
Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase Federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis.
"Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet."
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase increased $3.3 billion primarily driven by an increase in repurchase agreements to support liquidity.
Trading Account Liabilities Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity and fixed-income securities including U.
"S. Treasury and agency securities, non-U."
S. sovereign debt and corporate securities.
Trading account liabilities decreased $20.3 billion primarily due to lower levels of short positions within Global Markets .
"Short-term Borrowings Short-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings, notes payable and various other borrowings that generally have maturities of one year or less."
Short-term borrowings increased $3.2 billion primarily due to an increase in FHLB advances and commercial paper to manage liquidity needs.
"For more information on short-term borrowings, see Note 10 Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Long-term Debt Long-term debt decreased $4.1 billion primarily due to maturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments, partially offset by issuances."
"For more information on long-term debt, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
All Other Liabilities All other liabilities increased $30.8 billion primarily driven by Global Markets client activity.
"Shareholders Equity Shareholders equity increased $3.1 billion primarily due to net income and the issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities, and returns of capital to shareholders through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases."
Cash Flows Overview The Corporations operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending activities.
"We believe that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs."
Our investing activities primarily include the debt securities portfolio and loans and leases.
"Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily related to customer deposits, securities financing agreements, long-term debt and common and preferred stock."
"For more information on liquidity, see Liquidity Risk on page 101."
"78 Bank of America 2022 Supplemental Financial Data Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this Form 10-K, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures."
Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
"Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements."
These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
"We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures."
"To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense."
"For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate."
"Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis."
We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.
"We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures."
We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.
"We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure."
"Tangible equity represents shareholders equity or common shareholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity)."
These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity.
"In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives."
These ratios are: Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders equity.
The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets.
Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity.
The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets.
Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.
We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.
Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.
The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.
"For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 132."
Key Performance Indicators We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results.
We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends.
These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies.
"For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 214."
"Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 75, Table 6 on page 80 and Table 7 on page 81."
"For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 84."

"Bank of America 2022 83 Business Segment Operations Segment Description and Basis of Presentation We report our results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other ."
We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis.
"The primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and All Other are shown below."
We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes.
We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models.
"Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segments credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components."
"For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 93."
The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital.
Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit.
"For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 79, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and year-end total assets, see Note 23 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
Key Performance Indicators We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results.
"We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments operational performance, customer trends and business growth."

"Consumer Banking Results Net income for Consumer Banking increased $625 million to $12.5 billion due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense."
"Net interest income increased $5.1 billion to $30.0 billion primarily driven by higher interest rates and the benefits of higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in 2021."
"Noninterest income decreased $486 million to $8.6 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, partially offset by a gain on the sale of an affinity card loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022."
"The provision for credit losses increased $3.0 billion to $2.0 billion primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook in 2022, compared to a benefit in 2021 due to an improved macroeconomic outlook."
"Noninterest expense increased $787 million to $20.1 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth, including marketing, technology and people, as well as increased client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization and the contribution to the Bank of America Foundation in the prior year."
"The return on average allocated capital was 31 percent, unchanged from 2021."
"For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 84."
Deposits Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities that consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses.
"Our deposit products include noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, money market savings accounts, traditional savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, as well as investment accounts and products."
Net interest income is allocated to deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics.
"Deposits generates fees such as account service fees and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Consumer Investment accounts."
"Consumer Investments serves investment client relationships through the Merrill Edge integrated investing and banking service platform, providing investment advice and guidance, client brokerage asset services, self-directed online investing and key banking capabilities including access to the Bank of America 2022 85 Corporations network of financial centers and ATMs."
"Net income for Deposits increased $2.4 billion to $7.1 billion due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and an increase in provision for credit losses."
Net interest income increased $4.9 billion to $19.3 billion primarily due to higher interest rates and the benefit of higher deposit balances.
"Noninterest income decreased $585 million to $3.1 billion primarily driven by the impact of non- sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, partially offset by higher other service charges due to increased client activity."
The provision for credit losses increased $324 million to $564 million primarily driven by increased overdraft losses due to higher payment activity related to checking accounts.
The benefit in the prior year was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.
"Noninterest expense increased $743 million to $12.4 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization in the prior year."
Average deposits increased $80.7 billion to $1.1 trillion primarily due to net inflows of $46.8 billion in checking and $34.9 billion in money market savings largely driven by strong organic growth.

"Consumer Lending products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels."
"Consumer Lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans, including loans held on the balance sheet of Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others."
Net income for Consumer Lending decreased $1.8 billion to $5.4 billion primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses.
"Net interest income increased $220 million to $10.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates and loan balances, largely offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in 2021."
Noninterest income increased $99 million to $5.4 billion primarily driven by a gain on the sale of an affinity card loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022.
The provision for credit losses increased $2.7 billion to $1.4 billion primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic environment in 2022 compared to a benefit in 2021 due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.
"Noninterest expense increased $44 million to $7.7 billion largely driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity, partially offset by the contribution to the Bank of America Foundation in the prior year."
"Average loans increased $8.6 billion to $288.2 billion primarily driven by an increase in credit card loans and first mortgage loans, partially offset by a decline in PPP loans."

"Sales and trading revenue increased $1.3 billion, and excluding net DVA, sales and trading revenue increased $1.2 billion."
These increases were driven by higher revenue in both FICC and Equities.
Noninterest expense decreased $612 million to $12.4 billion primarily driven by the realignment of a liquidating business activity from Global Markets to All Other in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an acceleration of expenses from incentive compensation award changes in the prior year.
Average total assets increased $71.6 billion to $857.6 billion driven by loan growth and commodities activity in FICC.

Managing Risk Risk is inherent in all our business activities.
Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders.
"If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies."
"We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the ERC and the Board."
"The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational."
"Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate."
Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.
Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings.
Market risk is composed of price risk and interest rate risk.
Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions.
"Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures."
"Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people or external events."
Reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.
"The following sections address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk."
"This discussion of managing risk focuses on the current Risk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was approved by the ERC and the Board."
"As set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose, and how we drive Responsible Growth."
It requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within our risk appetite.
Sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to the success of the Corporation and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the Board.
Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation.
"The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities."
"Executive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each business."
"Management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and recommends them annually to the Board for approval."
"Our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite."
Management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business.
Capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve.
"For more information regarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 84."
"The Corporations risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements."
Our risk appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to assist senior management and the Board in assessing the Corporations risk profile against our risk appetite and risk capacity.
"Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits."
"Our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities."
"Therefore, we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner at all times, including during periods of stress."
Our lines of business operate with risk limits that align with the Corporations risk appetite.
Senior management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to risk appetite limits.
"The Board, and its committees when appropriate, oversee financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls."
"For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 96 through 129."
Risk Management Governance The Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby the Board and its committees may delegate authority to management-level committees or executive officers.
"Such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval functions, which may be evidenced in documents such as committee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions."
"The chart below illustrates the interrelationship among the Board, Board committees and management committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the Corporation."
"Bank of America 2022 93 Board of Directors and Board Committees The Board is composed of 15 directors, all but one of whom are independent."
The Board authorizes management to maintain an effective Risk Framework and oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices.
"In addition, the Board or its committees conduct inquiries of, and receive reports from senior management on, risk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of Global Risk Management (GRM) and/or Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities."
The Board committees discussed below have the principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our risk management activities.
"Through these activities, the Board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk profile and oversee senior management addressing key risks we face."
"Other Board committees, as described below, provide additional oversight of specific risks."
"Each of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports to the Board on risk-related matters within the committees responsibilities, which is intended to collectively provide the Board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks."
"Audit Committee The Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance and independence of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, the performance of our corporate audit function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and makes inquiries of senior management or the Chief Audit Executive (CAE) to determine whether there are scope or resource limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities."
The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing compliance risks pursuant to the New York Stock Exchange listing standards.
"Enterprise Risk Committee The ERC oversees the Corporations Risk Framework, risk appetite and senior managements responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks facing the Corporation."
The ERC may consult with other Board committees on risk-related matters.
"Other Board Committees Our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee oversees our Boards governance processes, identifies and reviews the qualifications of potential Board members, leads Board and committee succession planning and their formal self- evaluation, and reviews our ESG activities, shareholder input and shareholder engagement process."
"Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees establishing, maintaining and administering our compensation programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and recommending our Chief Executive Officers (CEO) compensation to our Board for further approval by all independent directors; reviewing and approving our executive officers compensation, as well as compensation for non-management directors; and reviewing certain other human capital management topics, including pay equity and diversity and inclusion."
"Management Committees Management committees receive their authority from the Board, a Board committee, or another management committee."
Our primary management risk committee is the MRC.
"Subject to Board oversight, the MRC is responsible for management oversight of key risks facing the Corporation, including an integrated evaluation of risk, earnings, capital and liquidity."
"Lines of Defense We have clear ownership and accountability for managing risk across three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs), GRM and Corporate Audit."
"We also have control functions outside of FLUs and GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources)."
The three lines of defense are integrated into our management-level governance structure.
Each of these functional roles is further described in this section.
Executive Officers Executive officers lead various functions representing the functional roles.
"Authority for functional roles may be delegated to executive officers from the Board, Board committees or management-level committees."
"Executive officers, in turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level committees, management routines or individuals."
"Executive officers review our activities for consistency with our Risk Framework, risk appetite, and applicable strategic, capital and financial operating plans, as well as applicable policies and standards."
"Executive officers and other employees make decisions individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated."
Executive officers and other employees may also serve on committees and participate in committee decisions.

"Human Capital Committees I Committee and Sustainability Committee I Committee I I I I Manageme nt Disclosure Management Risk Regulation 0 Respons ible Growth Corporate Benefits Management Committees Committee 11> Committee Committee Committee Committee Compensat ion Committee '"" Reports to the CEO and CFO with oversight by the Audit Committee Front Line Units FLUs, which include the lines of business as well as Global Technology and Global Operations, are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities."
"Three organizational units that include FLU activities and control function activities, but are not part of GRM are first, the Chief Financial Officer Group; second, the Chief Administrative Officer Group; and third, Global Strategy and Enterprise Platforms."
Global Risk Management GRM is part of our control functions and operates as our independent risk management function.
"GRM, led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risks within FLUs and other control functions."
"GRM establishes written enterprise policies and procedures outlining how aggregate risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled."
"The CRO has the stature, authority and independence needed to develop and implement a meaningful risk management framework and practices to guide the Corporation in managing risk."
The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports directly to both the ERC and the CEO.
GRM is organized into horizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical CRO teams that cover a particular FLU or control function.
These teams work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.
"Corporate Audit Corporate Audit and the CAE maintain their independence from the FLUs, GRM and other control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee."
The CAE administratively reports to the CEO.
Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation.
"Corporate Audit includes Credit Review, which provides an independent assessment of credit lending decisions and the effectiveness of credit processes across the Corporations credit platform through examinations and monitoring."
"Risk Management Processes The Risk Framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated in key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and in day-to-day business processes across the Corporation, thereby ensuring risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner."
"We employ an effective risk management process, referred to as Identify, Measure, Monitor and Control, as part of our daily activities."
"Identify To be effectively managed, risks must be proactively identified and well understood."
Proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors.
Each employee is expected to identify and escalate risks promptly.
Risk identification is an ongoing process that incorporates input from FLUs and control functions.
It is designed to be forward-looking and to capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business.
"Measure Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic process including qualitative statements and quantitative limits."
"Risk is measured at various levels, including, but not limited to, risk type, FLU and legal entity, and also on an aggregate basis."
"This risk measurement process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction, concentrations, portfolio quality and the overall economic environment."
Senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios.
"Monitor We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite, policies and standards."
We also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures.
"Through our monitoring, we know our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner."
We also know when risk limits are breached and have processes to appropriately report and escalate exceptions.
"This includes timely requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management, management-level committees or the Board (directly or through an appropriate committee)."
"Control We establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies, standards, procedures and processes."
The limits and controls can be adjusted by senior management or the Board when conditions or risk tolerances warrant.
"These limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading volume, operational loss) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk categories)."
Our FLUs are held accountable for performing within the established limits.
The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process.
"We instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational roles and responsibilities."
Establishing a culture reflective of our purpose to help make our customers financial lives better and delivering on Responsible Growth is also critical to effective risk management.
We are committed to the highest principles of ethical and professional conduct.
"Conduct risk is the risk of improper actions, behaviors or practices by the Corporation, its employees or representatives that are illegal, unethical and/or contrary to our core values that could result in harm to the Corporation, our shareholders or our customers, damage the integrity of the financial markets, or negatively impact our reputation."
We have established protocols and structures so that conduct risk is governed and reported across the Corporation appropriately.
"All employees are held accountable for adhering to the Code of Conduct, operating within our risk appetite and managing risk in their daily business activities."
"In addition, our performance management and compensation practices encourage responsible risk-taking that is consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite."
"Corporation-wide Stress Testing Integral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic Planning processes, we conduct capital scenario management and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated."
"These stress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices."
"The intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and certain subsidiaries and how they impact financial resiliency, which provides confidence to management, regulators and our investors."
"Contingency Planning We have developed and maintain contingency plans that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of Bank of America 2022 95 potential adverse economic, financial or market stress."
"These contingency plans include our Capital Contingency Plan and Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options that include asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, and other de- risking strategies."
We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of Bank of America.
"Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks."
"This risk results from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate, such as competitor actions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence and technology developments."
An aspect of strategic risk is the risk that the Corporations capital levels are not adequate to meet minimum regulatory requirements and support execution of business activities or absorb losses from risks during normal or adverse economic and market conditions.
"As such, capital risk is managed in parallel to strategic risk."
"We manage strategic risk through the Strategic Risk Enterprise Policy and integration into the strategic planning process, among other activities."
"Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks impacting each business."
"On an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk Appetite Statement."
"With oversight by the Board, senior management directs the lines of business to execute our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite."
"The executive management team monitors business performance throughout the year and provides the Board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented."
"The regular executive reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the strategic plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis."
"Significant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by the Board."
"At the business level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where required."
"With oversight by the Board and the ERC, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength."
"Proprietary models are used to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks."
The allocated capital assigned to each business 96 Bank of America 2022 is based on its unique risk profile.
"With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans."
"The businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies, and price products and transactions."
"Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning."
"Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements."
"Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits."
We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis.
"The ICAAP is a forward- looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions."
"We utilize periodic stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios."
We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests.
We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements.
Management assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees.
We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes.
"For more information, see Business Segment Operations on page 84."
"CCAR and Capital Planning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan."
"Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, our stress capital buffer (SCB) increased to 3.4 percent from 2.5 percent, effective October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023."
"In October 2021, the Board authorized the Corporations $25 billion common stock repurchase program."
"Additionally, the Board authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporations equity-based compensation plans."
"Pursuant to the Boards authorizations, during 2022, we repurchased $5.1 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans."
"The timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporations capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time."
"Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)."
"Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U."
S. banking regulators.
"Basel 3 established minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements and outlined two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches."
"The Standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models."
The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.
"The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches."
"The lower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements are used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework."
"As of December 31, 2022, the common equity tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios."
"Minimum Capital Requirements In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk- based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge."
The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital.
"For the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, the Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement was 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches."
"Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, the Corporations SCB increased to 3.4 percent, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement of 10.4 percent under the Standardized approach for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023."
Our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement under the Advanced approaches remains unchanged at 9.5 percent.
The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges.
Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committees assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance.
"Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporations reliance on short-term wholesale funding."
"The Corporations G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent from 2.5 percent on January 1, 2024, which will increase our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement."
"At December 31, 2022, the Corporations CET1 capital ratio of 11.2 percent under the Standardized approach exceeded its current CET1 capital ratio requirement as well as the minimum requirement expected to be in place as of January 1, 2024 due to an anticipated increase in our G-SIB surcharge."
The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.
The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital.
"The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted deductions, and applicable temporary exclusions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter."
"Capital Composition and Ratios Table 10 presents Bank of America Corporations capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements."

"(2) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"The Corporation's SCB applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach was 3.4 percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2021."
The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero.
"The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and our capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent or the SCB, as applicable, of 3.4 percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2021."
The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.

"To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks."
"These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market fluctuation from the rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic environment."
"We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise."
"We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current Bank of America 2022 101 (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions."
"We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events."
The Board approves our liquidity risk policy and the Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan.
The ERC establishes our liquidity risk tolerance levels.
The MRC is responsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures within the established tolerance levels.
"The MRC reviews and monitors our liquidity position and stress testing results, approves certain liquidity risk limits and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity."
"For more information, see Managing Risk on page 93."
"Under this governance framework, we developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining liquidity at Bank of America Corporation (Parent) and selected subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning."
"NB Holdings Corporation The Parent, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings)."
"We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional Parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings."
"The Parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets."
"These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the Parent would be resolved under the U."
S. Bankruptcy Code.
"In consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings issued a subordinated note to the Parent in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets."
The aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers.
NB Holdings also provided the Parent with a committed line of credit that allows the Parent to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash needs.
"These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the Parent would be resolved under the U."
S. Bankruptcy Code.
"These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the Parent to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the Parent becomes imminent."
"Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the Parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high- quality, liquid, unencumbered securities."
"Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the Parent and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions."
"Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U."
"S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U."
"S. government securities, U."
"S. agency securities, U."
"S. agency MBS and other investment-grade securities, and a select group of non-U."
S. government securities.
"We can obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales."
"We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities."
"Table 15 presents average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"Table 15 Average Global Liquidity Sources Three Months Ended December 31 (Dollars in billions) 2022 2021 Bank entities $ 694 $ 1,006 Nonbank and other entities (1) 174 152 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 868 $ 1,158 (1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities."
"Our bank subsidiaries liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity."
Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window.
"The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $348 billion and $322 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral."
Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion.
"Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the Parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval."
"Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities."
"The Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities."
"Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the Parent or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements."
Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.
"Table 16 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021."

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules.
"However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries."
"The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institutions unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage."
"Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $605 billion and $617 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 120 percent and 115 percent."
Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.
Liquidity Stress Analysis We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios.
"The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the Parent and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios."
"The scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events."
"The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities."
"Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results."
We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity.
We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.
Net Stable Funding Ratio The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period.
"The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks."
The U.
S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions.
"At December 31, 2022, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with this requirement."
"Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups."
"The primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries."
"Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make Parent funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt."
"We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.93 trillion and $2.1 trillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments."
"These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U."
S. deposits are insured by the FDIC.
"We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding."
"We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources."
"Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans."
"Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions."
We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing.
Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight.
Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing.
"We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate."
"For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 10 Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Total long-term debt decreased $4.1 billion to $276.0 billion during 2022 primarily due to debt maturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments, partially offset by debt issuances."
"We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors."
Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors.
"During 2022, we issued $66.0 billion of long-term debt consisting of $44.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant, Bank of America 2022 103 $10.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N."
A.
and $11.8 billion of other debt.
"During 2021, we issued $76.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $56.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant, $8 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N."
A.
and $12.5 billion of other debt.
"During 2022, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $33.3 billion consisting of $19.8 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $9.9 billion for Bank of America, N."
A.
and $3.6 billion of other debt.
"During 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $46.4 billion consisting of $24.4 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $10.4 billion for Bank of America, N."
A.
and $11.6 billion of other debt.
"At December 31, 2022, Bank of America Corporation's senior notes of $205.9 billion included $179.1 billion of outstanding notes that are both TLAC eligible and callable at least one year before their stated maturities."
"Of these senior notes, $16.6 billion will be callable and become TLAC ineligible during 2023, and $21.4 billion, $21.3 billion, $16.0 billion and $24.4 billion will do so during each of 2024 through 2027, respectively, and $79.4 billion thereafter."
We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile.
"While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter."
"We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC- eligible debt."
"During 2022, we issued $12.5 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities."
"We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt."
"We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes."
"We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date."
"Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price."
"For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding."
"For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 126."
Uninsured Deposits The FDIC insures the Corporations U.
"S. deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category, and various country-specific funds insure non-U."

Contingency Planning We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity.
These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions.
We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.
Our U.
S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window.
Certain non-U.
S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate.
"While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary."
Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings.
"In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives."
"Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies."
"Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations."
"Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control."
"The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any 104 Bank of America 2022 time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels ."
"Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating agencies assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our corporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the U."
S. government; current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies views on whether the U.
S. government would provide meaningful support to the Corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis.
"On September 19, 2022, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of the Corporation."
"Fitch also affirmed and withdrew the long-term and short-term ratings on certain subsidiaries, as they are no longer considered relevant to the agencys coverage."
"On January 23, 2023, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) placed the long-term rating of the Corporation as well as the long-term rating of its rated subsidiaries, including BANA, on review for upgrade."
"The agency cited the Corporations strengthened capital ratios, improved earnings profile and continued commitment to maintaining a restrained risk appetite as drivers of the review."
A review for upgrade indicates that those ratings are under consideration for a change in the near term and typically concludes within 90 days.
Moodys concurrently affirmed all Prime-1 short-term ratings of the Corporation and rated subsidiaries.
"The current ratings and outlooks for the Corporation and its subsidiaries from Standard & Poors Global Ratings (S&P) were not the subject of any rating actions during 2022 or through February 22, 2023."
Table 18 presents the Corporations current long-term/short- term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.

"In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity."
"If the short-term credit ratings of our Parent, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material."
"While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a companys long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties."
"For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk Liquidity Stress Analysis on page 103."

"The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual payment, on demand, of amounts payable on the Guaranteed Notes if not paid by BofA Finance."
"In addition, each of BAC Capital Trust XIII, BAC Capital Trust XIV and BAC Capital Trust XV, Delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the Trusts), is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and sold trust preferred securities (the Trust Preferred Bank of America 2022 105 Securities) or capital securities (the Capital Securities and, together with the Guaranteed Notes and the Trust Preferred Securities, the Guaranteed Securities), as applicable, that remained outstanding at December 31, 2022."
"The Corporation guarantees the payment of amounts and distributions with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities and Capital Securities if not paid by the Trusts, to the extent of funds held by the Trusts, and this guarantee, together with the Corporations other obligations with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities and Capital Securities, effectively constitutes a full and unconditional guarantee of the Trusts payment obligations on the Trust Preferred Securities or Capital Securities, as applicable."
No other subsidiary of the Corporation guarantees the Guaranteed Securities.
"BofA Finance and each of the Trusts are finance subsidiaries, have no independent assets, revenues or operations and are dependent upon the Corporation and/or the Corporations other subsidiaries to meet their respective obligations under the Guaranteed Securities in the ordinary course."
"If holders of the Guaranteed Securities make claims on their Guaranteed Securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding, any recoveries on those claims will be limited to those available under the applicable guarantee by the Corporation, as described above."
The Corporation is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for liquidity.
"Applicable laws and regulations and intercompany arrangements entered into in connection with the Corporations resolution plan could restrict the availability of funds from subsidiaries to the Corporation, which could adversely affect the Corporations ability to make payments under its guarantees."
"In addition, the obligations of the Corporation under the guarantees of the Guaranteed Securities will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to assets of the Corporation for payments."
"If the Corporation, as guarantor of the Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially all of its assets to one or more direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiaries, under the indenture governing the Guaranteed Notes, the subsidiary or subsidiaries will not be required to assume the Corporations obligations under its guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes."

"Representations and Warranties Obligations For information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.
"Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds."
"We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held- for-sale and unfunded lending commitments, which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees."
"Derivative positions are recorded at fair value, and assets held- for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value."
Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option.
Credit risk for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings.
"For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts."
We use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes.
The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral.
Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures.
"For more information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see Note 3 Derivatives and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral and other support given current events, conditions and expectations."
We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below.
We refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment.
"To mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures."
"We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories."
"During 2022, asset quality generally improved compared to 2021."
"Our 2022 net charge-off ratio remained near historic lows, and nonperforming loans and commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased compared to 2021, which was partially offset by an increase in reservable criticized exposure associated with our direct exposure to Russia as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict."
"While uncertainty around the pandemic has diminished, uncertainty remains regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and the current geopolitical situation and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods."

Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrowers credit cycle.
"Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns."
"Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external 106 Bank of America 2022 sources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process."
"These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk."
"Consumer Credit Portfolio During 2022, the U."
"S. unemployment rate continued to decline and home prices increased compared to 2021, although they began to decline in the second half of 2022 as inflationary pressures continued to persist."
"During 2022, net charge-offs were $1.9 billion, relatively unchanged compared to 2021."
"During 2022, nonperforming loans declined primarily due to decreases from consumer real estate loan sales, partially offset by increases from loans whose prior-period deferrals expired and were modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) during the first quarter of 2022."
The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $204 million during 2022 to $7.2 billion.

"(2) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR."
"Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $117 million in 2022 primarily due to decreases from consumer real estate loan sales in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by increases from loans whose prior-period deferrals expired and were modified in TDRs during the first quarter of 2022."
"Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2022, $1.4 billion, or 63 percent, were current on contractual payments."
Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $22 million.
Net charge-offs of $72 million for 2022 increased $100 million compared to 2021 primarily due to loan sales that occurred in the second quarter of 2022.
"Of the $218.0 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2022, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans."
"The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period was $3.4 billion, or six percent, at December 31, 2022."
Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experience a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole.
"At December 31, 2022, $64 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $844 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio."
"In addition, at December 31, 2022, $204 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $79 million were contractually current."
Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well- collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years.
Approximately 96 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later.
"Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio."
"The Los Angeles-Long Beach- Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 14 percent and 15 percent of outstandings at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent of outstandings at both December 31, 2022 and 2021."

"Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $120 million to $510 million at December 31, 2022, primarily driven by loan sales."
"Of the nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2022, $275 million, or 54 percent, were current on contractual payments."
"In addition, $167 million, or 33 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell."
Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $61 million in 2022.
Net recoveries decreased $29 million to $90 million in 2022 compared to 2021.
"Of the $26.6 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2022, as shown in Table 23, 13 percent require interest-only payments."
"The outstanding balance of HELOCs that had reached the end of their draw period and entered the amortization period was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2022."
The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole.
"At December 31, 2022, $53 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more."
"In addition, at December 31, 2022, $354 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming."
"For our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period."
"During 2022, 10 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs."

"In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans."
Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customers interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months.
"Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs."
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $624 million and $672 million, of which $540 million and $599 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms."
Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position.
"As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards."
"Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty."
"In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the total borrower or counterparty relationship."
We use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations.
We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios.
"In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses."
"As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay."
"In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs."
"For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite.
"We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size."
"We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type."
"In addition, within our non-U."
"S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country."
"Tables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations."
"We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio."
"For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 36 Bank of America 2022 111 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 115."
"We account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option."
"Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity."
"In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures."
"To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection."
These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.
"In addition, we are a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U."
S. and other countries.
"As a member, we may be required to pay a pro- rata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios."
"For more information, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Commercial Credit Portfolio During 2022, commercial credit quality improved as charge-offs, nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined."
"Due to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict, all direct exposure to Russian counterparties was downgraded and reported as reservable criticized exposure, and expected credit losses (ECL) have been incorporated into our estimate of the allowance for credit losses."
"Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $45.9 billion during 2022 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in Global Banking ."
This increase was partially offset by lower U.
S. small business commercial loans due to repayments of PPP loans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the terms of the program.
Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers generally improved from 2021 as pandemic-impacted sectors are recovering.
"However, many commercial real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges, tenant difficulties and challenging capital markets."
Demand for office space continues to be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use.
"The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses remained relatively unchanged at $5.4 billion at December 31, 2022, as loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook were offset by asset quality improvement and a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties."
"For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 120."
Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $51.3 billion during 2022 to $704.9 billion primarily driven by higher loans and leases and derivative assets.
"The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 56 percent at both December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"Table 29 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure."

Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure that is determined on an industry-by-industry basis.
A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring.

Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures.
"To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection."
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $9.0 billion and $2.6 billion."
We recorded net losses of $37 million in 2022 compared to net losses $91 million in 2021.
The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures.

"In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes."
"We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker- dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors."
"Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk."
We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts.
"In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our purchased credit default protection."
"In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis."
"Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades."

"Bank of America 2022 121 Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings."
"This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment."
"We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities)."
"In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results."
"For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 126."
Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are non- trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost).
"However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates."
The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non- trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our ALM activities.
We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option.
Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income.
Trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors.
"The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets."
"In addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility."
We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments.
The key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management section.
GRM is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed.
"These responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements."
Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions.
Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports.
"Given that models are used across the Corporation, model risk impacts all risk types including credit, market and operational risks."
"The Enterprise Model Risk Policy defines model risk standards, consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice."
"All models, including risk management, valuation and regulatory capital models, must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model, independent model testing and ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis and benchmarking."
"The Enterprise Model Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the MRC, oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation."
Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates.
"These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives."
"Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps."
Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.
S. dollar.
The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.
"S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U."
S. interest rates.
"Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, and foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits."
Mortgage Risk Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments.
"The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility."
Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms.
"For example, we trade and engage in market- making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral."
"In addition, we originate a variety of MBS, which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio."
We also record MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities.
"Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and forwards as well as securities including MBS and U."
S. Treasury securities.
"For more information, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 127."
Equity Market Risk Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments.
"Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products."
"Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions."
"Commodity Risk Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets."
"These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options."
"Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions."
122 Bank of America 2022 Issuer Credit Risk Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers.
"Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults."
"Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments."
"Market Liquidity Risk Market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease."
This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results.
This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments.
We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management.
"Trading Risk Management To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions."
Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks.
Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation.
"These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing."
Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees.
Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations.
"Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments."
"VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification."
A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses.
"VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data."
We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data.
"Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days."
"Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company."
The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio.
A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available.
"For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position."
This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.
VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results.
"In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced."
"In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model."
A minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in VaR.
These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP.
"For more information regarding ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 96."
"GRM continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio."
Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.
"Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks."
"Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities."
Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors.
All trading limits are approved at least annually.
Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system.
Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review.
Certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the Corporations Risk Appetite Statement.
These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board.
"In periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses."
"As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk."
"Table 43 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio."
"Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications."
These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market.
"Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions."
"Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval."
"In addition, Table 43 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their corresponding hedges."
"Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 43 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being Bank of America 2022 123 used."
"The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below, it is one day."
Both measures utilize the same process and methodology.
"The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 43 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges."
The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment.
"Table 43 presents year-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for 2022 and 2021 using a 99 percent confidence level."
The amounts disclosed in Table 43 and Table 44 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations.
"Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval."
The annual average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for 2022 compared to 2021 driven by heightened market volatility and reduced diversification across asset classes.

"n/a = not applicable The following graph presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for 2022, corresponding to the data in Table 43."
Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 44 at the same level of detail as in Table 43.
"Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution."
Table 44 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for 2022 and 2021.
"124 Bank of America 2022 Table 44 Average Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities 99 percent and 95 percent VaR Statistics 2022 2021 (Dollars in millions) 99 percent 95 percent 99 percent 95 percent Foreign exchange $ 21 $ 12 $ 12 $ 8 Interest rate 36 17 40 20 Credit 71 28 69 21 Equity 20 11 24 12 Commodities 13 7 8 4 Portfolio diversification (91) (46) (100) (39) Total covered positions portfolio Impact from less liquid exposures Total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio 70 38 108 29 7 36 53 20 73 26 2 28 Fair value option loans 51 14 50 12 Fair value option hedges 17 10 16 9 Fair value option portfolio diversification (36) (13) (32) (9) Total fair value option portfolio 32 11 34 12 Portfolio diversification (11) (7) (10) (7) Total market-based portfolio $ 129 $ 40 $ 97 $ 33 Backtesting The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue."
A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day.
These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to help confirm that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses.
We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested.
"For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year."
The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.
The trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation.
This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR.
"Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day trading revenues."
"We conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors."
These results are reported to senior market risk management.
Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.
"During 2022, there was one day where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period."
"Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets."
"For more information on fair value, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand.
"Also, trading- related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever- changing market environment."
Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.
The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2022 and 2021.
"During 2022, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 99 percent of the trading days, of which 90 percent were daily trading gains of over $25million, and the largest loss was $9 million."
"This compares to 2021 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of which 80 percent were daily trading gains of over $25million, and the largest loss was $45 million."
"Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis."
This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements.
"A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses."
These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR.
Bank of America 2022 125 Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress.
"Generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario."
Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events.
Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information.
"In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio."
The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.
Stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework.
The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise- wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning.

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities.
Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet.
Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates.
"Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet."
We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income.
"The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the future direction of interest rate movements as implied by market-based forward curves."
We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions.
"The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies."
"Thus, we continually monitor our banking book balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes."
"The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization."
Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.
"Table 45 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in developing the forward curve used in our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"Table 45 Forward Rates December 31, 2022 Federal Three-month 10-Year Funds LIBOR Swap Spot rates 4.50 % 4.77 % 3.84 % 12-month forward rates 4.75 4.78 3.62 December 31, 2021 Spot rates 0.25 % 0.21 % 1.58 % 12-month forward rates 1.00 1.07 1.84 Table 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2022 and 2021 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve."
"Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment."
The interest rate scenarios also assume U.
S. dollar interest rates are floored at zero.
"Depending on the level of interest rates, Down-rate scenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock, particularly in low rate environments."
"The overall decrease in asset sensitivity, as shown in the following table, to Up-rate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in long-end and short-end rates."
We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve.
"Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules."
"Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities."
"For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 97."
"Table 46 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes Short Long Rate Rate December 31 (Dollars in millions) (bps) (bps) 2022 2021 Parallel Shifts +100bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 3,829 $ 6,542 -100 bps instantaneous shift -100 -100 (4,591) n/m Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 3,698 4,982 Long-end instantaneous change -100 (157) n/m Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -100 (4,420) n/m Long-end instantaneous change +100 131 1,646 n/m = not meaningful 126 Bank of America 2022 The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates."
"As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity."
The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income.
The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments.
"In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios."
Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
"Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks."
"Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options."
The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives.
Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 46.
The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations.
"By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant."
Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporations non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments.
These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk.
"However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant."
"For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others."
We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.
Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business.
Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations.
Changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market.
An increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments.
"Conversely, when there is an increase in interest rates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations."
"Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities."
"During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $78 million, $39 million and $321 million."
"For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Compliance and Operational Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and our internal policies and procedures (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations)."
"We are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws, rules and regulations in the U."
"S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including those related to financial crimes and anti- money laundering, market conduct, trading activities, fair lending, privacy, data protection and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices."
"Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, people or external events, and includes legal risk."
"Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions."
"The Corporation faces a number of key operational risks including third-party risk, model risk, conduct risk, technology risk, information security risk and data risk."
Operational risk can result in financial losses and reputational impacts and is a component in the calculation of total RWA used in the Basel 3 capital calculation.
"For more information on Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management on page 96."
"FLUs and control functions are first and foremost responsible for managing all aspects of their businesses, including their compliance and operational risk."
"FLUs and control functions are required to understand their business processes and related risks and controls, including third-party dependencies and the related regulatory requirements, and monitor and report on the effectiveness of the control environment."
"In order to actively monitor and assess the performance of their processes and controls, they must conduct comprehensive quality assurance activities and identify issues and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses."
"FLUs and control functions must also adhere to compliance and operational risk appetite limits to meet strategic, capital and financial planning objectives."
"Finally, FLUs and control functions are responsible for the proactive identification, management and escalation of compliance and operational risks across the Corporation."
"Collectively, these efforts are important to strengthen their compliance and operational resiliency, which is the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption."
"Global Compliance and Operational Risk teams independently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor business activities and processes and evaluate FLUs and control functions for adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying issues and risks, and reporting Bank of America 2022 127 on the state of the control environment."
Corporate Audit provides an independent assessment and validation through testing of key compliance and operational risk processes and controls across the Corporation.
The Corporation's Global Compliance Enterprise Policy and Operational Risk Management Enterprise Policy set the requirements for reporting compliance and operational risk information to executive management as well as the Board or appropriate Board-level committees and reflect Global Compliance and Operational Risks responsibilities for conducting independent oversight of the Corporations compliance and operational risk management activities.
"The Board provides oversight of compliance risk through its Audit Committee and the ERC, and operational risk through its ERC."
"A key operational risk facing the Corporation is information security, which includes cybersecurity."
"Cybersecurity risk includes exposure to failures or interruptions of service or security breaches resulting from malicious technological attacks that impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our or third parties' operations, systems or data."
"The Corporation seeks to mitigate information security risk and associated reputational and compliance risk by employing a multi-layered and intelligence-led Global Information Security Program focused on preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to and recovering from cyber threats and incidents and effectively operating the Corporations processes."
"Additionally, our business continuity policy, standards and procedures are designed to maintain the availability of business functions and enable impacted units within the Corporation and third parties to achieve strategic objectives in the event of a cybersecurity incident."
The Global Information Security Program is supported by three lines of defense.
"The Global Information Security Team within the first line of defense is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Global Information Security Program, which includes defining policies and procedures to safeguard the Corporations information systems and data, conducting vulnerability and third-party information security assessments, information security event management (e.g., responding to ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks), evaluation of external cyber intelligence, supporting industry cybersecurity efforts and working with governmental agencies, and developing employee training to support adherence to the Corporations policies and procedures."
"As the second line of defense, Global Compliance and Operational Risk independently assesses, monitors and tests information security risk across the Corporation, as well as the effectiveness of the Global Information Security Program."
"Corporate Audit serves as the third line of defense, conducting additional independent review and validation of the first-line processes and functions."
"As part of our Global Information Security Program, we leverage both internal and external assessments and partnerships with industry leaders to help approach information security holistically."
"Additionally the Corporation maintains a comprehensive enterprise-wide program that defines standards for the planning, sourcing, management, and oversight of third- party relationships and third-party access to its system, facilities, and/or confidential or proprietary data for a business purpose or supervisory function."
"Through established governance structures, we have processes to help facilitate appropriate and effective oversight of information security risk."
"These routines enable our three lines of defense and management to debate information security risks and monitor control performance to allow for further escalation to executive management, management and Board-level committees or to the Board, as appropriate."
The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of Bank of Americas Global Information Security Program and devotes significant time and attention to the oversight of cybersecurity and information security risk.
The Board regularly discusses cybersecurity and information security risks with the Chief Technology and Information Officer and the Chief Information Security Officer.
"Additionally, the ERC receives regular reporting, and reviews and approves the Information Security Program and Policy on an annual basis."
Reputational Risk Management Reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.
"Reputational risk may result from many of the Corporations activities, including those related to the management of our strategic, operational, compliance and credit risks."
The Corporation manages reputational risk through established policies and controls embedded throughout its business and risk management processes.
We proactively monitor and identify potential reputational risk events and have processes established to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner.
"If reputational risk events occur, we focus on remediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize damage to the Corporations reputation."
"The Corporation has processes and procedures in place to respond to events that give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, implementing external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential reputational risks."
The Corporations organization and governance structure provides oversight of reputational risks.
"Reputational risk reporting is provided regularly and directly to senior management and the ERC, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk."
"In addition, each FLU has a committee, which includes representatives from Legal and Risk, that is responsible for the oversight of reputational risk, including approval for business activities that present elevated levels of reputational risks."
"Climate Risk Management Climate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and (2) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes."
"These changes and events may have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as physical risk and transition risk."
These risks may impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types.
Physical risk may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral.
"Physical risk may also increase operational risk by impacting the Corporations facilities, employees, customers or vendors."
"Transition risks may amplify credit risk through the financial impacts of changes in policy, technology or the market on the Corporation or its counterparties."
Unanticipated market changes can lead to sudden price adjustments and give rise to heightened market risk.
"In addition, reputational risk may arise, including from our climate-related practices and disclosures and if we do not meet our climate-related commitments."
"Effective management of climate risk requires coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well- 128 Bank of America 2022 developed processes to identify, measure, monitor and control risks."
"As climate risk spans all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk management programs established for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks."
"Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework aligns with our Risk Framework and provides additional clarity and transparency regarding our approach to environmental and social risks, inclusive of climate risk."
"Our governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk practices and strategies by the Board, supported by its ERC, as well as the MRC and the Responsible Growth Committee, both of which are management-level committees comprised of senior leaders across every major FLU and control function."
"The Responsible Growth Committee is supported by the ESG Disclosure sub-committee, which is responsible for reviewing and providing oversight of the Corporations climate and ESG-related public disclosures."
Our climate risk management efforts are overseen by an executive officer who reports to the CRO.
"The Climate Risk Council, which consists of leaders across risk, FLU and control functions, meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing climate-related risks in line with our Risk Framework."
"In 2021, we publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal) and set 2030 emissions targets for our operations and supply chain."
"In connection with our Net Zero Goal, in 2022, we announced a target to reduce emissions by 2030 associated with our financing activities related to auto manufacturing, energy and power generation (2030 Targets)."
"In our September 2022 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report, we disclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed emissions and emissions intensity metrics for these sectors, with 2019 serving as the baseline for our 2030 Targets."
"We plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in 2023, and we plan to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by April 2024."
"Achieving our climate--related goals and targets, including our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets, may require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, new standards and public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital for the transition to a low-carbon economy and better emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders."
"Given the extended period of these and other climate-related goals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position in the relevant periods presented herein."
"For more information about climate-related matters, including how the Corporation manages climate risk, and the Corporations climate-related goals and commitments, including our plans to achieve our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets and progress on our sustainable finance goals, see the Corporations website, including our 2022 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report and the 2022 Annual Report to shareholders available on the Investor Relations portion of our website in March 2023."
The contents of the Corporations website and 2022 Annual Report to shareholders are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
"For more information on climate-related risks, see Item 1A."
Risk Factors of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
"The foregoing discussion and our discussion in the 2022 Annual Report to shareholders regarding our goals and commitments with respect to climate risk management, including environmental transition considerations, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."
"These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporations control."
"Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements."
"Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are essential in understanding the MD&A."
Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities.
We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.
The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion.
We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates.
"In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models."
"Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs."
Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations.
"Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions."
"Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results."
These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.
Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.
Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
"The determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on numerous estimates and assumptions, which require Bank of America 2022 129 a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated."
A critical judgment in the process is the weighting of our forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios that are incorporated into our quantitative models.
"As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation, which have included a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario."
"The overall economic outlook is weighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in 2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower gross domestic product (GDP) and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared to the prior year."
"Generally, as the consensus estimates improve or deteriorate, the allowance for credit losses will change in a similar direction."
"There are multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with the key variables including, but not limited to, U."
S. GDP and unemployment rates.
"As of December 31, 2021, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U."
"S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.2 percent, 4.7 percent and 4.3 percent in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U."
"S. GDP was forecasted to grow at 2.1 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively."
"As of December 31, 2022, the latest consensus estimates for the U."
S. average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 3.7 percent and U.
"S. GDP was forecasted to grow 0.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a tighter labor market and depressed growth expectations compared to our macroeconomic outlook as of December 31, 2021, and were factored into our allowance for credit losses estimate as of December 31, 2022."
"In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U."
"S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.6 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U."
S. GDP was forecasted to contract 0.4 percent and grow 1.2 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024.
"In addition to the above judgments and estimates, the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in our commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a primary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all of which have some degree of uncertainty."
"The allowance for credit losses increased to $14.2 billion from $13.8 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily due to loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook in 2022."
"To provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the macroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the estimate of our allowance for credit losses, the Corporation compared the December 31, 2022 modeled ECL from the baseline scenario and our adverse scenario."
"Relative to the baseline scenario, the adverse scenario assumed a peak U."
"S. unemployment rate of nearly three percentage points higher than the baseline scenario, a decline in U."
S. GDP followed by a prolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a difference of approximately eight percent at the trough.
This sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $4 billion.
"While the sensitivity analysis may be useful to understand how changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our modeled ECLs, it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for credit losses is expected to change in a different macroeconomic outlook."
"Importantly, the analysis does not incorporate a variety of factors, including qualitative reserves and the weighting of alternate scenarios, which could have offsetting effects on the estimate."
"Considering the variety of factors contemplated when developing and weighting macroeconomic outlooks such as recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends, in addition to other qualitative factors, the Corporation believes the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 is appropriate."
"Fair Value of Financial Instruments Under applicable accounting standards, we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value."
We classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards.
"The fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate."
Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs.
"Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date."
Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity.
"In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process."
"In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products."
"Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs."
Our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling.
"For example, broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable."
These processes and controls are performed independently of the business.
"For more information, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards."
"The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and 130 Bank of America 2022 MSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation."
"Level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy."
The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital.
We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis.
"Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace."
"For more information on transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date."
"We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction."
"Net deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements."
"NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods."
We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized.
"Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities."
"These revisions of our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters, may be material to our operating results for any given period."

The Corporations internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
"The Corporations internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporations assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"Management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) ."
"Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Corporations internal control over financial reporting is effective."
"The Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers , LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022."

"Borthwick Chief Financial Officer 134 Bank of America 2022 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bank of America Corporation Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements)."
"We also have audited the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)."
"In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America."
"Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO."
"Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020."
"Basis for Opinions The Corporations management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting."
Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Corporations consolidated financial statements and on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.
S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
"Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects."
"Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks."
"Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements."
"Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements."
"Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk."
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
"A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."
"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements."
"Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."
"Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments."
"The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate."
"Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses - Commercial and Consumer Card Loans As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses represents managements estimate of the expected credit losses in the Bank of America 2022 135 Corporations loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option."
"As of December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $12.7 billion on total loans and leases of $1,040.0 billion, which excludes loans accounted for under the fair value option."
"For commercial and consumer card loans, the expected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan."
"In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets."
These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses.
"These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads."
"The scenarios that are chosen and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party economists and industry trends."
"Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions."
"Factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others."
"Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data."
"The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in developing lifetime economic forecast scenarios, related weightings to each scenario and certain qualitative reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge."
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
"These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses, including controls over the evaluation and approval of models, forecast scenarios and related weightings, and qualitative reserves."
"These procedures also included, among others, testing managements process for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the loss forecast models and methodology, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of managements development, selection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios used in the loss forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the model output results to determine the overall allowance for loan and lease losses."
"The procedures also included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain loss forecast models, the reasonableness of economic forecast scenarios and related weightings and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves."
"Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments As described in Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation carries certain financial instruments at fair value, which includes $10.7 billion of assets and $7.1 billion of liabilities classified as Level 3 fair value measurements that are valued on a recurring basis and $3.4 billion of assets classified as Level 3 fair value measurements that are valued on a nonrecurring basis, for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation."
"The Corporation determines the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement."
"Unobservable inputs, such as volatility or implied yield, may be determined using quantitative-based extrapolations, pricing models or other internal methodologies which incorporate management estimates and available market information."
"The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment and estimation used by management to determine the fair value of these financial instruments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge."
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
"These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including controls related to valuation models, significant unobservable inputs, and data."
"These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these certain financial instruments and comparison of managements estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value."
Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and evaluating the reasonableness of managements significant unobservable inputs.

"140 Bank of America 2022 Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles Bank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U."
S. and in certain international markets.
"The term the Corporation as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporations subsidiaries or affiliates."
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
"Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary."
Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting.
"These investments, which include the Corporations interests in affordable housing and renewable energy partnerships, are recorded in other assets."
"Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporations proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income."
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures.
Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
New Accounting Standards Hedge Accounting The FASB issued a new accounting standard that makes targeted improvements to the application of the fair value hedge accounting guidance for closed portfolios of financial assets.
"The targeted improvements were effective January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis."
Financial Instruments Credit Losses The FASB amended the accounting and disclosure requirements for expected credit losses (ECL) by removing the recognition and measurement guidance on troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and adding disclosures on the financial effect and subsequent performance of certain types of modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.
"The effects of these changes on the Corporations consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are not significant."
"The amendments were effective on January 1, 2023, which the Corporation adopted using a modified retrospective approach."
"Significant Accounting Principles Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations, and amounts due from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain non-U."
S. central banks.
Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.
Securities Financing Agreements Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized financing transactions except in instances where the transaction is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions.
"Generally, these agreements are recorded at acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest."
"In instances where the interest is negative, the Corporations policy is to present negative interest on financial assets as interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense."
"For securities financing agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option, the changes in the fair value of these securities financing agreements are recorded in market making and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income."
The Corporations policy is to monitor the market value of the principal amount loaned under resale agreements and obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when appropriate.
"Securities financing agreements do not create material credit risk due to these collateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not necessary."
"In transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities."
Trading Instruments Financial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value.
Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities.
"If these market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation."
Realized gains and losses are recorded on a trade- date basis.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in market making and similar activities.
"Derivatives and Hedging Activities Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or to support risk management activities."
Derivatives used in risk management activities include derivatives that are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships (referred to as other risk management activities).
The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives.
"Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts."
"Bank of America 2022 141 All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis."
"For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable market-based pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives."
"For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation."
Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk.
These values also take into account the Corporations own credit standing.
Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities Derivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making and similar activities.
Derivatives used for other risk management activities are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities.
Derivatives used in other risk management activities have not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective.
"The changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in other income."
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are included in market making and similar activities.
Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures.
The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in market making and similar activities and other income.
"Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges) For accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges."
"Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction."
"The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship."
Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the Corporations assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility.
"Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item."
"If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying value of that asset or liability."
"For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability."
Cash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
The Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk associated with deferred compensation.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings.
Components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item.
Net investment hedges are used to manage the foreign exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign operation.
Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI.
The remaining components of these derivatives are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market making and similar activities.
Securities Debt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade date.
Their classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities were acquired.
Debt securities purchased for use in the Corporations trading activities are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in market making and similar activities.
Substantially all other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporations asset and liability management (ALM) activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either debt securities carried at fair value or as held-to- maturity (HTM) debt securities.
Debt securities carried at fair value are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in market making and similar activities.
HTM debt securities are debt securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost.
The Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has declined below amortized cost.
"If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings."
"For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for ECL, except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U."
"S. Treasury, U."
S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit loss assumption.
"For the remaining AFS debt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral."
"If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the Corporation to 142 Bank of America 2022 determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an ECL."
The Corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation allowance to its current estimate of expected credit losses.
"Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information available such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral."
"If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI."
"In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset."
"The Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit losses, of which substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption."
"For the remaining securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses."
"Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income."
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the securities.
Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method.
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other income.
"Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus qualifying observable price changes."
These securities are reported in other assets.
"Loans and Leases Loans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are measured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts."
Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans.
"Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology."
The Corporation elects to account for certain consumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or other income.
"Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivable."
"A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing receivable is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk."
"The Corporations three portfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial."
The classes within the Consumer Real Estate consumer.
The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are U.
"S. commercial, non-U."
"S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U."
S. small business commercial.
Leases The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lessor arrangements.
"Direct financing leases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method."
Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis.
The Corporation's lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.
"Allowance for Credit Losses On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on managements best estimate of the ECL in the Corporations loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option."
"Upon adoption, a $3.3 billion, or 32 percent, increase in the allowance for credit losses was recorded on January 1, 2020, which was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $310million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments."
The ECL on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contra- asset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
"The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities."
The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the current estimate of ECL.
"For loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan."
The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected prepayments.
The contractual maturity includes any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower.
"For open- ended products (e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation does not record any allowance."
"In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets."
These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses.
"These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads."
As any one economic portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity.
"outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio multiple scenarios."
"The scenarios that are chosen each quarter segment are credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other Bank of America 2022 143 and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends."
"The estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance)."
"If a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current amortized cost balance."
"Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off."
"The allowance for loan and lease losses for TDRs is measured based on the present value of projected future lifetime principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate, or in cases where foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the loans collateral value or its observable market price, if available."
"The measurement of ECL for the renegotiated consumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average TDR portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring."
Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same economic outlook as discussed above.
"For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool."
"Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions described above."
"For example, factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others."
"Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data."
"With the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies consumer loans as nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest income for these loans at that time."
"For credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses."
"Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded."
The Corporation has identified the following three portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.
"Consumer Real Estate To estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling methodologies."
"The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporations ECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy)."
"The estimates are based on the Corporations historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook."
The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates.
"The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured."
"The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of the Corporations HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met."
The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time of default.
"For loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell."
The fair value of the collateral securing these loans is generally determined using an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located.
"In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral."
"While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate."
"For loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the Corporations fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that is in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off."
"If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative charge- off amount."
Credit Cards and Other Consumer Credit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date.
"The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable balance to pay off."
The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the economic outlook described above.
"The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first)."
Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount.
"Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model."
Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.
The ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined using quantitative methods supplemented with 144 Bank of America 2022 qualitative analysis.
"The quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value."
Commercial The ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the loans contractual life at an individual loan level.
The models use the contractual terms to forecast future principal cash flows while also considering expected prepayments.
"For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrowers draw and payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment."
"For loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region."
"The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate."
"For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrowers current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market."
"The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrowers industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market."
"Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the economic outlook, and the model considers key economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns."
"In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option."
Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies as the funded exposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments.
"Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies Nonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status."
Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming.
"When a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible, it is charged off against the allowance for credit losses."
"If the charged-off amount is later recovered, the amount is reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the recovery date."
Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs).
"If recoveries for the period are greater than charge- offs, net charge-offs are reported as a negative amount."
"In accordance with the Corporations policies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio)."
"Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming."
Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current.
"The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing, with the remaining balance classified as nonperforming."
"Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or upon confirmation of fraud."
"These loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans."
"Consumer vehicle loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud."
"These loans are charged off to their collateral values when the loans become 120 days past due, upon repossession of the collateral, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud."
"If repossession of the collateral is not expected, the loans are fully charged off."
"Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection."
Business card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans.
Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.
The entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customers billing statement.
"Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable."
Accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status.
"Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received."
Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.
Troubled Debt Restructurings Consumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are classified as TDRs.
"Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions designed to maximize collections."
Loans that are carried at fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs.
Loans and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected.
"Otherwise, the loans are Bank of America 2022 145 placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months."
"If accruing TDRs cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, they are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs."
Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge.
Such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the time of discharge.
"If these loans are contractually current, interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash basis."
Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.
"Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or, for loans that have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120 days past due."
A loan that had previously been modified in a TDR and is subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.
"Loans Held-for-sale Loans that the Corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable future, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value."
"The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option."
"Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income."
"LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases."
Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
"Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements ."
"Other Assets For the Corporations financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques."
"For assets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions, including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be zero."
"For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses, including consideration of historical losses and current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset."
Lessee Arrangements Substantially all of the Corporations lessee arrangements are operating leases.
"Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement."
"Right-of-use assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities."
All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
The Corporation made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases.
"As such, lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components."
"At lease commencement, lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the Corporations incremental borrowing rate."
"Right-of-use assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and for any lease incentives."
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired.
"Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level."
A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a business segment.
"The Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting unit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity."
"For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units."
Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit.
"In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value."
"Qualitative factors include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations."
"If the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed."
The Corporation has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
The Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
"When performing the quantitative assessment, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered impaired."
"If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by 146 Bank of America 2022 which the reporting units allocated equity exceeds its fair value."
An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit.
"An impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance."
"For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value."
The carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.
Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization.
An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value.
Variable Interest Entities A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments.
The Corporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
"On a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing documents and its financial interests in the VIE."
The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change as a result of such reassessments.
"The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle."
"When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust."
The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust.
The power to direct the most significant activities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights.
"The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust."
The Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts.
"The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trusts liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust."
The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights.
"Other VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles."
"The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO."
"However, following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO."
"The Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements."
The Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle.
Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value.
"In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued by unconsolidated VIEs."
"Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets."
"Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests are not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows."
"Fair Value The Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price."
"Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value."
"Under applicable accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs."
The Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.
Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
"Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U."
S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets.
"Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities."
Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
This category generally includes U.
"S. government and Bank of America 2022 147 agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS."
Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
"The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability."
"This category generally includes retained residual interests in securitizations, consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets."
Income Taxes There are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred.
Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period.
Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods.
These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be realized.
"Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement."
The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit.
"The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense."
Revenue Recognition The following summarizes the Corporations revenue recognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities.
"Card Income Card income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as interchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items from credit and debit card transactions and from processing card transactions for merchants."
Card income is presented net of direct costs.
Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding payment networks rates.
"Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months."
Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease losses.
Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner payments.
"Rewards paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards."
"The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance."
The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed.
The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners.
The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes.
"As part of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card partners members or customers on behalf of the Corporation."
Service Charges Service charges include deposit and lending-related fees.
Deposit-related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed.
"Consumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money order processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions."
"Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporations Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and treasury management services, including account maintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep account and other cash management services."
"Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs."
Investment and Brokerage Services Investment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees.
Asset management fees are earned from the management of client assets under advisory agreements or the full discretion of the Corporations financial advisors (collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)).
Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of the clients AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps) to 150 bps of the AUM.
"In cases where a third party is used to obtain a clients investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services."
Brokerage fees include income earned from transaction- based services that are performed as part of investment management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount.
Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and sales commissions that are primarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment and are earned over time.
"In addition, primarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker."
"Certain customers pay brokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades."
"These fees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services."
Investment Banking Income Investment banking income includes underwriting income and financial advisory services income.
Underwriting consists of fees 148 Bank of America 2022 earned for the placement of a customers debt or equity securities.
The revenue is generally earned based on a percentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed.
"Once the number of shares or notes is determined and the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized."
"The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in performing these services."
These expenses are recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses.
"Syndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan syndication."
Financial advisory services consist of fees earned for assisting clients with transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings.
Revenue varies depending on the size of the transaction and scope of services performed and is generally contingent on successful completion of the transaction.
Revenue is typically recognized once the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered.
"Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the client."
"Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies The Corporation did not disclose the value of any open performance obligations at December 31, 2022, as its contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice."
"Earnings Per Common Share Earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted- average common shares outstanding, excluding unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation."
"Net income allocated to common shareholders is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities."
"Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable."
"Foreign Currency Translation Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity."
"When the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local currency, the assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the U."
S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations.
"The resulting unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax."
When the foreign entitys functional currency is the U.
"S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement gains or losses on foreign currency- denominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings."

ALM and Risk Management Derivatives The Corporations ALM and risk management activities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and derivatives used in other risk management activities.
"Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's ALM and risk management activities."
"The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility."
The Corporations goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital.
"As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value."
Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.
"Market risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business."
Market risk in the mortgage business is the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements.
"To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt securities."
"The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs."
"The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporations investments in non-U."
S. subsidiaries.
Exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate.
The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures.
"Credit derivatives include credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions."
These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.
Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges The Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates (fair value hedges).

"Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through Derivatives The Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred."
"At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had transferred $4.8 billion of non- U."
S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts.
"In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion at the transfer dates."
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the transferred securities was $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion."
Sales and Trading Revenue The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities.
"It is the Corporations policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments."
The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporations Global Markets business segment.
"The related sales and trading revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items, including market making and similar activities and net interest income as well as other revenue categories."
"Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities."
Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market.
"For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the Other column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table."
Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in market making and similar activities.
"For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in market making and similar activities."
"Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements."
"Therefore, this revenue is recorded in market making and similar activities as part of the initial mark to fair value."
"For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in market making and similar activities."
"In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income."
"The table below, which includes both derivatives and non- derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporations sales and trading revenue in Global Markets , categorized by primary risk, for 2022, 2021 and 2020."

Credit Derivatives The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures.
"Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event."
"Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium."
"For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has Bank of America 2022 155 occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non- specified amount."
investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these Credit derivatives are classified as investment and non- instruments.
investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying Credit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the referenced obligation.
"The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- seller of credit protection and their expiration at December 31, or higher as investment grade."

"As such, the notional amount is not a reliable investments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan 156 Bank of America 2022 obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles."
These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities.
The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporations maximum exposure to loss.
The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.
"Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral The Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial companies."
A significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis.
"Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades."
"Further, as previously discussed on page 152, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events."
"Certain of the Corporations derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted."
These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporations creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions.
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $101.3 billion and $91.4 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $81.2 billion and $79.3 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross- product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements."
"In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries."
The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.
"At December 31, 2022, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $3.2 billion, including $1.6 billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA)."
"Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee."
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant."
"The following table presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at December 31, 2022 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch."
The table also presents derivative liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties upon downgrade of the Corporation's or certain subsidiaries' long-term senior debt ratings.

Valuation Adjustments on Derivatives The Corporation records credit risk valuation adjustments on derivatives in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparties and its own credit quality.
The Corporation calculates valuation adjustments on derivatives based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors.
The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as enforceable master netting agreements and collateral.
CDS spread data is used to estimate the default probabilities and severities that are applied to the exposures.
"Where no observable credit default data is available for counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market data to estimate default probabilities and severity."
"The table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect of any related hedge activities), which are recorded in market making and similar activities, for 2022, 2021 and 2020."
CVA gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance.
DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance.
CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact.
FVA gains related to derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance.
FVA gains related to derivative liabilities increase the cumulative FVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance.
FVA losses have the opposite impact.

FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently.

Troubled Debt Restructurings Consumer Real Estate Modifications of consumer real estate loans are classified as TDRs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been granted.
"Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations thereof."
"Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs."
Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms.
"Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification."
Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.
"Consumer real estate loans of $211 million that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower were included in TDRs at December 31, 2022, of which $53 million were classified as nonperforming and $33 million were loans fully insured."
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant."
"Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $121 million and $101 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully- insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $871 million and $1.1 billion."
"During 2022 and 2021, the Corporation reclassified $190 million and $64 million of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets."
"The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows."

Credit Card and Other Consumer The Corporation seeks to assist customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal and local laws and guidelines.
"Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the customers available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs."
The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs).
"Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers entire unsecured debt structures (external programs)."
"The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge."

Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments.
Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer.
"Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 15 percent of new credit card TDRs and 15 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification."
"Commercial Loans Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporations loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy."
Each modification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower.
"Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporations risk exposure."
Bank of America 2022 169 3.92 Reductions in interest rates are rare.
"Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest."
"Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan."
"At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms."
"If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring."
"Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification."
"During 2022, the carrying value of the Corporations commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $1.9billion compared to $1.3billion and $1.2billion for 2021 and 2020."
"At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had commitments to lend $358 million, $283 million and $402 million to commercial borrowers whose loans were classified as TDRs."
"The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was $105 million, $262 million and $218 million at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020."
"Loans Held-for-sale The Corporation had LHFS of $6.9 billion and $15.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS were $32.0 billion, $43.6 billion and $20.1 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively."
"Cash used for originations and purchases of LHFS totaled $24.9 billion, $37.3 billion and $19.7 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively."
"Also included were non-cash net transfers into LHFS of $1.9 billion during 2022, primarily driven by the transfer of a $1.6 billion affinity card loan portfolio to held for sale that was sold in October 2022, and $808 million during 2021."
"Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans held- for-sale at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $3.8 billion and $2.2 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet."
"Outstanding credit card loan balances include unpaid principal, interest and fees."
"Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud."
"During 2022 and 2021, the Corporation reversed $332 million and $446 million of interest and fee income against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan."
"For the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during 2022 and 2021, interest and fee income reversed at the time the loans were classified as nonperforming was not significant."
"For more information on the Corporation's nonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles."
"Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan."
"Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions."
The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets.
"These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads."
"The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends."
"For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles ."
"The December 31, 2022 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic scenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario."
"The overall economic outlook is weighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in 2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower GDP and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared to the prior year."
The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.
S. average unemployment rate will be above five and a half percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 and will slowly decline to five percent by the fourth quarter of 2024.
"Additionally, in this economic outlook, U."
S. gross domestic product is forecasted to contract at 0.4 percent and grow at 1.2 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024.
"For comparison, as of December 31, 2021, the weighted economic outlook for the U."
S. average unemployment rate was forecasted to be just above five percent by the fourth quarter of 2022 and slowly decline to just under five percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 and U.
S. gross domestic product was forecasted at 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023.
"The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 was $14.2 billion, an increase of $379 million compared to December 31, 2021."
"The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties."
The change in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net increase of $295 million in the allowance for loan and lease losses and an increase of $84 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.
"The increase in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to increases in the credit card and other consumer portfolios of $341 million, and commercial portfolio of $177 million, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer real estate portfolio of $139 million."
The provision for credit losses increased $7.1 billion to an expense of $2.5 billion in 2022 compared to a benefit of $4.6 billion in 2021 and an expense of $11.3 billion in 2020.
"The increase in the provision for credit losses in 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced pandemic uncertainties."
The benefit in 2021 was primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.
"Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $68.7 billion in 2022 primarily driven by commercial loans, which increased $47.7 billion, driven by broad-based growth, and consumer loans which 170 Bank of America 2022 increased $21.0 billion, primarily driven by credit card and The changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net residential mortgage."

The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties.
The assets are transferred into a trust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations.
These assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle.
"The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities."
"For more information on the Corporations use of VIEs, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles."
"The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021 in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE."
"The tables also present the Corporations maximum loss exposure at December 31, 2022 and 2021 resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest."
"The Corporations maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements."
The Corporations maximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets.
"The Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to hold collateral."
These securities and loans are included in Note 4 Securities or Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses.
"In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs in connection with its funding activities."
"Bank of America 2022 171 The Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so."
"The Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $978 million and $968 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"First-lien Mortgage Securitizations As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-insured and U."
S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)- guaranteed mortgage loans.
"Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio."
"In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities."
The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes.
"Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts."
"Except as described in Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties."
"The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2022, 2021 and 2020."
"First-lien Mortgage Securitizations Residential Mortgage - Agency Commercial Mortgage (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Proceeds from loan sales (1) $ 8,084 $ 6,664 $ 15,823 $ 5,853 $ 10,874 $ 5,084 Gains on securitizations(2) 8 9 728 46 156 61 Repurchases from securitization trusts (3) 53 756 436 (1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored primarily by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and primarily receives residential mortgage- backed securities in exchange."
Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and are typically sold shortly after receipt.
(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option.
"Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $41 million, $121 million and $160 million net of hedges, during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are not included in the table above."
"(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make."
The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications.
Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.
The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate loans.
"The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $100.1 billion and $115.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $274 million, $392 million and $474 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively."
"Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion at December31, 2022 and 2021."
"For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements ."
"During 2022, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage securitization trusts with total assets of $784 million, with no significant deconsolidations in 2021."
"During 2020, the Corporation completed the sale of $9.3 billion of consumer real estate loans through GNMA loan securitizations."
"As part of the securitizations, the Corporation retained $8.4 billion of MBS, which are classified as debt securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet."

"Bank of America 2022 173 Home Equity Loans The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans."
"In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event."
This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the preceding table.
"The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows."
Credit Card Securitizations The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans.
"The Corporations continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (sellers interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts."
"During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation issued new senior debt securities to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust totaling $2.3 billion, $1.0 billion, and $1.0 billion, respectively."
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $6.7 billion and $6.5 billion."
These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent.
"During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the credit card securitization trust issued $363 million, $161 million and $161 million, respectively, of these subordinate securities."
"Resecuritization Trusts The Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics."
"Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust."
"The Corporation resecuritized $21.8 billion, $28.9 billion and $39.0 billion of securities during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively."
"Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded."
"Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair value of $2.4 billion, $2.2 billion and $6.1 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively."
"In 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the securities were classified as trading account assets."
All of the securities received as resecuritization proceeds during 2020 were classified as trading account assets.
"Of the securities received as resecuritization proceeds during 2020, $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion were classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value and HTM securities, respectively."

"The Corporations maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $914 million and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporations investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs."
"Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs The Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities."
CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers.
"The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs."
"The Corporations maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $197 million and $235 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"Investment VIEs The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation."
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporations consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $854 million and $1.0 billion."
"The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $12.2 billion and $7.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"The Corporations maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $2.4 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities."
"Leveraged Lease Trusts The Corporations net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft."
The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest.
The net investment represents the Corporations maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless.
Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.
"Tax Credit VIEs The Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects."
An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE.
"As an investor, tax credits associated with the investments in these entities are allocated to the Corporation, as provided by the U."
"S. Internal Revenue Code and related regulations, and are recognized as income tax benefits in the Corporations Consolidated Statement of Income in the year they are earned, which varies based on the type of investments."
"Tax credits from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments in affordable housing are recognized ratably over a term of up to 10 years, and tax credits from wind and solar energy investments are recognized either at inception for transactions electing Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced for transactions electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs), which is generally up to a 10-year time period."
The volume and types of investments held by the Corporation will influence the amount of tax credits recognized each period.
"The maximum loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $28.8 billion and $25.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"In addition to that amount, the Corporation had unfunded capital contributions for renewable energy investments of $1.9billion and $1.0billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
The capital contributions are contingent on various conditions precedent to funding over the next two years.
The Corporations risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.
"The Corporations investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $14.1 billion and $12.6 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of $6.6 billion and $5.8 billion, at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years.
"During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion and reported pretax losses in other income of $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion."
These tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporations annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter.
The Corporation may be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project.
Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.

"Repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions are generally either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term."
"The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing funding from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate."

"The weighted-average effective interest rates for tot al long- term debt (excluding senior structured notes), total fixed-rate debt and total floating-rate debt were 3.27 percent, 3.23 percent and 4.14 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2022, and 2.83 percent, 3.08 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2021."
The Corporations ALM activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility.
The Bank of America 2022 179 Corporations goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse effect on earnings and capital.
The weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the debt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions.
"The table below shows the carrying value for aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2022."
Included in the table are certain structured notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put options) at specified dates prior to maturity.
"Other structured notes have coupon or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value of a referenced index or security."
"In both cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the obligation for cash or other securities prior to the contractual maturity date."
These borrowings are reflected in the table as maturing at their contractual maturity date.

"NOTE 12 Commitments and Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments."
These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
"Credit Extension Commitments The Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers."
"The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions."
"The distributed amounts were $10.4 billion and $10.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"The carrying value of the Corporations credit extension commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, which predominantly related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments."
The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities.
Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrowers ability to pay.
"The following table includes the notional amount of commitments of $3.0 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 that are accounted for under the fair value option."
"However, the table excludes the cumulative net fair value for these commitments of $110 million and $97 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities."
"For more information regarding the Corporations loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see Note 21 Fair Value Option."

"(2) The notional amounts of SBLCs and financial guarantees classified as investment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying reference name within the instrument were $25.1 billion and $9.5 billion at December 31, 2022, and $26.3 billion and $8.7 billion at December 31, 2021."
"Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $575 million and $512 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
(3) Primarily includes second-loss positions on lease-end residual value guarantees.
(4) Includes business card unused lines of credit.
"Other Commitments At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $636 million and $181 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets, loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial loans of $294 million and $518 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets."
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $0 and $949 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets."
"At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $92.0 billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $57.8 billion and $32.6 billion as of both period ends."
These commitments generally expire within the next 12 months.
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $3.7 billion and $4.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner."
This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice.
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $571 million and $395 million."
"Other Guarantees Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks."
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $4.3 billion and $6.3 billion."
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporations maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $632 million and $928 million, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039."
"Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law."
The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote.
These agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events.
"The maximum potential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language and the timing of any early termination clauses."
"Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis."
The Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote.
"Merchant Services The Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants, due to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency."
"If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges."
"The ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable Bank of America 2022 181 payment network rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time limits."
"The total amount of transactions subject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the preceding six-month period, which was approximately $501 billion, is an estimate of the Corporations maximum potential exposure as of December 31, 2022."
The Corporations risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery.
"The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants."
The Corporations reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were not significant.
"Exchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees The Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U."
S. and other countries.
"As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios."
"The Corporations potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges and clearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the Corporations contribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund."
"The Corporations maximum potential exposure under these membership agreements is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the probability of making any such payments as remote."
"Prime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services In connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement services with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its clients."
"Under these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to securities transactions."
The Corporations obligations in this respect are secured by the assets in the clients accounts and the accounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the Corporation on behalf of clients or their customers.
"The Corporations maximum potential exposure under these arrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the Corporation to incur material losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote."
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo Program The Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporations rules.
"As part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation."
"The Corporations guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote."
"The Corporations maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $59.6 billion and $42.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"Other Guarantees In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions."
"Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt The Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation."
"Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees The Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans."
"In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans."
"In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies make and have made various representations and warranties."
"Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide indemnification or other remedies to sponsors, investors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases)."
"Unresolved Repurchase Claims Unresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default."
"In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments."
"The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $5.5 billion and $8.4 billion."
"These balances included $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 of claims related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will otherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims paid."
"During 2022, the Corporation received $82 million in new repurchase claims that were not time-barred."
"During 2022, $3.0 billion in claims were resolved."
"Reserve and Related Provision The reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $612 million and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income."
"The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporations best estimate 182 Bank of America 2022 of probable incurred losses, is based on its experience in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known or unknown uncertainties."
"Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity."
See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.
"Litigation and Regulatory Matters In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings."
"In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter."
"As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters below, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods."
"Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of expense."
The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established.
"Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation and regulatory investigation-related expense of $1.2 billion and $164 million was recognized in 2022 and 2021."
"For any matter disclosed in this Note for which a loss in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the Corporations estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $0.8 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of December 31, 2022."
"The accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties."
"The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual."
The estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Corporations maximum loss exposure.
"Information is provided below regarding the nature of the litigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages."
"Based on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described below, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation."
"However, in light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in those matters, some of which are beyond the Corporations control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of those matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of those matters could be material to the Corporations business or results of operations for any particular reporting period, or cause significant reputational harm."
"Deposit Insurance Assessment On January 9, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) filed suit against BANA in the U."
"S. District Court for the District of Columbia (District Court) alleging failure to pay a December 15, 2016 invoice for additional deposit insurance assessments and interest in the amount of $542million for the quarters ending June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014."
"On April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a claim for additional deposit insurance and interest in the amount of $583million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013."
"The FDIC asserts these claims based on BANAs alleged underreporting of counterparty exposures that resulted in underpayment of assessments for those quarters, and its Enforcement Section is also conducting a parallel investigation related to the same alleged reporting error."
BANA disagrees with the FDICs interpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time period and is defending itself against the FDICs claims.
"Pending final resolution, BANA has pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional assessment amounts."
"On March 27, 2018, the District Court denied BANAs partial motion to dismiss certain of the FDICs claims."
"On January 24, 2023, the magistrate judge assigned to the matter by the District Court judge held oral argument on the parties motions for summary judgment and took the motions under advisement."
"LIBOR The Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities have been named as defendants along with most of the other LIBOR panel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions by persons alleging they sustained losses on U."
S. dollar LIBOR- based financial instruments as a result of collusion or manipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.
S. dollar LIBOR.
"Plaintiffs assert a variety of claims, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek compensatory, treble and punitive damages, and injunctive relief."
All but one of the cases naming the Corporation and its affiliates relating to U.
S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.
S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (District Court).
"The District Court has dismissed all RICO claims, and dismissed all manipulation claims against Bank of America entities based on alleged trader conduct."
"The District Court has also substantially limited the scope of antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act and various other claims, including by dismissing in their entirety certain individual and putative class plaintiffs antitrust claims for lack of standing."
"On December 30, 2021, the U."
S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of these antitrust claims for lack of standing.
"Certain individual and putative class actions remain pending against the Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities."
"On February 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a class of persons that purchased OTC swaps and notes that referenced U."

"As a financial holding company, the Corporation is subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the Federal Reserve."
The Corporations banking entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.
"The Corporation and its primary banking entity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3."
"As Advanced approaches institutions, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory risk- based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches."
"The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework."
The Corporation is required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
The Corporations insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.

Bank of America 2022 187 The capital adequacy rules issued by the U.
S. banking regulators require institutions to meet the established minimums outlined in the table above.
Failure to meet the minimum requirements can lead to certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse impact on the Corporations financial position.
"At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates were well capitalized."
"Other Regulatory Matters At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $5.6 billion and $4.0 billion, and securities with a fair value of $16.6 billion and $10.6 billion that were segregated in compliance with securities regulations."
Cash and cash equivalents segregated in compliance with securities regulations are a component of restricted cash.

"NOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans Pension and Postretirement Plans The Corporation sponsors a qualified noncontributory trusteed pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans and postretirement health and life plans that cover eligible employees."
Non-U.
S. pension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the country and local practices.
"The Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account balances with participant-selected investments, applied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan that effectively provides principal protection for participant balances transferred and certain compensation credits."
The Corporation is responsible for funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature.
Benefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have been frozen.
"Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn investment credits or interest credits in accordance with the terms of the plan document."
The Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the payment of benefits vested under a terminated U.
S. pension plan (Other Pension Plan).
"The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for or benefit from actual experience and investment performance of the annuity assets."
The Corporation made no contribution under this agreement in 2022 or 2021.
Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.
"The Corporations noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees."
"In addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefits- eligible employees may become eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored by the Corporation."
These plans are referred to as the Postretirement Health and Life Plans.
"The Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at December 31, 2022 and 2021."
"The estimate of the Corporations PBO associated with these plans considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for mortality rates and discount rates."
The discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique that utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of the plans.
"The increases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2022 resulted in a decrease to the PBO of $5.3 billion at December 31, 2022."
"The increases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2021 resulted in a decrease to the PBO of approximately $895million at December 31, 2021."
Significant gains and losses related to changes in the PBO for 2022 and 2021 primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate.

Gains and losses for all benefit plans except postretirement health care are recognized in accordance with the standard amortization provisions of the applicable accounting guidance.
Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was determined using the projected unit credit actuarial method.
"For the Postretirement Health and Life Plans, 50 percent of the unrecognized gain or loss at the beginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a level basis during the year."
Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans.
"The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans is 6.50 percent for 2023, reducing in steps to 5.00 percent in 2028 and later years."
The Corporations net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the plans is sensitive to the discount rate and expected return on plan assets.

The Corporations policy is to invest the trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration.
"The Corporations investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities."
The strategy attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws.
The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the assets.
"Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change."
Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets.
An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment measures.
The assets of the Non-U.
S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a U.
K. pension plan.
This U.
K. pension plans assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the nature and the duration of the plans liabilities.
The selected asset allocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy.
"The expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis of historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds past experience and expectations on potential future market returns."
The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined using the calculated market-related value for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the Non-U.
S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans.
"The expected return on plan assets assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U."

"NOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation Plans The Corporation administers a number of equity compensation plans, with awards being granted predominantly from the Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan (BACEP)."
"Under this plan, 715 million shares of the Corporations common stock are authorized to be used for grants of awards."
"During 2022 and 2021, the Corporation granted 102 million and 99 million RSU awards to certain employees under the BACEP."
These RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in shares of common stock of the Corporation.
Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these awards to variable accounting whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporations common stock up to the settlement date.
The RSUs granted in 2022 will generally vest over four years.
"Of the RSUs granted in 2021, 81 million will generally vest over four years and 18 million will vest over three years."
"The four-year awards vest primarily in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date while the three-year awards vest primarily in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non- retirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares."
"Of the RSUs granted in 2022 and 2021 that vest over four years, 39 million and 27 million do not include retirement eligibility."
"For all other RSUs granted to employees who are retirement eligible, they are deemed authorized as of the beginning of the year preceding the grant date when the incentive award plans are generally approved."
"As a result, the estimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date."
"The compensation cost for the stock-based plans was $2.9 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.1 billion, and the related income tax benefit was $697 million, $723 million and $505 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively."

"NOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements Under applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date."
The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis.
Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace.
"For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles ."
The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option.
"For more information, see Note 21 Fair Value Option."
Valuation Techniques The following sections outline the valuation methodologies for the Corporations assets and liabilities.
"While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date."
"During 2022, there were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporations consolidated financial position or results of operations."
Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions.
The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets.
Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities.
Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased.
"Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate managements best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates."
Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security.
Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities.
"Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings."
Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the markets perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector.
"In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, Bank of America 2022 195 principally from reviewing the issuers financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies."
"Derivative Assets and Liabilities The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position."
"The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services."
"When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation."
"Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values."
"The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate."
"In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position."
"Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Corporations own credit risk."
The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives.
"An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data."
"Loans and Loan Commitments The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers."
"Results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower."
"Mortgage Servicing Rights The fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs."
This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.
"Loans Held-for-sale The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporations current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk."
The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan performance when selecting comparables.
"Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities."
The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes.
"These models incorporate observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs."
The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value these liabilities.
The credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.
"Securities Financing Agreements The fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors."
"The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services."
"Deposits The fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors."
"The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services."
The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities.
The credit risk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash market.
"Asset-backed Secured Financings The fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporations current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk."
"196 Bank of America 2022 Recurring Fair Value Assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021, including financial instruments that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables."

"Commercial loans, debt securities and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate assets."
Structured liabilities primarily include equity- linked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.
The Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments.
"For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together."
"For a given product, such as corporate debt securities, market comparables may be used to estimate some of the unobservable inputs, and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted cash flow model."
"Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques."
The levels of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability categories.
"Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from Unobservable Inputs Loans and Securities A significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for long positions."
Short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.
"The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested."
"A significant increase in price would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value for long positions, and short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way."
"Structured Liabilities and Derivatives For credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield, upfront points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers."
The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument.
Structured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation.
Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument.
The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche.
"For senior tranches that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value."
Net short protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.
"For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between two different commodities, between two different interest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would have resulted in a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact depend on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure."
"For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value."
"Nonrecurring Fair Value The Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring."
"The amounts below represent assets still held as of the reporting date for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during 2022, 2021, and 2020."

n/a = not applicable NOTE 21 Fair Value Option Loans and Loan Commitments The Corporation elects to account for certain loans and loan commitments that exceed the Corporations single-name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option.
"Lending commitments are actively managed and, as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporations public side credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity."
These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as accounting hedges and are carried at fair value.
"The fair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with managements view of the underlying economics and the manner in which they are managed."
"In addition, the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the credit derivatives at fair value."
"Loans Held-for-sale The Corporation elects to account for residential mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under the fair value option."
"These loans are actively managed and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may be mitigated through the use of derivatives."
"The Corporation has elected not to designate the derivatives as qualifying accounting hedges, and therefore, they are carried at fair value."
The changes in fair value of the loans are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the derivatives.
The fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value.
The Corporation has not elected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair value option primarily because these loans are floating-rate loans that are not hedged using derivative instruments.
Loans Reported as Trading Account Assets The Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value basis under the fair value option.
Other Assets The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate margin loans that are hedged with derivatives under the fair value option.
Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value.
"Securities Financing Agreements The Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option."
These elections include certain agreements collateralized by the U.
"S. government and its agencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal interest rate risk."
204 Bank of America 2022 Long-term Deposits The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value.
The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives.
"Short-term Borrowings The Corporation elects to account for certain short-term borrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the fair value option because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis."
"The Corporation also elects to account for certain asset- backed secured financings, which are also classified in short- term borrowings, under the fair value option."
Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost and the corresponding mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value.
"Long-term Debt The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term debt, primarily structured liabilities, under the fair value option."
This long-term debt is either risk-managed on a fair value basis or the related hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.
"Fair Value Option Elections The following tables provide information about the fair value carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and information about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2022, 2021 and 2020."

The following disclosures include financial instruments that are not carried at fair value or only a portion of the ending balance is carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
"Short-term Financial Instruments The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, certain time deposits placed and other short-term investments, federal funds sold and purchased, certain resale and repurchase agreements and short-term borrowings, approximates the fair value of these instruments."
These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short- term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market.

"For more information on commitments, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies ."
"NOTE 23 Business Segment Information The Corporation reports its results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking , Global Wealth & Investment Management, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other ."
"Consumer Banking Consumer Banking offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses."

S. Consumer Banking includes the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans.
"Global Wealth & Investment Management GWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets, including tailored solutions to meet clients needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products."
"GWIM also provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services."
"Global Banking Global Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services through the Corporations network of offices and client relationship teams."
Global Banking also provides investment banking products to clients.
The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement.
"Global Banking clients generally include middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations, financial institutions, leasing clients, and mid-sized U."

"Global Markets Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses."
"Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities."
Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets.
Global Markets also works with commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products.
"As a result of market- making activities, Global Markets may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products."
"In addition, the economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement."
"All Other All Other primarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment."
ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to the business segments.
Basis of Presentation The management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense.
"The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business."
"Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income."
The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense.
The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income.
The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics.
"In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities."
Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of the Corporations ALM activities.
The Corporations ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of Bank of America 2022 207 various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility.
The Corporations goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.
The results of a majority of the Corporations ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities.
"ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporations internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities."
Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments.
The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.
"Effective October 1, 2021, a business activity previously included in the Global Markets segment is being reported as a liquidating business in All Other , consistent with a realignment in performance reporting to senior management."
"While this activity was not material to Global Markets results of operations and historical results have not been restated, this activitys noninterest expense of $309 million and $473 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021 was elevated and would have been excluded from Global Markets results of operations for those periods under the new basis of presentation."
