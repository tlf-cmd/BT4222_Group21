"More Science Than Art Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) enable the delivery of some of the most advanced DNA-based therapies including mRNA vaccinesand creating them used to be a complicated, time-consuming, and labor-intensive process that resembled art more than science."
"The chemistry was challenging and required years of training and practice, as well as improvisation."
"Consequently, batches of LNPs were inconsistent, making it difficult to produce material suitable for human therapeutic applications."
"Precision Nanosystems revolutionary kit uses scalable microfluidic mixing technologies and unique lipid delivery reagents to produce significantly more stable, reproducible, consistent LNP formulations."
The standardization facilitates reproduction of reliable results during drug discovery and accelerates process development and scale up for clinical application.
"Supporting the Future of Gene Editing Research The future of medicine is in gene editing, but doing so correctly can sometimes produce additional, unintended changes to the genome called off-target effects."
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) award-winning rhAmpSeq CRISPR Analysis System accelerates genome editing research and provides a mechanism to assess on- and off-target editing.
"Its user-friendly interface allows scientists to create workflows that can support CRISPR gene editing project completion in less than a week, and without specialized hardware or bioinformatics knowledgemaking this critical analysis faster and more accessible to more scientists."
"Scaling Up Synthetic Biology with Automation Engineering proteins, synthesizing DNA and cloning molecules require several manual steps that are done at a micro levelcreating opportunities for inconsistency and error."
"Molecular Devices is automating iterative tasks in synthetic biology with the QPix, a specialized robot that selects and isolates colonies of pure, single-strain microbes to mass produce them."
"Unlike error-prone colony picking done by hand, QPix users can objectively select high-performing colonies and generate consistent and traceable data for large numbers of samples in a fraction of the time a manual effort would take."
"IDTs rhAmpSeq CRISPR Analysis System INNOVATION GRI: 203-1, 203-2 SASB: HC-BP-210a.1 UN: SDG 3, 8, 92022 Danaher Sustainability Report21 Powering High-Tech Cell Sorting Cell sorting is an important laboratory process that separates cell types in a sample based on physical or biological properties."
"Cell sorters are used for a wide range of sample analyses and users often have minimal training, so the sorter must be versatile and easy to use."
"With that in mind, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences launched the award-winning CytoFLEX SRT Benchtop Cell Sorter which automates setup and simplifies operation while supporting a wide range of cell sorting needs depending on the scope of research and size of the lab."
This innovative technology enables scientists to focus on their research and spend less time on instrument setup and operation.

Our goal is to become the global leader in connected diagnosticstransforming insights into answers and delivering high quality and accurate diagnostic confidence for a spectrum of critical health conditions.
"Faster and more accurate diagnoses improve patient outcomes through earlier interventions and shortened hospital stays, while also driving efficiencies and conserving precious healthcare resources."
The following examples highlight some of our most impactful diagnostic technologies and solutions.
"Beckman Coulter Diagnostics associate Charmaine Radway Driving Efficiencies in Cardiac Testing Each year, nearly 20 million patients in North America and Europe show up to emergency departments with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)but only 10% end up being diagnosed with a myocardial injury."
The other 18 million patients often receive extensive and unnecessary cardiac workups at a cost of over $4 billion annually.
"Beckman Coulter Diagnostics is addressing this health care inefficiency with its High Sensitivity Troponin I assay (Access hsTnI) and AMI Clinical Decision Support software solution, which quickly and accurately identifies patients with ACS or otherwise at risk for a major adverse cardiovascular event."
"Beckmans solution supports faster intervention for patients with suspected ACS, and more effectively rules out low risk patients, reducing unnecessary testing and shortening aggregate emergency department wait-times by up to 36 million hours each year."
"Setting the Standard for Molecular Diagnostics Innovation Since 2019 Cepheid has doubled its installed base of molecular diagnostic testing systems and today there are more than 40,000 Cepheid GeneXpert and Infinity systems in over 180 countries."
"With a menu of over 35 tests spanning many disease states, Cepheids Lab in a Cartridge technology provides simplified, on-demand access to lab-quality results everywherefrom major city hospitals to local clinics and remote villages."
Cepheids strong track record of innovation has focused on bringing more of this life-changing molecular testing closer to patients to drive better outcomes and standards of care.
"The team continued this important work with the recent global launch of several new womens health and respiratory tests, including the Xpert Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus which returns results in as little as 25 minutes."
"Advancing Cancer Diagnostics and Improving Lives Each year nearly 20 million people around the world receive a devastating cancer diagnosis, a complex process that involves multiple health specialties including lab and pathology professionals, often requiring several weeks for a definitive diagnosis."

"40% 38%TEAM GRI: 102-8, 102-15, 405-1 SASB: TC-HW-330a.1 UN: SDG 5, 8, 102022 Danaher Sustainability Report32D+I Commitment In 2022, we codified our commitment to diversity and inclusion by adopting the DEI Policy."
"The policy articulates the details of our commitment at the enterprise, operating company, people leader and individual contributor levels."
"ENTERPRISE ACCOUNTABILITY Danahers Office of Diversity + Inclusion is led by our Vice President of Global Diversity + Inclusion, who is responsible for the execution of Danahers D+I strategy and reports to Danahers Senior Vice President of Human Resources."
Both leaders serve on the Danaher Diversity + Inclusion Council along with executives who lead our businesses.
"The D+I Council reports to our President and CEO and is responsible for: Overseeing Danahers D+I strategic direction Creating D+I accountability measures, including performance and development objectives Operationalizing D+I initiatives and programming across all our operating companies In addition, Danahers President and CEO is a signatory to the CEO Action for Diversity + Inclusion pledge (CEO Action), setting a clear tone at the top regarding D+Is critical importance to Danaher."
That message is carried through our internal communications and policies as well.
"OPERATING COMPANY ACCOUNTABILITY While we have made tremendous progress across our D+I efforts over the last few years, we feel a sense of urgency to accelerate our work on this front."
"Across Danaher, when we reach for bold objectives we care deeply about, we turn to a DBS tool called Policy Deployment (PD)."
"Starting in 2021, each of our operating companies added an annual PD initiative focused on D+I."
"PD helps our operating companies determine their critical few improvement priorities and achieve strategic breakthroughs through the implementation of new, sustainable processes."
"PDs rigorous plan-do-check-adjust approach is helping us increase the pace and traction of our diversity representation, engagement and inclusion goals, as evidenced by the metrics shown on the previous page."
"Leadership Commitment to D+I As we continue to mature and evolve in our D+I journey across Danaher, we are particularly focused on people leader accountability."
"In 2022, for the third year in a row, Danaher is requiring each people leader to have a D+I-related personal performance or development objective as part of our annual review process, Performance for Growth (P4G)."
"Ensuring our leaders understand the importance of D+I, model an inclusive culture through their own behaviors and cultivate opportunities for their teams to learn and engage is critical in advancing our D+I goals."
Our annual Day of Understanding (DoU) is an important tool that our people leaders use to engage their teams in meaningful discussions around D+I topics.
DoU is an event created by CEO Action to stimulate opportunities for addressing potential bias in the workplace and fostering a culture of inclusion and understanding.
"Nearly 93% of our people leaders hosted sessions with their teams in 2021, focusing on one of two topics: Micro-Behaviors & Bias and Examining Identities and Intersectionality."
Our 2022 DoU will focus on Persons with Disabilities.
Pay Equity Our DEI Policy articulates our commitment to pay equity (including gender and racial/ethnic group pay equity) and ensuring that pay decisions are based on merit.
"We proactively monitor, measure and review our pay practices and take actions toward achieving and maintaining pay equity."
"In 2020, we achieved base pay equity for women and for racial and ethnic minorities in the U."
S. based on an analysis of weighted median base pay.
"In 2021, we expanded this analysis in the U."
"S. to include both base pay and short-term incentive compensation (STI), and our results continue to demonstrate pay equity."
The weighted median base pay and STI for women in the U.
S. is 100% of the weighted median base pay and STI of men within operating companies in the same job.
"Black, Asian and Latinx associates in the U."
S. have a weighted median base pay and STI that is at least 100% of the weighted median base pay and STI of white associates within operating companies in the same job.
Outside the U.
"S., we conduct pay gap reporting by operating company in the countries where this is required, and we have voluntarily performed detailed pay fairness analyses in ten of our most populous countriescovering more than 75% of our global headcount."
We intend to include additional countries in our 2022 pay fairness work to reach 95% of our global headcount and continue to strive toward achieving pay equity in each country where we do business.
Recent Recognition We are grateful for the recognition we have received for our D+I achievements and progress so far.
"For the twelfth year in a row, in 2022 the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index named Danaher one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality, and each year since 2014 we have received a perfect score of 100."

"S., with an annual competition that features more than 147,000 student inventions from across the country."
"In 2022, Danaher scientists and engineers served as judges, applying their scientific expertise to review student submissions."
"Danaher was the presenting sponsor of the Conventions Health and Medical Award, which recognizes a notable student who successfully addresses a health and medical technology problem that could one day save lives."
"The 2022 winner and scholarship recipient was Dylan, a fifth grader from Redondo Beach, CA, for the Tasty IV Flush, a flavored pellet that makes saline solution taste better, creating a more positive patient experience."
"Patients undergoing continuous IV treatments need to have their IV line flushed with a saline solution, which can be tasted by the patient."
"Dylans mom had recently undergone cancer treatment, and a friend had been treated for hemophilia."
"Their shared negative experience tasting salty metal during saline flush inspired him to develop better, custom options."
"As Dylan told the judges, Research supports a lot of people have this problem, and it impacts how they react to treatment."
I tried different flavors mixed with a saline solution and surveyed my family and friends to see which flavors they liked best.
"The idea is that a patient could pick a flavor from all the options, and it would taste like they had a candy in their mouth during treatment and they would have a better experience."
Mentorship in Action City Year UK is an education and youth social action charity that challenges 18- to 25-year-olds to tackle educational inequality through a year of full-time voluntary service.

This work has a remarkable double benefit.

I couldnt answer.
He helped me find a balance with working in a creative industrywhich has been a passion of mineand focusing on my strengths and where I can continue to grow as a person.
Having Samit as my mentor made me more confident and the knowledge he imparted will always stay with me.

"REDUCTION IN SCOPE 1 AND 2 GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTION IN PERCENTAGE OF WASTE SENT TO LANDFILL OR INCINERATION50.4% 15%In this report, we are announcing our intention to reduce Danahers Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50.4% on an absolute basis by 2032 (compared to a baseline year of 2021)a reduction target that aligns to the prevailing climate science goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels."
"We are developing a suite of tools and processes to drive this effort, with the DBS Energy Management Toolkit as our foundation."
"This new, science-aligned goal supersedes our prior intensity-based GHG and energy reduction targets and represents an even more ambitious reduction goal."
"In 2020, we announced a five-year goal to reduce the percentage of non-hazardous/non-regulated waste sent to landfill or incineration by 15%."
"With the DBS Waste Minimization Toolkit as the cornerstone, in 2021 we reduced the percentage of non-hazardous/non-regulated waste sent to landfill by 10% compared to the 2019 baseline."
* We also track a range of EHS-related KPIs to measure the effectiveness of our program and quantify our progress.
These are provided in the data summary at the end of this report.

"The DBS Energy Management Toolkit guides facility- level teams in identifying, prioritizing and implementing measures that improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions."
Our teams use the toolkit to establish a thorough understanding of energy consumption and identify areas for improvement in the form of an opportunity assessment.
"Next, the teams develop energy management action plans to be implemented using a variety of DBS tools, based on the following framework: Envision Collect and analyze data relating to electricity and natural gas usage, air line leaks, insulation and fuel types."
Establish long-term and short-term reduction goals.
Establish clear roles and responsibilities.
"Investigate Go to gembathe physical location where work gets doneto identify and map all systems, processes and pieces of equipment that use electricity, natural gas, other forms of fuel or air, or contain insulation."
Use the guidelines and checklists in the Toolkit to identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement and develop an action plan.
Implement Systematically execute the action plan.
Measure the impact and track results.
"Sustain Monitor performance at regular intervals, keep stakeholders engaged and add new opportunities for impact to the action plan."
We first introduced the DBS Waste Minimization Toolkit in 2020.
"Facility-level teams use the tool to evaluate waste generation and disposal practices, identify improvement opportunities, develop action plans and implement comprehensive waste minimization strategies."
"The toolkit follows the waste management hierarchy of controls: avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle, recover energy, treat and dispose."
"Given the essential role Danaher plays in the water ecosystem, assessing water risk in our operations and supply chain is critical."
We use the World Resource Institutes Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas to assess the level of water risk at each of our sites worldwide.
"We are also leveraging the power of DBS to develop the Water Stewardship Toolkit, which we are piloting in 2022."
"This toolkit is intended to guide facility-level teams in identifying, prioritizing and implementing measures that improve water use efficiency and optimize re-use."
"The toolkit is also intended to facilitate a business- focused review of water-related market, reputational and operational risks, prioritize sites based on water consumption and water basin risks, and rank potential projects for implementation."
The application of these tools is supported by a specially trained group of associates referred to as Certified Practitioners (CP) and Advanced Certified Practitioners (ACP).
"Qualifying as a CP or an ACP requires a training process that extends up to 18 months and includes classroom instruction as well as practical, experiential learning."
"Other EHS Management Tools A number of our sites also adhere to globally recognized EHS management systems, including ISO 14001 (environmental), ISO 45001 (health and safety) and ISO 50001 (energy management): NUMBER OF EHS SIGNIFICANT SITES ADHERING TO EHS ISO STANDARDS ISO 14001 ISO 45001 ISO 50001 56 19 5 (all data as of December 31, 2021) Note: Total number of EHS significant manufacturing and assembly sites globally was 149 as of the end of 2021."
"Danaher defines EHS significant sites as manufacturing, assembly, laboratory, research, testing, maintenance and/or warehouse facilities with a population of 25 associates or greater, or with particular inherent EHS hazards."
"2015 Launch of 4E EHS Hazard Control Toolkit.2016 Introduced layered, EHS self-audits and kamishibai, a DBS virtual tool that helps sustain operational safety, good housekeeping, and fire protection systems and control.2017 Introduced leading EHS indicators, such as near misses and safety observations, into our Daily Management process to reduce exposure to hazards in our workspace."

"ENVIRONMENT GRI: 302-4, 303-1, 305-5, 403-1, 403-2, 403-5 UN: SDG 12, 132022 Danaher Sustainability Report46EHS Information Management System We use a third party EHS information management system, Benchmark ESG, to collect and manage EHS information globally, including: EHS incident, severity, investigation and corrective action tracking EHS performance metric reporting and tracking Sustainability-related metric reporting and tracking An activity calendar for managing compliance and other recurring tasks Tracking the remediation of incident, audit and inspection findings EHS Risk Assessment We revised our EHS risk assessment process in 2021 to place greater emphasis on the strategy and cultural aspects of EHS."
"Now called the EHS Maturity Assessment Tool (MAT), this tool scores a site against five major elements (strategy, risk management & compliance, DBS, organization and culture) and eleven sub-elements."
"Sites move through beginner, foundational, mature and advanced process maturity phases as they develop, implement and sustain key MAT requirements."
The MAT requires senior leaders and EHS personnel of in-scope sites to set annual goals and three-year improvement targets.
Leadership at both the Danaher and operating company levels reviews progress against these goals and targets multiple times each year.
"Each year, we recognize the global Best EHS program within our organization."
"Sites are evaluated based on several categories, including: EHS MAT score Incident frequency and severity rates Regulatory notices of violations/fines On-time closure of audit findings DBS tool deployment Environmental sustainability performance Property risk protectionEHS Training, Education and Best Practice Sharing In 2022, we expanded our EHS awareness training to cover a wider variety of EHS topics and target a broader audience of associates."
"This annual training is designed to help ensure an understanding of EHS compliance obligations and actively promote an EHS culture of accountability and engagement and covers EHS topics such as safety as a priority, common hazards, managing risks, workplace violence and incident/ accident protocols."
"In 2021, we also established an EHS Community of Practice (CoP) to better leverage the collective EHS leadership talent and domain expertise within Danahers global organization."
"The CoP meets on a regular basis to share best practices, help drive Danahers EHS strategy and provide opportunities for professional development."
"In 2021, the Beckman Coulter Life Sciences plant in Suzhou, China won the EHS Best Plant award."
"DBS Tools including Action Plans, Visual and Daily Management helped the team execute their EHS strategy, advance the sites EHS maturity assessment scores and improve property risk scores."
"Talent The team focused on EHS talent development, creating associate participation and certification opportunities in EHS risk identification and control."
"Results The addition of a new reagent production line in 2020 initially increased the sites year-over-year absolute energy consumption by 50% vs. 2019, but the teams focus on environmental sustainability helped them to ultimately deliver a 30% reduction in 2021 vs. 2019while still successfully growing the business."
"EHS Audit Program In 2022, we updated our EHS audit process, with the goal of further enhancing our strong foundation of EHS compliance."
"Our updated audit process uses internal and external EHS auditing expertise and combines focused self-assessments with risk-based, on-site auditing by Danaher and independent third parties."
"The audit process covers jurisdiction-specific EHS regulatory requirements, with the objectives of identifying and correcting deficiencies as well as identifying and sharing best practices."
Approximately 25% of our EHS significant sites undergo an in-person EHS audit each calendar year.
"Any observed deficiencies are documented, communicated to site leadership and tracked by corporate EHS to ensure timely closure."
"Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Suzhou, China ENVIRONMENT GRI: 205-1, 403-1, 403-2, 403-52022 Danaher Sustainability Report47Our Operating Companies Lead the Way Below we share a few examples of the ways our operating companies are leveraging our EHS management tools and resources to drive meaningful operational change."
"Driving Energy Efficiency in Operations Since 2019, Pall Life Sciences has held 15 environmental sustainability kaizens and implemented over 90 improvement projects yielding total reductions of over 11,000 megawatt hours of energy consumption and 4,800 metric tons of CO2 emissionsthe equivalent of $1.6 million in total savings."
"In 2021, Pall Life Sciences spent 13% less per revenue dollar on energy, gas and water compared to 2019."
"Beckman Coulter Life Sciences reduced CO2 emissions by more than 25% per revenue dollar in 2021 vs. 2019 by deploying automated building management systems, converting to LED lighting and investing in high-efficiency HVAC systems."
"Through a combination of energy kaizens and procuring renewable electricity from our suppliers, Leica Microsystems reduced absolute CO2 emissions by more than 30% in 2021 vs. 2019.Generating Energy On-Site Leica Microsystems facility in Wetzlar, Germany features an on-site natural gas combined heat and power (CHP) plant that supplies one-third of the facilitys annual electricity requirements (approximately 1,300 megawatt hours) as well as heat for the facility."
"Hachs facility in Berlin, Germany has installed a natural gas CHP plant, which provides heat for the facility while recovering electricity."
This achieves nearly 100% fuel efficiency as the system recovers both thermal and mechanical energy from fuel combustion.
"Reducing Waste In 2021, Leica Microsystems became the first Danaher operating company to be 100% landfill free reaching zero waste to landfill in non-hazardous waste operations."
All Leica Microsystems non-hazardous waste streams are sent to recycling or incineration with energy recovery (where heat and/or electricity is generated from waste combustion).
"As an early leader in circular economy, the Hach Environmental Center in Dusseldorf, Germany has been recycling used reagents from our customers since 1978."
The facility accepts around 350 metric tons of returned reagents and packaging materials every year and recycles approximately 75% of these reagents and materials.
"The Hach Environmental Center was one of the early winners of the German Sustainability Award, in 2009."
"In tandem with Pall Life Sciences tremendous business growth, the team has successfully reduced the percentage of non-hazardous/non-regulated waste sent to landfill from 43% in 2019 to 31% in 2021."
Pall Life Sciences deployed the DBS Waste Minimization Toolkit and held six waste minimization kaizens across Pall sites in 2021.
"SCIEX used the DBS Waste Minimization toolkit to identify an 86% reduction in landfill waste and, through collaboration with waste vendors, the team reduced non-hazardous waste sent to landfill by 54% compared to 2019."
"Deploying DBS to Reduce Water Consumption Cytivas site in Tonglu, China received water saving exemplary enterprise recognition from Zhejiang Province in 2021."
"Over the last few years, the site has invested more than $3 million to improve water efficiency and has reduced annual water consumption by more than 80% since 2016.Cytivas facility in Uppsala, Sweden Operationalizing Sustainability at Cytiva Cytivas manufacturing facility in Uppsala, Sweden has invested over $4 million since 2019 toward sustainability initiatives including reducing water consumption and waste, energy recycling, and converting to renewable energy via solar panels."
"These initiatives encourage a sustainable mindset for all associates, showing its possible to produce the same high-quality products with fewer resources and waste."
"The site turns resin manufacturing waste into biogas, which is used to fuel the local municipal bus fleet."
"In 2021, Cytiva generated enough biogas to fuel two bus trips around the globe."
A water reduction program helped the team reduce the amount of water used for resin production by approximately 25% in 2021 vs. 2019.
"With learnings from the pilot, Cytiva is working to replicate this process across other on-site production processes."
SITE RESULTS SINCE 2019: Conducted 46 improvement projects focused on water savings Water efficiency +33% Energy efficiency +18% Total CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) -22% Equivalent of $2 million of annual cost savingsENVIRONMENT UN: SDG 62022 Danaher Sustainability Report48Helping Our Customers Reduce Their Environmental Impact Below we share a few examples of the ways our operating companies innovative technologies are helping customers reduce their environmental impact.
"Reducing Waste Through Packaging and Pallet Optimization Eskos Cape Pack package design and pallet optimization software helps customers maximize the number of boxes per pallet and truckload, reducing storage and transportation needs and ultimately reducing their environmental impact."
"In one application, Cape Pack facilitated changes to truck pallet height that increased the number of products per truck."
"This eliminated the need for 18,100 trucks on the road, 10,000 gallons of gasoline and 909,000 trucking milesequivalent to two round trips to the moonand saved 3.4 million pounds of CO2."
"In another application, Cape Pack facilitated the replacement of shipping cases with trays that held 30% more product per pallet, reducing the customers paper consumption by over 23 tons."
"Supporting Environmental Protection and Conservation Oceans, seas and coastal areas cover more than two-thirds of the Earths surface and play a critical role in the health of our planet."
The data gathered from Sea-Bird Scientifics oceanographic instruments are key tools used across numerous international programs to better understand these vital ecosystems.
International maritime agencies including the U.
"S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration rely on these instruments for accurate and actionable data to better understand weather patterns, changes in ocean environments, and the implications of climate change."
"Reducing Water Waste at Breweries Water scarcity is a looming existential threat, as only 3% of the Earths water is freshwater."
"As global breweries shift toward sustainable beer production, reducing water consumption has become a key goal."
Palls membrane filtration systems require fewer processing steps and generate higher clean water yield than conventional water treatment filters.
"By reducing the amount of water retained in the filter, which is not recoverable, Palls membrane filter systems can reduce water consumption by up to 75% compared to conventional filters."
"Extending Product Life Span to Minimize Waste Chromatography columns are essential for separating, purifying and quantifying impurities and metabolites in pharmaceutical and biologic drugs."
"When a chromatography column exceeds its life span, it loses stability, causing faulty separation of biological samples."
Phenomenexs Biozen Size Exclusion Chromatography Column dSEC-2 has a life span up to 50% longer than other columns on the market.
"As a result, two Biozen dSEC-2 columns can do the job previously done by three, producing less waste and minimizing chromatography replacement time and costs."
"Making Zero Water Factories Possible To address global water scarcity and improve the sustainability of its operations, a global dairy company is working to eliminate water consumption and waste in its factories around the world."
"With the help of Hach, Trojan and Hexis, two facilities in Brazil are now zero water factories."
"A key element of the zero water process involves extracting water from milk during the condensing process, which uses Trojans Aquafine UV disinfection system and the Hach BioTector TOC Analyzer to ensure the quality of the extracted water is high enough to reuse."
"These factories no longer consume water from the municipal supply or produce wastewater that must be treated by municipal systems and released into local waterwaysa savings of more than 175,000m3 of water per year in each facility."
Award Winning Water Treatment Solutions The annual U.
"S. Federal Energy and Water Management Awards recognize outstanding contributions in the areas of energy and water efficiency, resilience and technology achievements."
"ChemTreats advanced water treatment program was recognized for helping The National Institutes of Health (NIH) save 28 million gallons of water and 55.9 billion Btu of natural gas in 2020, in addition to generating nearly $1 million in savings and promoting reliability, safety and regulatory compliance."

"These include the ethics and compliance systems described in this report and, in some cases, the use of data analytics to identify and mitigate risks."
We look to industry best practices and benchmarks to track our performance against our peers.
"Danahers ethics and compliance team works closely with the legal, human resources, internal audit, finance and other functions at all levels of our organization to monitor and help ensure ethical business practices."
Measuring Associates Ethics and Compliance Performance Every Danaher associate is personally accountable for following our ethics and compliance policies.
Instills Trust is one of the four Core Behaviors that guide the annual performance reviews that are part of our P4G program.
"This Core Behavior emphasizes maintaining Danahers core ethics and values, conducting oneself with humility and cultivating a culture of transparency."
Associates self-assess and managers numerically score associate performance with respect to this element annually.
The Core Behavior score an associate receives directly impacts their compensation.
"Assessing Associate Trust in the Ethics and Compliance Culture Every year, we ask Danaher associates to rate our ethics and compliance culture as part of our Engagement Survey."
"Leaders across our platforms and operating companies leverage those results to develop action plans and drive improvement, as necessary."
"People leaders have heightened responsibility to promote a culture of integrity, transparency and humility."
"As part of our annual Engagement Survey, associates have the opportunity to quantitatively and qualitatively rate their managers performance on the Instills Trust Core Behavior."
Managers receive this feedback and create action plans to address opportunities to improve.

"However, the Board also seeks to thoughtfully balance the knowledge and experience that comes from longer-term Board service with the fresh perspectives and new domain expertise that can come from adding new directors."
"We have added five new directors to our Board in the past three years, helping reduce our average director tenure by more than 20% from 2019 to 2022."
Diversity is a critical dimension of our focus on Board composition and refreshment.
"Our Board believes that it should collectively embody a diverse set of skills, knowledge, experiences and backgrounds appropriate to the companys needs, and as a result it takes into account racial/ethnic, gender, age and national origin diversity when considering director nominees."
Our Boards current composition demonstrates the D+I progress we have achieved.
Today 29% of Danahers Board is female; two of our key Board leadership positions (Lead Independent Director and Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee) are held by a female director; 27% of our independent directors are under the age of 50; four of our directors were born outside the U.
"S.; and our Board includes a Black director and directors of Asian, Middle Eastern and North African descent."
"The table to the right illustrates the diverse set of skills, expertise and backgrounds represented on our Board (as of August 1, 2022)."

"The foundation of the long-term CEO succession planning process is a CEO development model consisting of three dimensions: critical experiences, leadership capabilities and personal characteristics/traits."
"The Board uses the development model as a guide in preparing candidates, and also in evaluating candidates for the CEO and other executive positions at the Boards annual talent review and succession planning session."
"At the annual session, the Board evaluates and compares candidates using the development model, and reviews each candidates development actions, progress and performance over time."
"The candidate evaluations are supplemented with periodic 360-degree performance appraisals, and the Board also regularly interacts with candidates at Board dinners and lunches, through Board meeting presentations and at the Companys annual leadership conference."
"Managing Potential Conflicts of Interest Danahers Nominating and Governance Committee reviews and, if appropriate, approves related person transactions prior to consummation."
Related person transactions of an ongoing nature are reviewed annually by the Committee.

The list to the right includes examples of the types of risks we assess in each of the five pillars.

Our annual Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program is the key management program that underpins our risk oversight function.
The goal of our ERM program is to comprehensively inventory and mitigate key risks across all of Danahers platforms and operating companies.
The risk data collected is used to support effective business decision-making and assess risk-reward tradeoffs.
It also gives our leadership visibility into key existing and emerging business risks and countermeasures and enables us to mitigate risks as dictated by our risk-reward assessment.
"As a result, Danaher and its operating companies are able to build better, more resilient businesses supported by a risk-based approach."
"Enterprise Risk Management Methodology At the beginning of the annual ERM process, our corporate risk management function communicates the key elements of the ERM program to our platforms and operating companies, highlighting any year-over-year changes."
"Key program elements include: An inventory and classification of key risk areas and key risk topics A methodology for scoring risks based on the risks probability, severity and velocity of impact, and for trending key risks A framework for developing countermeasures for key risks A process for assigning responsibility and deadlines for the implementation of countermeasures, and re-assessing such risks following implementation of the applicable countermeasures A timeline for collection and synthesis of the risk assessment data and reporting of key risks and countermeasures to the Danaher Risk Committee and the Danaher Board of Directors ERM-specific DBS tools, including an action plan template and a methodology for identifying fundamental elements, establishing the jumping off point and tracking planned vs. actual improvements each month Risk Oversight RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS Each operating company assesses its respective risks using the prescribed methodology and communicates the results to its respective platform risk committee."
The strength of our ERM program lies in the autonomy we give our operating companies to think broadly about the risks they face and determine how best to mitigate them.
We know that those who are closest to gemba are best positioned to identify and mitigate our most significant risks.
"Each platform risk committee reviews and synthesizes the results from its operating companies, identifies key themes, ensures appropriate risk prioritization and communicates its results to the Danaher Risk Committee, which consists of Danahers General Counsel, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Head of Internal Audit, Deputy General Counsel and Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer."
"The Danaher Risk Committee reviews the results, holds discussions with the leadership of each platform and presents a final report to the Danaher Board of Directors annually."
Danahers General Counsel (the executive with management-level responsibility for our ERM program) also updates the Audit Committee of the Board on a periodic basis regarding Danahers ERM processes.
"The Boards role in risk oversight is consistent with Danahers leadership structure: management has day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing Danahers risk exposure, and the Board and its Audit Committee oversee those efforts, with emphasis on our most significant risks."

"Our commitment to cybersecurity emphasizes cultivating a security-minded culture through security education and training, and a programmatic and layered approach that reflects industry best practice."
"We have adopted a comprehensive Information Security Policy that clearly articulates Danahers expectations and requirements with respect to acceptable use, risk management, data privacy, education and awareness, security incident management and reporting, identity and access management, third-party management, security (with respect to physical assets, products, networks and systems), security monitoring and vulnerability identification."
"The policy sets forth a detailed security incident management and reporting protocol, with clear escalation timelines and responsibilities."
We also maintain a global incident response plan (including both proactive and reactive measures) and regularly conduct exercises to help ensure its effectiveness and our overall preparedness.
We believe cybersecurity is the responsibility of every associate.
We regularly educate and share best practices with our associates to raise awareness of cyber threats.
"Every year, all associates in-scope for the Annual Training Program are required to take information security and protection training and (in most countries where we operate) are required to certify their awareness of and compliance with the Information Security Policy."
"We also conduct monthly education, training and cyber-event simulations for our associates."
"We take measures to regularly improve and update our cybersecurity program, including independent program assessments, penetration testing and scanning of our systems for vulnerabilities."
"The cybersecurity program is led by Danahers Chief Information Security Officer, who along with our Chief Information Officer, provide multiple updates each year to the Audit Committee regarding this program, including information about cyber-risk management governance and the status of projects to strengthen cybersecurity effectiveness."
"The Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these matters, and the full Board also receives periodic briefings from management on our cybersecurity program."
"We also updated our disclosure controls and procedures to specifically address cybersecurity risk, including by amending Danahers Insider Trading Policy to address cybersecurity and by ensuring clear linkage between our Disclosure Committee and Chief Information Security Officer."
"Moraine Lake in Banff National Park, Canada by Alina Chernin, Danaher Corporate associateFOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS GRI: 102-15, 102-29, 102-302022 Danaher Sustainability Report69 With our global physical footprint, a key climate related risk for Danaher is physical risk resulting from acute or chronic changes in climate patterns."
"Acute physical risks include increased severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes and floods."
"Chronic physical risks refer to longer-term shifts in climate patterns (such as sustained higher temperatures) that may result in rising sea levels (which could impact our facilities in coastal areas), droughts and heat waves."
"These physical risks may have financial implications for Danaher, such as direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption."
"In the Protecting Our Environment section of this report, we discuss steps Danaher has taken to mitigate the potential impact of these types of physical risks to facilities as well as our efforts to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions."
Key climate-related opportunities for Danaher include the prospect of developing new commercial solutions to address customers sustainability related needs and potentially reduce our operating costs.
"Given that Customers Talk, We Listen is a Danaher Core Value, customer feedback regarding sustainability requirements has been and will continue to be an innovation driver for Danaher."
This report includes examples of innovative products and solutions that directly incorporate customer feedback to address sustainability-specific needs.
"In addition, Danahers businesses are increasingly focused on improving efficiency across our production and distribution processes, production assets, buildings and transport/mobility in relation to energy and water consumption and waste generation."
This report also includes examples where our operating companies have quantified cost savings from environmental impact reduction initiatives.
"Danahers energy and GHG emission reduction targets, and targets to reduce the percentage of waste sent to landfills or incinerators, are helping accelerate these efforts."
"Foundation Climate Risks and Opportunities In 2022, Danaher began piloting a management program to identify, assess and manage climate risks and opportunities based on elements of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)."
"Danaher anticipates that the 2022 pilot will cover businesses representing approximately 15% of our 2021 revenues, with further scope expansion planned for 2023."
"Below is a summary of the pilot program: The program is designed to run parallel to our annual ERM process and would require each in-scope operating company to identify (and score the severity, probability and velocity of) each key climate-related risk, over short- medium- and long-term time horizons."
"For each identified risk that exceeds a prescribed score, the operating company would be required to identify the anticipated business and financial impact of the risk and planned countermeasures."
"Because the climate-related risk assessment uses the same scoring methodology as (and runs parallel to) the annual ERM process, the relative significance and prioritization of climate-related risks would be assessed relative to wider business risks."
"The program would also require identification (and scoring) of each key climate-related opportunity, over short- medium- and long-term time horizons."
"For each identified opportunity that exceeds a prescribed score, the operating company would be required to identify any plans to capitalize on it."
"In addition, in line with the TCFD recommendations to disclose metrics and targets used to assess and manage climate-related risks, we disclose our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and reduction goals in this report."
The results of the program would be presented annually to the Danaher Risk Committee and to Danahers Board of Directors or the applicable committee of the Board.
Danaher anticipates reporting on any key climate- related risks and opportunities identified as a result of this process in our annual sustainability report.
"Danaher has previously identified the following high- level climate-related risks and opportunities: Midnight Sun in Lidingo, Sweden by Greg Beuneu, Cytiva associate GRI: 102-15, 102-29, 102-30, 201-2 TCFD: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management UN: SDG 132022 Danaher Sustainability Report70Political Matters In all communications, associates must make clear that political views and actions are their own and not those of Danaher."
"Associates may never use Danaher resources to contribute to, support or oppose any political party or candidate unless approved by Danaher Corporations Board of Directors or a committee of the Board."
"Supervisors should not solicit direct or indirect reports to contribute to, support or oppose any political party or candidate."
Associates may never make a charitable or political contribution with the intent to improperly influence someone.
Trade/Industry Associations Danaher belongs to and pays dues to certain U.
S. trade and industry associations.
