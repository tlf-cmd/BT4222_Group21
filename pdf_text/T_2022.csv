Connected Climate Initiative Focus AreasKPIs AT&T ESG SUMMARY REPORT 2022 AT&T ESG SUMMARY REPORT 2022 32 33 Transitioning to a low-emissions fleet More than 52% of our Scope 1 emissions come from our ground vehicle fleet.
"We expect to lower fleet emissions at least 76% by 2035 (2015 base year) by implementing technologies such as IoT to maximize vehicle efficiency and optimize routes, as well as customer self-service solutions that can minimize the need to dispatch technician vehicles."
"Through the end of 2021, our fleet emissions have decreased 131,386 MT CO2e down 20.6% from our 2015 base year."
We achieved these reductions despite expanding our ground fleet to support the build-out of our fiber and 5G networks.23 Were reducing vehicle count in targeted portions of our fleet and plan to incorporate hybrid/electric technician vehicles to cut our emissions and reduce pollution in the communities where we operate.
"As part of these preparations, in 2020 AT&T became a founding member of the Corporate Electric Vehicles Alliance, working with other companies to identify the challenges and opportunities involved in adding electric fleet vehicles."
"In 2021, we formed an internal cross-departmental committee to collaboratively advance our fleet vehicle strategy."
"We began developing an Electric Vehicle (EV) Transition Master Plan that will map expected progress over the next 10 years, identify needed utility upgrades and site-specific readiness efforts and inform the procurement of EV supply equipment and EVs."
AT&T is the 7th largest corporate renewable energy user Our commitment to net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions includes increasing our investments in power purchase agreements with renewable energy developers.
"These commitments help reduce our reported emissions and protect against rising energy costs, while adding clean electricity to the U."
S. power grid.
"In 2022, we announced 2 new solar energy deals, increasing our domestic commitments to more than 1.7 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity helping make AT&T the 7th largest corporate renewable energy user in the U."
"S., according to the EPA Green Power Partnership ."
"In Mexico, were implementing a 40 GWh/year agreement to supply renewable energy to approximately 1,200 network sites."
Renewable energy agreements have benefits beyond emissions reductions.
"Our investments create jobs, drive local economic development and improve the communities we serve."
"ENVIRONMENT TOWARD CARBON NEUTRALITY AT&T is working to reduce our GHG emissions by enhancing operational efficiency, reducing energy use and increasing our renewable energy commitments."
"Were committed to becoming carbon neutral, achieving net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2035."
"Our carbon neutral ambition is underpinned by our Climate Strategy & Transition Plan, which guides our work to reduce emissions across all areas of our business."
"Weve also launched a science-based target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 63% by 2030 (2015 base year) aligning with a 1.5C pathway.4 Between 20152021, we reduced reported Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 37.2%, reaching nearly 59% attainment toward our 2030 target."
"Our efforts to improve energy efficiency (page 35) also influence water use, given the water requirements of our cooling equipment."
"We track water use at our facilities using the AT&T Water Scorecard, which helps identify water-saving opportunities (page 36)."
"Leadership accountability for carbon neutrality Annual performance objectives for our Chief Sustainability Officer, AVP Global Environmental Sustainability and other senior leaders across our business include progress toward our carbon neutral goal, science-based targets and other climate- related objectives."
This means our leading environmental initiatives are considerations when determining annual merit salary increases and bonus awards for these individuals.
"Optimizing energy efficiency Energy efficiency is an important part of our net zero strategy, because Scope 2 GHG emissions derived from sources such as purchased electricity account for the majority of our total emissions footprint."
"Our focus on energy efficiency has delivered consistent reductions in carbon emissions, while contributing cost savings to the business."
"Our energy management efforts focus on 3 pillars: Reductions and right-sizing: eliminating unnecessary load by removing obsolete assets and properly diminishing capacity commensurate with demand Optimization : incorporating energy-efficient systems and practices into infrastructure and monitoring performance to address maintenance deficiencies and opportunities Investment : purchasing large-scale renewable energy contracts that deliver clean energy to local grids and reduce our reported Scope 2 emissions For over a decade, weve invested in energy efficiency initiatives such as the ongoing integration of our centrally-managed Energy and Building Management Solution that have made a measurable impact on our energy use."
"Between 2010-2021, weve implemented more than 151,000 energy efficiency projects resulting in annualized savings of nearly 8.1 billion kWh and annualized energy cost savings of more than $735.5 million."
"Toward carbon neutrality Read more: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Issue Brief Energy Management Issue Brief Climate Strategy & Transition Plan Climate Change Issue Brief TCFD Report SASB Index In addition to reducing our emissions footprint, AT&T is investing in renewable energy because it is good for the planet and good for our business."

ENVIRONMENT WASTE MANAGEMENT Water is a shared resource thats vital for environmental sustainability and economic prosperity.
"AT&T focuses on water efficiency to reduce costs and enhance our resilience, and to help preserve the availability of water in our communities."
Water is a critical input for our operations.
53% of our domestic water consumption occurs at locations where most of the water usage helps maintain the controlled and cooled environment required by our communications network.
25 We track water use and savings opportunities at our facilities with the AT&T Water Scorecard.
"We consolidate or reduce building space, where feasible, which has reduced water consumption by 267 million gallons since 2013."
"Our efforts to improve energy efficiency (page 35), such as enhancements to cooling systems, also positively impact our water use."
Water recycling efforts At Warner Bros.
"Studios8 in Burbank, CA, we use recycled water for landscape irrigation and in select cooling towers."
"Since 2013, the Studios have reduced potable water consumption 42%, conserving 232.19 million gallons."
Weve incorporated smart irrigation and rainwater collection systems into the AT&T Discovery District housing our Dallas headquarters.
"Our headquarters building also has a water harvesting system that collects and filters condensate from our air conditioning systems, for landscape irrigation."
"In 2021, this harvesting system saved more than 664,000 gallons of water."
"These water savings efforts helped the AT&T Discovery District earn SITES Silver certification, which recognizes sustainable and resilient land development projects."
AT&T is committed to reducing and responsibly handling the waste we produce from our operations and the products we sell.
"Our operations generate various types of waste including general solid waste, e-waste, retired network infrastructure and office furnishings, and hazardous waste."
"Our approach to waste management involves reuse and recycling programs, as well as initiatives to reduce our overall waste footprint."
"In 2021, we collaborated with third-party waste vendors to expand our pilot IoT-enabled dumpster monitoring program."
"The program uses sensors to inform our waste vendors when dumpsters are full, eliminating pick-up of partial loads."
"By routing trucks to dumpsters only when necessary, were minimizing disposal costs and reducing hauling-related carbon emissions."
"Our 30x30 initiative Based upon learnings from our previous 100-facility zero waste program, in 2021 we set an expanded goal to reduce the amount of U."
S. waste sent to landfill 30% by 2030 (2019 base year).
"This 30x30 initiative addresses our entire waste footprint across more than 3,000 sites and is anticipated to exceed the impact of our 100-facility effort by 104 times, based on weight."
"In 2021, our landfill footprint decreased 26.5% from our 2019 base year achieving 89% of our 30x30 goal."
"Keeping consumer e-waste from landfill We believe all electronic devices should be reused, refurbished or recycled."
We work to keep electronic materials out of landfill through reuse programs including a free portal where customers can recycle old equipment.
"In 2021, we recovered more than 21 million devices including mobile phones, internet gateways and television set top boxes."
