"BROADCOM 2022 ESG Report | Workforce32Compensation Broadcoms success depends on its continued ability to attract, motivate and retain our workforce."
"Competition for talented employees is significant in many locations where we operate, such as Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia."
"As a result, we provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to our employees, including performance-based compensation (such as our annual cash bonus program, sales incentive plans and spot bonuses) and equity awards."
Broadcom is different from its peer companies because a vast majority of our employees receive equity awards that vest over time.
We grant equity to our employees because we want our employees to share in Broadcoms success.

BROADCOM 2022 ESG Report | Workforce35Health and Safety During COVID-19 For most of 2022, we have been able to return to the office and maintain on-site operations because we have implemented and continue to implement numerous additional proactive measures to protect and invest in the health and well-being of our workforce."
"At the start of COVID-19, we proactively consulted with third-party certified industrial hygienists and epidemiologists in adopting additional protective measures on top of complying with government mandated safety protocols and industry standards, including: Provided masks, gloves, hand sanitizers and disinfecting cleaning supplies for all on-site personnel, and mandated that personnel wear masks Maintained thermal scanning cameras and infrared contactless thermometers at all locations Required regular COVID-19 rapid antigen testing for employees, sub-tenants and visitors at most sites Reconfigured work space arrangements to reduce employee density in our facilities and promote social distancing Significantly enhanced cleaning protocols, including frequent intraday sanitization of high contact common areas and surfaces and daily electrostatic disinfection of common areas and conference rooms in many of our locations Maintained HVAC systems to meet or exceed American Society of Heating and Air-Conditioning Engineers guidance, which optimizes outdoor air, increases ventilation, and uses MERV 13 or higher filters Deployed portable HEPA filtration units for conference rooms and limited the number of people permitted in a conference room at a time Provided mental health support to our employees through our EAP and various health insurance provider sponsored initiatives On-site Health Clinic Beginning in March 2018, our Fort Collins facility has partnered with UCHealth to provide our employees with access to medical care through an on-site health clinic."
"The clinic is open during hours that overlap all employee shifts and is staffed by a physician assistant and a medical assistant, who can provide both personal primary care and occupational surveillance and treatment."
"Since September 2020, the clinic has had over 5,500 employee visits covering a range of services such as workers' compensation injury/illness evaluation, treatment and medical surveillance, medical consultation and COVID-19 mitigation."
"The clinic also provides personal primary care such as immunizations, blood draws, rapid diagnostic testing and drop-in vital sign measurements."
"Beginning in June 2022, our onsite third party contractors could access the clinic in addition to Broadcom employees, resulting in almost 3,000 employee and contractor visits in 2022."
"Responsible Supply ChainBROADCOM 2022 ESG Report | Responsible Supply Chain37We are committed to supporting ethical business conduct, respecting human rights and responsibly sourcing materials throughout our global supply chain."
"Our Supplier Environmental and Social Responsibility Code of Conduct (Supplier Code), which reflects the Responsible Business Alliances Code of Conduct, is the foundation of our responsible sourcing practices."
"Our Supplier Code, along with our contract and purchase order terms, establish our expectations regarding workplace standards and business practices for our suppliersincluding with respect to labor and human rights, health and safety, the environment and anti-corruption."
We outsource most of our manufacturing and strive to work with responsible supply chain partners that are leaders in the industry.
Our integrated approach in managing human rights in our business and supply chain is set forth below.
"Supply Chain Management HUMAN RIGHTS POLICIES Our commitment to respecting human rights is in our Human Rights Principles, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Supplier Environmental and Social Responsibility Code of Conduct and Conflict Minerals PolicySALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT ASSESSMENT We conducted a Human Rights Impact Assessment in 2022 to ensure our human rights program efforts are focused on our most salient human rights impact areasSUPPLIER HUMAN RIGHTS ENGAGEMENT We conduct supplier human rights surveys and assessments on an annual basis and when onboarding suppliers."
"We use a third-party tool to monitor our suppliers for emerging human rights issuesSUPPLIER HUMAN RIGHTS AUDITS We regularly audit our suppliers on human rights issues, including interviews with workers."
We work with our suppliers in establishing remediation plansHUMAN RIGHTS TRAINING We offer human rights awareness and forced labor prevention trainings to our suppliers and our employees on an annual basisHUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS We communicate our human rights related activities in our ESG Report and in our Statement Against Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.
"We also communicate with our suppliers through annual letters, trainings and certifications In 2021, Broadcom became a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)."
"We are committed to upholding RBAs vision of a global electronics industry that creates sustainable value for workers, the environment and business."
"As a member of RBA, we have leveraged some of RBAs tools in our supplier assessment program, including their Self-Assessment Questionnaires and Validated Assessment Program."
"BROADCOM 2022 ESG Report | Responsible Supply Chain38Human Rights Policies In 2022, we published our Human Rights Principles, which reflects our commitment to respecting human rights and avoiding complicity in any human rights abuse throughout our company, operations, supply chain and communities."
"Our employment and supply chain practices and policies, including our Supplier Code, support the fundamental human rights principles of freely chosen employment, non-discrimination, the elimination of forced and underage labor, and the rights of workers to engage in peaceful assembly, organize, freely associate and bargain collectively, as articulated in the International Labour Organization Conventions."
"Respecting human rights, particularly the rights of people in vulnerable communities (women, children and migrant workers) is a shared responsibility, and we strive to align our approach and actions with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights."
Salient Human Rights Impact Assessment Our Human Rights/Supply Chain Working Group conducted a human rights impact assessment (HRIA) to identify our most salient human rights concerns that could impact our supply chain.
"The assessment included input from and collaboration with key stakeholders, risk assessments and results of our internal audit of our supply chain."
"Based on the HRIA, the following is a list of human rights concerns that we particularly focus on in our supply chain: Forced labor (including recruiting fees and retainingworker identification documents) Working hours and rest days Young workers Worker disciplinary practices (e.g., use of wage fines aspunishment) Accurate worker agreements Fair wages Safe and healthy working conditions Freedom of association and collective bargainingSupplier Human Rights Engagement On an annual basis, we identify and survey our significant suppliers globally (that were not part of our prior surveys) for human rights-related issues."
"The suppliers surveyed in 2020, 2021 and 2022 collectively represent over 99.9% of our supply chain (based on our 2021 supplier spend)."
All new suppliers are also screened for potential human rights issues as part of our onboarding process.
"We found no instances of forced labor, child labor, slavery or human trafficking among Broadcoms suppliers."
"However, through the 2022 screenings, we identified a supplier in Japan with a policy that allows its employees to be fined as permitted by local laws."
"While this practice is legal in Japan, we have engaged with this supplier and requested the discontinuance of this practice."
"Through this survey process, we have identified suppliers that we can support in developing more robust human rights programs, policies and/or training and have begun to engage with those suppliers."
"All surveyed suppliers, as well as certain categories of new suppliers, are placed in our third-party continuous monitoring program to alert us to emerging human rights issues that might arise with the suppliers."
"Human Rights in Supply Chain 99.9+% SUPPLY CHAIN SUPPLIERS SURVEYED FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES BROADCOM 2022 ESG Report | Responsible Supply Chain39Human Rights Communication In addition to publicly reporting on human rights annually in our ESG Reports, we publish an annual Statement Against Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking in compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the U."
K. Modern Slavery Act and the Australian Modern Slavery Act.
Anyone inside or outside of Broadcom can communicate with Broadcoms Compliance Officer and Compliance Team via our Ethics and Compliance Hotline (available in all relevant languages) to report any human rights-related issues.
"We take all reported issues seriously, and we promptly investigate and take disciplinary actions as appropriate (which may include senior management discussions, employee communications, trainings, process and controls improvements and corrective action measures)."
COMMUNICATION WITH OUR SUPPLIERS ANNUAL LETTER We send a letter that provides information on our supply chain human rights program and our Supplier CodeCERTIFICATIONS We require our larger manufacturing suppliers to certify adherence to our Supplier Code on an annual basisHUMAN RIGHTS TRAINING We oer human rights and forced labor prevention training to our suppliersONBOARDING We screen new suppliers for human rights concerns SURVEYS We identify and survey our signicant suppliers globallySupplier Human Rights Audits Our Global Operations and Internal Audit teams regularly audit our suppliers operations and compliance with various Broadcom and human rights-related requirements.
"In their audits, our teams review wage and hour labor laws, working conditions, employment agreements and recruitment fee payments."
"While these audits are typically on-site audits at the supplier location, many audits were still conducted remotely in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
The audits that were conducted on-site included worker interviews.
The human rights-related findings from these audits in 2022 identified three suppliers that required remediation.
Two suppliers needed to improve their worker hours tracking systems to ensure their workers did not work beyond permitted hour limits.
Another supplier needed to provide clearer communication with its workers on employment agreement terms.
We required action plans for these suppliers and the findings have been remediated.
"Human Rights Training As part of our ongoing efforts to educate and raise awareness of forced labor and human trafficking issues, we require annual human rights awareness and forced labor prevention training for relevant employees in our Global Operations, Human Resources, Legal, Procurement and supply chain functions who have a direct responsibility for supply chain management."
Our employees working with our U.
S. government customers complete combating trafficking in persons and prevention of forced labor training on an annual basis.
"In 2022, we achieved a 100% completion rate for both of these trainings."
"BROADCOM 2022 ESG Report | Responsible Supply Chain40We are committed to socially responsible sourcing of conflict minerals (cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, gold, wolframite, and/or their derivatives tin, tantalum and tungsten) that are included in our products."
"We also strongly support our industrys efforts to expand the smelter certification program and the audit process, including expanding these efforts to include cobalt."
"We are a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), and leverage RMIs resources to conduct our conflict minerals supply chain due diligence, including using RMIs database of suppliers that are listed on the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) Conformant Smelter List."
"Because we outsource most of our manufacturing, we do not typically have a direct relationship with the smelters and refiners (SORs)."
"In 2021, 93% (243 out of 260) of the active SORs potentially in our supply chain were certified conflict free under the RMAP audit process."
This high level of conformance is due to our on-going efforts to identify conflict minerals risks in our supply chain and encourage our suppliers to purchase materials only from SORs that are certified as conflict free in compliance with RMAP protocols.
"For more information, see our Conflict Minerals Policy and 2021 Conflict Minerals Report ."
We provide relevant employees with training on supplier diversity and integrate supplier diversity considerations into our supplier onboarding process.
"We seek to source goods and services from minority- owned, woman-owned, historically underutilized businesses, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran- owned, small and disadvantaged businesses that are able to provide quality goods and services in a timely and competitive manner."
"Responsible Minerals Sourcing Supplier Diversity COVID-19 and Business Continuity As the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2022, we worked closely with our supply chain to safeguard their workers health and ensure continued supply of products and services."

We use the methodology outlined in the World Resource Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Developments (WBCSD) GHG Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) and the WRI/WBSCDs GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance an amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to calculate Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions generated by our global facilities.
"We calculate the GHG emissions associated with the fossil fuels we utilize for heating our facilities and operating our backup emergency generators, as well as the refrigerant losses from HVAC operations and PFCs and other process gases used in our manufacturing processes (Scope 1 emissions)."
"The GHG Protocol defines PFCs as one of the seven gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol, which also includes carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, HFCs, sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride."
"To measure the other indirect emissions occurring in our value chain, we used the methodology outlined in the WRI/WBCSDs GHG Protocol: Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0)."
GHG emissions are reported in metric tonnes of COe (tCOe).
Fuel and Energy Consumption Table The 2021 historical data and associated Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have been restated due to improvements in data availability.
"Our energy consumption is limited to natural gas, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene and electricity use."
We calculate energy consumption and GHG emissions based on actual data when available.
"When actual consumption data is not available, we estimate utilizing square footage intensity factors by facility type."
"Other fuels include diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene."
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Table The 2021 historical data and associated Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have been restated due to improvements in data availability.
Emission factors used in Scope 1 emissions calculations include the U.
"S. EPAs Climate Leaders, Emissions Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (published April 2022)."
"Specific to PFC emissions, the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) guidance was used."
Emission factors used in Scope 2 GHG emissions calculations include the U.
"S. EPAs Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) 2020 (published February 2022), IEAs Statistics Data Service: Emission Factors (published September 2022) and the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB): European Residual Mixes 2021 (published June 2022) Residual Mix factors."
"In 2022, Scope 2 emissions take into account the procurement of Green-e certified RECs at the Fort Collins, Colorado facility."
We follow the hierarchy outlined in Table 6.3 of the WRI/WBSCD GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance for selecting appropriate emission factors for Scope 2 market-based method.
"Scope 2 emissions include colocation data center electricity consumption, estimated using a 8760 energy model."
"Emissions from Fuel-and-Energy-Related-Activities (Scope 3, Category 3) capture emissions from fuel and energy (market-based) consumption not already included in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions calculations."
Grid loss percentages and emission factors are from the U.
S. EPAs eGRID 2020 (published February 2022) for U.
S. locations and the IEA (published September 2022) for international locations.
International grid loss percentages are from the World Bank Electric Power Transmission and Distribution Losses.
Emissions factors used in the calculation of emissions from Scope 3 Categories 5-7 include the U.
"S. EPA's Climate Leaders, Emissions Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (published April 2022), and 2021 (published January 2022) Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)."
"The waste emissions boundary includes data outlined in the Waste Management section: non-hazardous waste from global owned facilities, e-scrap waste from global owned and leased facilities, and hazardous waste data from global manufacturing facilities."
We exclude activity data related to hotel nights incurred during business travel from Scope 3 Category 6.
Employee commuting emissions are calculated by multiplying average commute distances by emission factors from typical transportation modes.
We currently exclude emissions related to remote working (optional emissions) from Scope 3 Category 7.
Emissions factors used in the calculation of Scope 3 Category 7 include the U.
"S. EPAs eGRID 2020 (published February 2022), and the U."
"S. EPAs Climate Leaders, Emissions Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories (published April 2022)."
