"We have made significant progress by focusing on consumer needs, collaborating across our business and the health system, and using technology to make health care simpler and easier to navigate."
Home-based and virtual capabilities are helping more people access the care they need.
Value-based care models are improving patient outcomes and lowering the total cost of care.
A whole-person approach to behavioral and medical care is driving better health outcomes.
Our health system partnerships are creating greater efficiencies while helping providers focus on providing high-quality patient care.
But there is still work to do.
Our fragmented health care system is still difficult to navigate for many.
"Costs remain an impediment to accessing care, particularly for those in underserved communities."
Long-standing disparities in care have led to unequal outcomes for various populations.
"We have the opportunity to address todays challenges through the impact of our work across UnitedHealth Group and our mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone not just for the 147 million people our company serves, but for anyone who interacts with the health care system."

UnitedHealth Group is committed to enabling and delivering equitable care that addresses health disparities and improves health outcomes an enterprise priority reflected in our mission and supported by our five strategic growth areas.
"Ultimately, our company is successful when we are able to improve access to affordable, high-quality care for everyone."
"Today, however, there are still far too many barriers to good health disproportionately experienced by people of color, historically marginalized communities and people with fewer economic resources."
Health care inequities are rooted in long-standing disparities in health across a broad range of social and economic factors.
High health costs and inadequate access are key contributors.
Institutional bias in evidence-based care impacts the health status of different populations.
"Social determinants of health, such as food insecurity, education level and income, are among the many factors that contribute to widening gaps in health and well-being."
"Although the COVID-19 pandemic has brought more attention to health equity, we know disparities existed well before it occurred."

"Racial disparities in maternal health have widened since 2005, with Black mothers continuing to face a disproportionately higher rate of mortality over time."

"We are further advancing our emissions measurement and we are proud to release our first-ever comprehensive scope 1 and 2 inventory, located in the data tables of this report."
Our reported emissions have increased in 2021 due to the following drivers: Change in boundar y: We reported all our global businesses and fleet data within our operational control for the first time.
Change in methodology : Sites that were previously reported as scope 3 moved to scope 1 and 2.
P ortfolio growth: Through business combinations.
"We are currently assessing our scope 3 footprint, which we intend to complete in 2022."
We plan to share our most significant categories of scope 3 data in our 2022 Sustainability Report.
"In previous years, we disclosed scope 3 categories of waste generated in operations, business travel and employee commuting."
"Our deeper assessment in 2021 identified our most significant categories as: Pur chased goods and services C apital goods U pstream transportation and distribution W aste In vestments The calculation of our scope 3 footprint combined with the updated scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint will give us a comprehensive baseline, allowing us to commit to setting a net-zero science-based target and make meaningful GHG reductions in the years to come."
"Environmental Health 63 2021 Sustainability ReportA Modern, High-Performing Health System Introduction Our People and Culture Responsible Business Practices Performance Data Improving energy efficiency in our buildings Supporting the transition to renewable energy A significant part of our commitment to operational net-zero includes identifying and scaling our reliance on renewable energy sources, which will directly decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve the health of the communities where we operate."
"We are currently evaluating the sourcing of renewable energy across our operations, including on-site and off-site renewable energy production, virtual power purchase agreements and other renewable purchasing options."
"Examples of renewable energy sourcing could include deploying on-site solar systems on parking garages and rooftops at targeted core facilities, investing in off-site renewable solar and wind development, and other renewable purchasing options available through our utility partners."
Our approach provides an opportunity to shift the broader demand for renewable energy in the communities where we operate.
"To meet our operational net-zero commitment, we are scaling solutions that reduce energy consumption in our entire real estate footprint ranging from data centers and pharmaceutical distribution centers, to clinical care facilities."
"This approach includes new construction projects, renovations, collaboration with landlords and simple employee behavior programs."
"For example, we are finalizing the construction of phase 1 of a two-building, 352,000-square-foot administrative campus in San Antonio, Texas."
Phase 1 is scheduled to open in 2022.
"It represents what will be the first WELL-certified campus in our portfolio, an industry-recognized attestation measuring a facilitys health and human experience attributes through building design and operations."

"P olicy, financing and metrics Environmental Health 65 2021 Sustainability ReportA Modern, High-Performing Health System Introduction Our People and Culture Responsible Business Practices Performance Data In an increasingly digital world, the average consumers health care experience too often involves paper."
UnitedHealth Group uses 2.8 billion sheets of paper annually to communicate with members.
"Beyond the environmental impact, the paper-based experience is often more time-consuming and cumbersome for members."
"Members are asked to review and return documents by mail or fax, or by scanning and emailing."
Paper creates inefficiencies that slow down decision-making for members who expect timely answers about their health.
"We are working with a diverse set of stakeholders, including employers, consumers, providers, health equity advocates and the health care industry, as well as regulators and government partners."
"Of all the paper we generate, we estimate roughly 40% is related in some way to regulatory direction and requirement."
"Collaboration with government, regulators and others will be critical to reduce or eliminate as much of this usage as possible and create digital solutions and alternatives for paper-based processes."
We are committed to reducing our paper usage and advocating for the reduction of paper across the health system to the greatest extent possible over the coming years.
"We are working toward providing paperless experiences for consumers and providers a dual-purpose goal designed to minimize use of energy, water and raw materials while creating a better consumer experience."
Reducing paper usage would also improve the speed and simplicity of our member communications by replacing paper-based communications with digital tools.

We will develop a technology framework that standardizes and automates AI/ML quality checks for use across our enterprise.
"Finally, we are engaging with industry and academic partners to review our best practices and to co-research and publish leadership for the benefit of the health industry."
"We recognize that the use of AI/ML can have unintended consequences, including consequences that can arise from bias in the health care system, data or algorithms."
"We take steps throughout the design, development, deployment and monitoring of AI/ML to help mitigate bias."
"These steps include forming a team with a range of expertise to help identify potential issues, assessing the data and model for potential sources of bias and developing cross-discipline mitigation approaches to mitigate bias."
We are developing processes for situations where bias or risks to health equity are found that may include suspending or delaying release of AI/ML until the risks are addressed through a mitigation plan.
