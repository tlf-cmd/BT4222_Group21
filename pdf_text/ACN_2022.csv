How we have zero tolerance for any form of retaliation against anyone who raises a concern.
This site also reports aggregated internal data on a global percentage basis about the types of conduct-based matters that were investigated in the previous fiscal year and their outcomes.
"Further increasing transparency, we make public our policy on Speaking Up and Zero Tolerance for Retaliation , which outlines how employees can raise a concern (including formal grievances if required) and reporting and escalation procedures."
Guiding our peoples behaviors The first fundamental behavior in our COBE is Make Your Conduct Count.
"It articulates five locally relevant yet globally applicable standards to guide how our people think and act across our unique and diverse culture: We speak up about concerns, knowing Accenture never tolerates retaliation."
We treat each other with respect.
"We are proud to be ambassadors of Accenture, and we act accordingly."
We apply our principle of meritocracy when we make decisions about our people.
We ensure our personal interests and relationships do not create conflicts for Accenture.
"This framework creates a foundation for a positive, respectful and inclusive work environment that can inspire our people; reflects who we are and who we want to be as a company; and guides how we work with clients, our partners and each other."
We believe these ethical behaviors are critical to the success of our business and continue to include them in our required Ethics & Compliance training.
We monitor our ethical environment through anonymous surveys of our people at regular intervals.
"Overview Sustainability Talent Inclusion & Diversity Client Experience Financial Reporting & Data360 Value Report 2022 19 Data privacy and information security Safeguarding data is one of our most important responsibilities in building and maintaining trust, not only with our people, but also with our clients and others."
"Beyond specific regional legal requirements, we apply strict data privacy and security standards to all information, everywhere."
"All our people have a personal responsibility to practice effective and responsible data management in accordance with our policies, including our Data Privacy Policy and procedures, our Binding Corporate Rules, as well as new and changing global regulations and jurisprudence."
This responsibility serves as a cornerstone of all we do.
"The Audit Committee of our Board continues to have oversight of our information technology risk exposures, including cybersecurity, data privacy and data security."
"While many of our people have returned to office spaces, others continue to work in remote and hybrid work environments."
"This complex work model, partnered with potential business risks associated with ongoing geopolitical tensions, reinforces the need for a proactive, cyber-resilient approach to keep data safe across our business, our people and our clients."
"For example: We adhere to the highest and strictest information protection and privacy standards for handling and protecting personal data, as evidenced by our global certifications for Information Security (ISO 27001:2013) and Data Privacy (ISO 27701:2019)."
"These certifications acknowledge that Accenture complies with the highest, strictest standards for handling and protecting personal data everywhere, and demonstrates accountability."
"We were the first global organization to be ISO 27701-certified by the British Standards Institution (BSI) globally, across both our Enterprise and Client Service Business."
"We work hard to uphold global data protection and privacy requirements, including the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and other data privacy laws in countries where we do business."
Our Enterprise and Client Data Protection programs define the stewardship of Accenture and client information.
"They define our management processes and controls, in accordance with relevant information protection and privacy laws."
BSI has rated Accenture as highest for all U.

"Overview Sustainability Talent Inclusion & Diversity Client Experience Financial Reporting & Data360 Value Report 2022 20 Responsible AI Responsible artificial intelligence (AI) is the practice of designing, developing and deploying AI with good intention to empower employees and businesses, and fairly impact customers and society."
"At Accenture, we are acutely sensitive to our role in innovating responsibly and consider AI and related technologies one of our highest ESG priorities."
"As AI decisions increasingly influence and impact people's lives, the responsibility of enterprises to manage the potential ethical and sociotechnical implications of AI adoption also grows."
"When we think about these implications, issues such as bias/ fairness and transparency/explainability become paramount."
Businesses cannot expect to scale data and AI effectively within their organizationsand thus ultimately realize the business value of the technologywithout embedding Responsible AI into their approach from the beginning.
"To create trust and build confidence in AI, we work with our clients to translate ethical principles and academic research into practical, measurable metrics and methodologies that can be embedded into everyday processes."
"We take a cross- functional, multidisciplinary approach and provide our clients with strategic leadership and technical tools across the spectrum of AI governance, risk management, accountability, explainability and cultural adoption."
We have defined four pillars of Responsible AI based on what weve learned from implementing our solutions with clients: Principles and governance : Define and articulate a Responsible AI mission and principles while establishing a transparent governance structure across the organization that builds confidence and trust in AI technologies.
"Risk, policy and control : Strengthen compliance with current laws and regulations while monitoring future ones, develop policies to mitigate risk, and operationalize those policies through a risk management framework with regular reporting and monitoring."
"Technology and enablers : Develop tools and techniques to support principles such as fairness, explainability, robustness, traceability and privacy, and build them into AI systems and platforms."
Culture and training : Empower leadership to elevate Responsible AI as a critical business imperative and provide training to enable all employees to have a clear understanding of Responsible AI principles and criteria for success.
"Business continuity Our approach to managing disruptions is based on years of experience, preparation and adapting the way we manage and deliver services."
"Our business resilience strategy supports how we operate as a company, starting with our global client base, underpinned by internal functions and technology, and supported by the collaborations of our third-party ecosystem."
"Accentures business resilience program is aligned to industry standards (ISO 22301, ISO 20000, ISO 27001 and ISO 27701)."
"For more information, see our business continuity case study ."

"As stated in our Code of Business Ethics (COBE), we seek to align to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ."
We therefore focus our human rights efforts on those areas that are most relevant to our business and operations in terms of potential human rights impacts.
We also recognize that our clients and other stakeholders increasingly seek visibility into our human rights practices and policies.
"We continue to review our human rights efforts, as well as best practices in the marketplace, to assess how we can further strengthen our commitments."
"In cases where it is unclear how to apply the law in a way that is consistent with our human rights principles, we are guided by our core values and COBE to support and respect the principles of internationally recognized human rights."
"We also adhere to relevant international instruments and documents, including the International Labour Organizations Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work , in addition to the UN Guiding Principles."
Our human rights governance We recognize that support and respect for human rights is an integral part of our sustainability commitments.
"The ESG steering committee has responsibility across all operational sustainability topics, including human rights governance and strategic decision making."
This committee is chaired by our Senior Managing Director and Executive Director Corporate Services & Sustainability and Business Operations.
"Our human rights priorities We focus our human rights efforts on areas most relevant to our business and operations in terms of potential human rights impacts: Diversity and equal opportunity Health, safety and security Employment conditions and working practices Supply chain Data privacy Anticorruption Human rights and our supply chain Because of the global scale and diversity of our business, we prioritize our supply chain due diligence efforts by focusing on areas that align with our priorities; areas where we can appropriately make the most impact; and areas of heightened concern or in higher-risk geographies."
We recognize the importance of assessing potential risks to rightsholders.
"We continually review, adapt and incorporate human rights due diligence across our enterprise risk management systems and legal compliance processes, in addition to across our supply chain."
Our relationships with our suppliers help us amplify our human rights commitment.
"Our Supplier Standards of Conduct (SSoC), which supplements our COBE, sets out the standards and practices that Accenture suppliers are required to uphold or make an equivalent commitment."
"In turn, Accenture expects our suppliers to apply our SSoC to their own suppliers."
"Overview Sustainability Talent Inclusion & Diversity Client Experience Financial Reporting & Data360 Value Report 2022 We work to be thoughtful and targeted in how we select and engage our suppliers, particularly in relation to higher- risk sectors and countries, and as our business evolves."
"For example, we worked with a third-party specialist to help prepare our first Conflict Minerals Report by reviewing our supply chain for products that contain 3TG minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold)."
"We are committed to doing business ethically and legally, and we seek to leverage our global buying power to advance human rights."
We continue to invest in new technology and processes to help us have greater visibility into the ESG performance of our suppliers.
"We are proud of the launch of our Sustainable Procurement Hub (The Hub), which we are rolling out globally."
"This new technology platform will enhance and provide greater transparency from our direct suppliers about their own human rights policies, due diligence and inclusive practices."
"The Hub supports how we make ethical purchasing decisions, onboard our suppliers and assess their ESG progress."
"It is also a vital part of our compliance with supply chain due diligence requirements, including Germanys Supply Chain Act and Norways Transparency Act."
"24Overview Sustainability Talent Inclusion & Diversity Client Experience Financial Reporting & DataMalica, Manager Accenture Song, Design Atlanta, United States 360 Value Report 2022 25 Conflict minerals Accentures Supplier Inclusion & Sustainability team has a dedicated focus on conflict minerals in our supply chain."
"Given the recent evolution of our Industry X business into hardware manufacturing, this work is a vital part of how we address modern slavery across our global supply chain."
"For more information, see our Conflict Minerals Report ."
"Raising concerns We encourage our people, suppliers and subcontractors to raise ethical and legal concerns, including potential human rights issues, and we provide a range of secure channels for them to do so confidentially, and anonymously where allowed by law."
"We provide a mechanism to enable our suppliers employees to speak up about legal or ethical concerns, including slavery and human trafficking."
"Employees of Accenture suppliers may report concerns or violations (anonymously, where permitted by local law) through the Accenture Business Ethics Helpline ."
"Anyone with an ethical or human rights concern about Accentures supply chains or organization can contact the helpline by phone or online: A free phone number+1 312 737 8262 (or in India, +1 888 276 6226; access code 000-117)is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
Online inquiries can be submitted to our Business Ethics Helpline website.
"All queries are handled by an independent team confidentiallyand, where allowed by law, anonymously."
"Whether internal or external, we treat all concerns seriously and in strict confidence."
"We protect anyone who raises, in good faith, a concern about a human rights issue or who assists us, or a law enforcement authority, by providing information to address such a concern."
Living wage Accenture continues to drive the adoption of a living wage with our suppliers around the world.
Our Supplier Standards of Conduct strongly encourages our suppliers to pay a living wage (or higher) to people who provide services directly to our company and/or our clients.
"Modern slavery, child labor and human trafficking Our long-standing commitment to human rights includes eliminating modern slavery, child labor and human trafficking in our supply chains."
"Given the nature of our business and supply chains, and the risk assessments we have undertaken to date, we believe the risk of modern slavery, child labor and human trafficking in our supply chains is low."
"However, we are not complacent and frequently review how we can improve and evolve in response to changing circumstances and our evolving business."
Our Modern Slavery Transparency Statement provides more information about our efforts.
"While this statement is required by law in the United Kingdom and Australia, it also covers our commitment beyond these jurisdictions."
Overview Sustainability Talent Inclusion & Diversity Client Experience Financial Reporting & Data360 Value Report 2022 26 Supply chain The size and scale of our supply chain affords us the opportunity to drive a culture of responsible buying.
"As we continue to grow as a company, we recognize our responsibility to deliver long-term value to society through our clients, suppliers and communities."
Procurement Plus Our overarching approach shapes how we work with suppliers to promote sustainability.
"Beyond transactional procurement, Procurement Plus addresses four thematic pillars to advance responsible buying: the environment, human rights, supplier inclusion and diversity, and the future of work."
"This approach informs every aspect of our supply chain, building stronger partnerships based on ethical behaviors, transparency, agility and inclusivity."
Responsible procurement Our Procurement Plus buying program influences key initiatives such as our award-winning Supplier Inclusion & Sustainability Program.
We are committed to driving responsible buying practices for ourselves and for the wider marketplace.
We have shared insights into our approach on sustainability during business reviews with select suppliers.
"We continue to focus on priority areas such as environment, human rights, supplier inclusion and diversity, and our Supplier Standards of Conduct (SSoC)."
"Our ethical procurement strategy As we continue to build supply chains that are more sustainable and inclusive, we recognize the need for an ethical procurement strategy that is reflective of our core values and our Code of Business Ethics (COBE)."
"Our ethical procurement strategy is an underlying component of our business practice and influences applicable training for Accenture people, selection criteria for suppliers and the development of our standards for conducting business with our suppliers."
"To encourage broader transparency within our supply chains, we require our suppliers to adhere to our SSoC, which supplement our COBE, or to make an equivalent commitment."
"We communicate the standards through a range of mechanisms, including contractual terms and conditions, the Suppliers Guide to Doing Business with Accenture , as well as our purchase order process."
We continue to reiterate our commitment to our standards through communication to 100% of suppliers that are included in our supplier management program.
* We have invested in further developing and strengthening our governance framework (for suppliers who agree to an equivalent) in line with our new Sustainable Procurement Hub operating model.
Our SSoC reflects our support of the Ten Principles of the UNGCand we have continued to lead by example in upholding these principles since we signed the UNGC in 2008.
"These standards are published in 20 languages and set out the labor standards, human rights principles, and other legal and ethical standards we require our SSoC to uphold when conducting business."
* Our supplier management program includes third-party suppliers with whom Accenture has a direct and enduring contractual relationship.
"We also expect our suppliers to apply these standards to their own suppliers, thereby continuing the impact of our ethical procurement strategy."
We continue to evolve our global SSoC in line with our commitment to responsible business.
"For example, in fiscal 2022, we updated our trade control requirements."
"Additionally, we review our supply chain strategy annually through the lens of our COBE and the UNGC Ten Principles as part of our efforts to set industry standards for maintaining an ethical supply chain."
This is particularly important as part of our continuing efforts to encourage our suppliers to pay a living wage.
"Payment certainty We realize the economic certainty that prompt payments can provide a supplier, whether a FORTUNE 500 company or a SME."
"In the United Kingdom, we are a signatory to the voluntary Prompt Payment Code, which requires a continual focus on ensuring that we pay our suppliers on time, within the payment terms agreed."
We consistently make more than 95% of our U.
"K. payments within 60 days, as required by the code."
Our Payment on Time Centre of Excellence and technology investment drives continuous improvements in this area.
We are proud to be leaders in shifting the payment culture to be more efficient and fairer.
"Overview Sustainability Talent Inclusion & Diversity Client Experience Financial Reporting & Data360 Value Report 2022 27 Driving supplier sustainability In our drive for responsible buying excellence, we work continuously through relevant networks with our industry peers and clients to adopt sustainable practices and are continually improving our supplier and contractor management processes."
"We encourage a responsible buying culture by advocating for supply chains that are more sustainable and inclusive, both inside and outside our company."
"Promoting supplier engagement We actively work toward increasing the number of suppliers reporting their sustainability performancefor example, the percentage of suppliers that report emissions reduction targets and actions or regularly assess their own supply chains."
"Sustainable Procurement Hub We continue to invest in new technology and processes to help us have greater visibility into environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of our suppliers."
"The Hub (introduced on p. 24,) which launched in fiscal 2021 and continues to roll out globally, is providing greater transparency from our suppliers about their own human rights policies and sustainability practices."
"The tool also allows us to perform due diligence processes to inform our buyer selection decisions, onboarding and ad hoc ESG assessments."
The Hub is currently operational in over 30 countries with further deployments and program enhancements planned in fiscal 2023.
"We have utilized The Hub to conduct more than 3,000 sustainability assessments to better understand our suppliers ESG performance."
"Carbon disclosure We expect our suppliers to prioritize sustainability and provide updates on their environmental initiatives, goals and impact."
"As a corporate member of CDPs Supply Chain Program, we use CDP tools as well as The Hub to promote engagement, transparency and sustainable practices with our suppliers."
"For example, since 2010 we have invited select suppliers to respond to CDPs supply chain self-assessment questionnaire."
"As of December 1, 2022, 68% of key suppliers disclosed their targets and 75% disclosed the actions they are taking, up from 58% and 60% as of December 1, 2021, respectively."
We know that addressing this area of emissions is a priority to drive action toward responsible business decisions.
"Increasingly, our suppliers are collectively using more emission-reducing energy sources, minimizing the footprint of their goods and services, and adapting to customer preferences in their reporting."
"As part of our goal to reach net-zero by the end of 2025, we set an ambitious target requiring 90% of our key suppliers* to disclose their environmental targets and actions being taken to reduce emissions."
Working with our clients We continue to support our clients who seek value delivered by including supplier inclusion and diversity in sourcing.
"For example, leveraging our global Supplier Inclusion & Sustainability model and experience, we helped develop a responsible sourcing strategy and operating model for a global bank."
"The strategy leveraged ESG Book analytics, set a comprehensive direction for the banks procurement function to deliver on its net-zero and diversity and inclusion priorities, and provided a suite of toolkits and training for procurement, business and supplier engagement."
"To further advance awareness of the positive impact procurement has on sustainability, Accenture has joined forces with The Sustainable Procurement Pledge (SPP)."
"The SPP is a global, nonprofit community of procurement professionals that aims to embed sustainability in their daily activities."
"SPP empowers and equips procurement professionals with access to the right knowledge, tools and behavior."
Accenture is supporting these efforts and participating in the leadership and advisory panels.
* Key suppliers are defined as vendors that represent a significant portion of our 2019 Scope 3 emissions.
