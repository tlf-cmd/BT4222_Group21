"We are focused on putting possibility into practice and inspiring optimism for a brighter, cleaner, and healthier futurea unified commitment we call Disney Planet Possible ."
Our commitment to environmental sustainability goes back to our founding nearly 100 years ago.
"As Walt Disney himself said, Conservation isnt just the business of a few people, its a matter that concerns all of us."
"Our environmental commitments, summarized in this report and detailed in our 2030 Env ironmental Goals White Paper , represent some of the ways we are focused on helping to build on that legacy for communities around the globe, generation after generation."
"2030 ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS In December 2020 and December 2022, we established a set of environmental goals that aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; help protect local watersheds; minimize waste; create products and packaging with environmentally preferable materials; and design and construct our buildings and attractions sustainably."
"See more information about our environmental goals and how we plan to achieve them:Environmental Action Through Collaboration Learn more in our Data & Reporting Frameworks We are a member of several initiatives and organizations, which we engage with regularly to support actions consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement and other environmental, climate, and conservation ambitions."

We plan to submit this target to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for assessment.
Our strategy for achieving net zero for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 is based on the following fact- based reduction hierarchy: 1.
Designing our built environment to reduce or avoid emissions 2.
Reducing emissions through fuel and energy efficiency 3.
Replacing high-carbon energy sources with lower-carbon alternatives 4.
"Investing in certified natural climate solutionsLike most companies setting aspirational Scope 3 targets, these are challenging goals, and success depends on several external factors, including actions by our suppliers to reduce their emissions, global economy-wide transitions to cleaner fuels, availability of economically feasible solutions at scale, and consumer behavioral changes."
Industry collaboration is key to addressing some of these challenges.
See previous page for some of the organizations we engage with regularly.
"We follow the global frameworks established by the GHG Protocol to measure Scope 1, 2 & 3 GHGs: See more information about our environmental efforts: Access emissions data: 8 We define net emissions and net zero emissions for our 2030 goals as follows: Net emissions = Scope 1 emissions + Scope 2 emissions (market-based) carbon credits."
"Scope 2 emissions (market-based) include emission reductions attributed to utility green power purchases, power purchase agreements, and unbundled energy attribute certificates (EACs)."
Our approach to carbon credits can be found in our Natural Climate Solutions White Paper .
We will have achieved our 2030 net zero emissions goal when net emissions as defined above equals 0.
"31 World in Balance Our Approach Introduction World of Hope Investing in Our People Operating Responsibly Data & Reporting Frameworks Table of Contents World of Belonging Progressing Toward Net Zero GHG Emissions for Direct Operations9 We are working to reduce our emissions by identifying ways to improve efficiency, reduce energy use, and use alternative low-carbon fuels."
"REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM PRODUCTIONS Our film and television productions are working to reduce emissions by replacing the diesel generators traditionally used to power sets and instead tying into the grid while on location or using battery electric, hybrid (diesel plus battery), and green hydrogen fuel cell generators."
"For example, in 2022, battery electric generators, which were recharged by solar panels, provided power for several weeks while filming on a beach, and grid ties replaced diesel generators on backlots in London, Vancouver, and Los Angeles."
ENERGY-EFFICIENT UPGRADES AT THEME PARKS We continue to make energy-efficient upgrades at our theme parks and resorts.
"For example, Shanghai Disney Resort installed a new water pump in the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction and added timing controls to outdoor fountains."
"Together, we expect to see approximately 830,000 kilowatt-hours in electricity savings annually."
And Hong Kong Disneyland completed the installation of smart air conditioner occupancy sensors in guest rooms.
This energy-saving feature is now in use in all three hotels.
USING LOWER-CARBON FUELS The Disney Wish set sail in fiscal 2022 and was designed to be among the most energy-efficient cruise ships on the water.
"The Disney Wish was primarily powered by liquified natural gas in fiscal 2022, which, when compared to traditional diesel or marine fuel, significantly reduces several emissions and pollutants."
"NATURAL CLIMATE SOLUTIONS We also invest in high-quality, verified, and rigorously vetted natural climate solutions that generate meaningful carbon reductions as well as positive social and economic impacts."
These projects help us address emissions from our direct operations that we cannot avoid.
"For example, our investment with Proyecto Mirador provides fuel-efficient, wood- burning cookstoves to families in rural Honduras and Guatemala."

32 World in Balance Our Approach Introduction World of Hope Investing in Our People Operating Responsibly Data & Reporting Frameworks Table of Contents World of Belonging Accelerating Disneys Renewable Energy Portfolio Disney is committed to purchasing or producing 100% zero carbon electricity for all direct operations globally by 2030.
"We continue to research, invest in, and develop renewable electricity projects across our global portfolio."
"As of fiscal 2022, we have commissioned or announced more than 200 megawatts of solar capacity."
"Examples include: In collaboration with the utility serving Walt Disney World Resort, two 75-megawatt solar facilities are expected to come online and are projected to bring the Resorts renewable energy consumption up to nearly 40% of its annual total power use."
"Disneyland Paris is continuing the construction of approximately 50 acres of solar canopies, which will provide shade and shelter to more than 11,000 parking spaces and are estimated to generate approximately 36 gigawatt hours of electricity once fully operational."
"Hong Kong Disneyland has embarked on the next phase of one of the largest solar panel sites in Hong Kong, installed at 21 different attractions and buildings."
Select operations subscribe to high-credibility green power programs that advance the decarbonization of Disney and our local communities.
"For example, Pixar is subscribed to 100% renewable electricity through East Bay Community Energy."
"Mickey-shaped solar facility (located near EPCOT), which provides power to Walt Disney World Resort, was built in collaboration with Reedy Creek Improvement District and Duke Energy."

"Water is a shared resource, and we know that the Companys operations have an impact on local watershed conditions as well as on the health of our oceans."
"In keeping with the latest data and standards, our strategy reflects that water is a highly local issue, with individualized considerations in each geography."
"See more information about our water conservation efforts: Access water data: Water Conservation In 2022, we continued to implement site-specific water conservation strategies at our theme parks and resorts."
"For example, we are using artificial turf and are implementing a sophisticated irrigation control system at Disneyland Resort as part of drought-fighting efforts."
And Disneyland Paris is in the process of retrofitting the showerheads in two hotels with new LED-lit technology heads that allow guests to adjust their use to help conserve water.
"The turbine- powered LED lights change color based on the amount of water used, moving from blue to green, yellow, and eventually red when water use exceeds a certain volume."
"In a pilot, the new showerheads reduced water use by an average of 22% per room."
"Watershed Investments We are identifying critical regional water issues and are continuing to collaborate with local stakeholders, such as industry and nonprofit organizations, to safeguard the overall health of watersheds as a multi- use sustainable resource."
"For example, we support WWF-Hong Kongs project to foster innovative approaches, such as the use of water buffalo, to conserve wetlands in the Shui Hau watershed and increase water security for local people and wildlife."
"We also support The Nature Conservancys work in central Florida, including efforts to address growing freshwater demands, enhance water quality, improve water supply, and reduce flood risks through green stormwater infrastructure."
"Sustainable Seafood Responsible selection and sourcing of seafood is important to our business, to the livelihoods of the fishing industry worldwide, and to the health of the planet for future generations."
"In fiscal 2022, our U."
"S. parks, resorts, and cruise line sourced nearly 100% sustainable seafood.10 Fisheries are periodically evaluated for sustainability, and ratings for specific species do sometimes fluctuate."
This affects our ability to source consistently to our ambitious 100% target.
"Nonetheless, our commitment to our 100% sustainably sourced seafood goal remains, and we continue to collaborate with the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership in their work across the supply chain to improve fishing and aquaculture and advance sustainable seafood production."

"When there is unused food, we donate it to support local communities whenever feasible."
"We also utilize composting and biodigestion, and convert food waste into animal feed where possible."
"For instance, we have composting pilots at several restaurants, and Vero Beach Resort and Castaway Cay have installed biodigesters to manage inedible food waste."
"Reducing Single-Use Plastics We are committed to reducing single-use plastics in our parks and resorts, and eliminating single-use plastics on our cruise ships."
"For example, in fiscal 2022, Hong Kong Disneyland replaced plastic, disposable food service ware items, including to-go containers and cutlery, with wood alternatives and reusable melamine."
Disney Cruise Line has been working to eliminate single-use plastic categories and intends to be free of single-use plastics by 2025.
"Examples include introducing alternatives to plastic merchandise bags and guest laundry bags, disposable cutlery, cold beverage lids, and even plastic drink garnish sticks."
"In addition, to encourage the use of reusable water bottles, refill stations have been installed on all ships and Castaway Cay."
"From Glass to Groundcover As we explore options for the responsible disposal of glass from Walt Disney World Resort, we are piloting the use of a machine that pulverizes glass into gravel and sand-like pieces."

"Environmental Sustainability 20 Some previously published environmental data have been restated to reflect corrections, updates to methodology, and/or changes in emission factors."
Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 data have been revised to include Twenty-First Century Fox operations.
"21 The boundary for Disneys greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reporting includes owned and operated assets (such as Theme Parks & Resorts, Disney Cruise Line, and commercial spaces), leased assets (such as office locations), as well as Productions (including feature films, television, theatricals, and sporting events)."
Direct CO 2 emissions from biogenic fuels are not included in the Scope 1 totals.
"They are as follows: FY19: 29,146 MT CO 2e; FY20: 16,799 MT CO2e; FY21: 22,662 MT CO 2e; FY22: 4,890 MT CO 2e."
"22 GHG emissions are measured and calculated according to the principles in the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocols A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, 2004 Revised Edition (GHG Protocol)."
"23 Market-based emissions are used where available in calculating carbon credit retirements, total emissions, and net emissions."
We define net emissions as follows: Scope 1 emissions + Scope 2 emissions (market-based) carbon credits.
"Scope 2 emissions (market-based) include emission reductions attributed to utility green power purchases, power purchase agreements, and unbundled energy attribute certificates (EACs)."
Our approach to carbon credits can be found in our Natural Climate Solutions White Paper .
"We will have achieved our 2030 net zero emissions goal when net emissions, as defined above, equals 0."
"24 Carbon credits are from projects developed according to recognized standards (e.g., Climate Action Reserve, Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard)."
All credits are verified by accredited third-party reviewers.
25 Scope 3 emissions calculations follow guidance provided by the GHG Protocol.
"In many instances, these emissions calculations are based on estimated and extrapolated data and rely on third-party emission factor databases and industry averages."
"We expect to make continuous improvements to Scope 3 estimates over time, including updates to assessments of business activities and activity boundaries, and improvements in input data and emission factors."
"At the time of publishing this report, fiscal 2019 is our most recent Scope 3 inventory, with fiscal 2022 Scope 3 footprint calculation in progress (to be reported out at a later date)."
"26 Spend-based methodology estimates emissions for goods and services by collecting data on the economic value of goods and services purchased and multiplying that by relevant secondary (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g., average emissions per monetary value of goods)."
27 Hybrid methodology uses a combination of supplier-specific activity data (where available) and secondary data to fill the gaps.
"This method involves: collecting allocated Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data directly from suppliers; calculating upstream emissions of goods and services from suppliers activity data on the amount of materials, fuel, and electricity used, as well as distance transported and waste generated from the production of goods and services, and applying appropriate emission factors; and using secondary data to calculate upstream emissions wherever supplier-specific data are not available."
"28 Average data methodology estimates emissions for goods and services by collecting data on the mass (e.g., kilograms or pounds) or other relevant units of goods or services purchased, and multiplying by the relevant secondary (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g., average emissions per unit of good or service)."
"29 Fuel-based methodology involves determining the amount of fuel consumed (i.e., Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of transport providers) and applying the appropriate emission factor for that fuel."
"30 Average product methodology involves estimating emissions for goods by collecting data on the mass or other relevant units of goods purchased and multiplying by relevant secondary (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g., average emissions per unit of good)."
"31 Distance-based methodology involves determining the mass, distance, and mode of each shipment, then applying the appropriate mass-distance emission factor for the vehicle used."
32 Waste-type specific methodology involves using emission factors for specific waste types and waste treatment methods.
"33 Site-specific methodology involves site-specific fuel, electricity, and fugitive emissions data, and applying the appropriate emission factors.34 Franchise-specific methodology involves collecting site-specific activity data or Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data from franchisees."
"35 Asset-specific methodology involves collecting asset-specific (e.g., site-specific) fuel and energy use data and process and fugitive emissions data, or Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data from individual leased assets."
36 Emissions within this category were evaluated and determined not to be relevant.
Activities identified as downstream transportation and distribution do not result in significant Scope 3 emissions for the Company.
37 Emissions within this category were evaluated and determined not to be relevant.
The Company does not have any activities that it characterizes as intermediate goods.
"38 Total energy includes electricity, natural gas, chilled water, hot water, steam, compressed air, renewable energy, and fuels."
FY19FY21 data excludes energy from Productions.
39 Percentage grid electricity is purchased electricity consumption divided by total energy consumption.
40 Percentage renewables is renewable energy consumption divided by total energy consumption.
Renewable energy consumed includes renewable fuels and renewable electricity that we produce or purchase and match with Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GOs).
The renewable portion of the electricity grid mix for which we do not possess RECs or GOs is not included in this calculation.

"We define zero carbon electricity as any type of electricity generation that does not generate GHGs such as solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and large-scale hydropower."
"42 Waste diverted includes waste prevention, donations, recycling, compost, anaerobic digestion, and thermal waste-to-energy."
"Total waste generated includes diverted waste, waste sent to landfill, and incineration without energy recovery."
Incineration without energy recovery is not counted in total waste sent to landfill nor total waste divertedthus the two do not sum to total waste generated.
"43 For total Company data, facilities include Theme Parks & Resorts, Disney Cruise Line, ESPN, enterprise-owned commercial and office spaces, and Pixar."
"Excluded are all leased properties, Disney Stores and Distribution Centers, TV stations, and all construction materials."
"44 Diversion rate includes data from annual facility asset planning construction projects and construction for new assets that became operational in the reporting year, in the U."

"45 The boundary for Disneys water volume reporting includes owned and operated assets (Theme Parks & Resorts, Disney Cruise Line, owned commercial and office spaces, Studios, and ESPN)."
Water consumption from Disney Stores and leased assets are excluded.
Water data for Shanghai Disney Resort were not included in data prior to fiscal 2021.
"46 A third-party validator provided limited assurance of our fiscal 2019, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2021 GHG emissions."
Limited assurance of fiscal 2022 emissions will be reported out upon completion.
"Social Impact 47 Charitable cash contributions include Company-directed charitable cash donations, including contributions made by the Disney Conservation Fund, as well as employee-directed Matching Gifts grants and Disney VoluntEARS Grants."
48 In-kind support refers to noncash contributions comprising tangible items or non-tangible support.
"Donations may include, but are not limited to, estimated values for merchandise, theme park tickets, food, public service announcements (PSAs), character/talent appearances, and other noncash charitable support."
"Due to differences in distribution, viewership, programming, availability, pricing, marketplace demand, and other variables, PSAs are valued differently across our media platforms."
"For example, in some cases, PSAs are valued based on an average sales price for the time period."
"In other cases, the value is based on an average sponsor value across a daypart rotation."
"Therefore, we do not use a single method to value PSAs."
"49 Includes grants directed toward historically underrepresented and protected communities, including Asian American & Pacific Islander, Black & African American, Hispanic & Latino, Native American & Indigenous, and LGBTQIA+ communities, as well as People with Disabilities, veterans, and women."
We also include grants to organizations where a percentage of their services reaches underrepresented and protected communities.
"If the organization spends a majority of its efforts on these communities, we count the entire grant, and if the organization does not spend a majority, we count a proration of the grant."
We rely on each organizations self-reported percentages regarding communities served.
"On a sample basis, we validate the percentages that we report."
50 Disney VoluntEARS data includes hours logged by employees of The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries and is rounded.
