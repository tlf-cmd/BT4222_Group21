"Cloud Computing AMD server processors are also helping to advance the adoption of cloud computing, which is forecast to prevent emissions of more than 1 billion metric tons of CO 2 from 2021 -2024.35 AMD EPYC processors are used to power clo ud instances ranging from big data analytics to virtual desktops."
"As more enterprises move their computing applications from on-premises data centers to cloud -based data centers, server utilization rates increase, energy is used more efficiently, and the s ource of energy can often be renewable."
"Climate Research While enabling solutions to reduce energy and carbon emissions, AMD also aims to help researchers better understand the interrelated forces contributing to climate change and develop solutions to help mitigate the impacts."
"By analyzing massive and complex data sets, scientists can get insights into the causes of climate change and even predict the impacts of extreme weather to help save lives."
"For example, two of the AMD -powered Top 500 Supercomputers (June 2022) - theMeteoFrance supercomputer and the LUMI supercomputer in Finland - are usedfor weather and climate research."
Eco-Labels AMD works closely with Original Equipment Man ufacturers (OEMs) during product design and after product launch to increase the proportion of products meeting various eco -labels.
"As government agencies around the world look to incorporate sustainability requirements into their IT buying decisions, they utilize standards such as ENERGY STAR, EPEAT, TCO and others into their public procurement 35 IDC, Worldwide CO2 Emissions Savings from Cloud Computing Forecast, 2021 2024 : A First -of-Its-Kind Projection, Doc #US47426420, March 2021 48 [Public] tenders."
"Most eco -labels and certifications are evaluated at the system -level, (i.e., a computer or server), but the processor can play an important role in how wel l a system scores on a given standard."
"For example, AMD works with our customers to improve ENERGY STAR ratings by optimizing processor energy efficiency as measured at the system -level, in conjunction with other components and peripheral devices."
"EPEAT -registered products include environmental criteria such as supply chain greenhouse gas reductions, materials selection and environmental management system (EMS) certification."
"Supply Chain Responsibility Why It Matters With an estimated 76 percent of global trade passing through them, supply chains continue to be one of the most important levers for businesses to create a positive impact in the world.36 By working together, companies and their suppliers can make a significant impact on ad vancing human rights, fair labor practices and environmental progress."
"Over the last few years, o ur industry has experience d unprecedented demand for semiconductor technology, and this requires a strong supply chain."
T he link between resilient and respon sible supply chains is clear.
"Consequently, stakeholder expectations for transparency and data -driven results remain a focus in 2022."
"Together, with our supply chain and industry partners, AMD embraces the opportunity to help drive social and environmental progress in the supply chain."
"Although we adhere to the highest standards, we know the social and environmental risks in the supply chain are persistent and real."
With the growing number of electronic devices being used globally comes the responsibility to ensure that we are doing the right thing and conducting our business ethically.
"We are committed to delivering high -quality products and helping ensure that working conditions throughout our supply chain are safe, workers are treated with respect and di gnity and the manufacturing processes of our products are environmentally responsible."
"Our Approach As AMD is a fabless semiconductor company, our manufacturing operations depend on a carefully selected network of suppliers."
"The scope of the AMD Supply Chain Responsibility program encompasses the manufacturing of our products by suppliers, located in Asia, Europe and the United States, and the sourcing of raw materials."
"We aim to work with our manufacturing suppliers to advance supply chain resilience, respect for human rights and environmental sustainability."
We take a partnership approach with our suppliers to promote continuous improvement and drive positive change across our value chain.
Our value chain starts with the design process.
Our wafer foundry suppliers source raw materials and create a silicon wafer.
"The wafer is fabricated into chips, assembled into a package, tested and shipped as a semiconductor ready to be used by our customers."
The majority 36 https://www.trade.gov/supply -chain -services 49 [Public] approximately 61 percent of our supplier spend is with foundries that supply these wafers.
Another 26 percent of our spend is with factories that manufacture a range of inputs needed to create our products.
"This concentration of supplier spend allows us to take a long -term approach with key suppliers, which is paramount to our success."
"In our Supply Chain Respons ibility Supplier Guide, we share with our manufacturing suppliers our expectations and available resources."
"Our standard contractual terms and conditions for the procurement of goods and services require conformance to applicable laws and regulations, and we reinforce our expectations regarding responsible social, ethical and environmental conduct."
Training is made available to suppliers through the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)s e -Learning Academy.
Topics cover social and environmental issues and ar e assigned to suppliers based on identified knowledge gaps .
"AMD primary manufacturing suppliers include GlobalFoundries, Micron, Samsung Electronics, SPIL, SK Hynix, TF -AMD and TSMC."
50 [Public] Goals and Progre ss We a re expandi ng our work with suppliers to drive a positive impact for the people who work across our value chain and the planet which we all share.
Our goals include : together we advance _human rights Collaborating with RBA Members on Ethical Recruitment Training for Suppliers We believe we can have the most impact on addressing the systemic causes of forced and bonded labor by working with multi -stakeholder initiatives and leveraging relationships with our manufacturing suppliers.
"Through our membership in the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI), we share resources and tools with our suppliers to help address the root causes of this complex issue."
Migrant workers can be vulnerable to conditions of forced labor.
Collaboration with our suppliers on responsible recruitment is critical to meeting our requirements and international expectations of a ddressing forced labor risk.
"In 2021, with other RBA members, AMD co -sponsored the RLI Supplier Training on Responsible Recruitment Due Diligence."
We nominated select AMD sub -suppliers to attend the training.
"Aligned with the AMD Supplier Code of Conduct labor standards on freely chosen employment, the training provides practical guidance and tools for companies to implement responsible recruitment due diligence and follows the due diligence process developed by the Organisation for Economic Co -operation a nd Development (OECD)."
"The training focused on key risk areas in the recruitment of foreign migrant workers , which are: document retention, contract terms and conditions, and recruitment fees and related costs."
"As a result of their attendance, two AMD supp liers implemented training at their companies and updated their recruitment policies."
"Both companies also chose to train workers on their internal policies, rights and access to factory complaint channels."
"Combined, their trainings reached over 1,450 worke rs in 2021."
We continue to make this workshop available to AMD suppliers.
100 percent of AMD supplier manufacturing4 factories to have a Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) audit or equivalent by 2025.
"ON TRACK: Between 2020 and 2021, 64 percent of these supplier factories had an RBA audit."
80 percent of AMD manufacturing suppliers by spend to participate in a capacity -building activity by 2025.
"ON TRACK: 61 percent of these suppliers by spend participated in capacity -building activities in 2021, including ethical recruitment training."
51 [Public] Aligning with Industry Standards We hold ourselves to high ethical standards and expect our suppliers to do the same.
AMD is a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) .
"In 2021, AMD was elected to the Board of Directors to help guide the RBAs strategic direction to achieve its mission and vision."
"In addition, we collaborate with other industry groups, peers, suppliers and other stakeholders to make supply chains across the industry ethical and sustainable."
AMD adopts the RBA Code of Conduct as our Supplier Code of Conduct (The Code).
"The Code is aligned with international norms and standards including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ILO International Labour Standards and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprise s."
"It outlines our standards for labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems."
The AMD Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct outlines our expectations for our ethical conduct and these standards extend to our business partners.
"We further expect that each supplier will, in turn, communicate to their suppliers the same expectations and implement reasonable mechanisms to monitor thei r compliance."
"Read our RBA commitment letter How We Engage With Industry Groups Risk Assessment At AMD, we take a risk -based approach to managing our supply chain."
We utilize third -party risk analytics to conduct an overall supply chain risk analysis.
"Through our annual analysis, we gain deeper insights into inherent geographical risks in our supply chain on labor, health and safety, environment, business ethics and management systems."
We use the results of the analysis to assign risk assessment tools and prioritize suppliers within our audit program.
"In 2021, 99 percent of our manufacturing suppliers submitted the RBA supplier self -assessment questionnaire (SAQ)."
The score is an additional input used to assign a risk level to the supplier.
"Supplier Audits Based on the results of the risk assessment, AMD decides which tool will be most effective to evaluate the supplier based on its risk profile."
"For example, we may require an RBA Validated Assessment Program (VAP) on -site audit to learn more."
Suppliers identified as presenting a high risk of forced labor may be required to submit a specialized assessment designed to identify the risk of forced labor at the employment site.
"52 [Public] In 2021, 43 audits took place across Germany, Greater China, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and t he United States.37 The average i nitial RBA initial Validated Assessment Program (VAP) audit score for AMD suppliers in 2020 -2021 was 26 percent better than the overall RBA average over the same time period."
"See our Supplier Audit Summary Results Remediation We track audit findings, including nonconformances, from the release of the audit report through closure."
"As warrante d, suppliers are required to create a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) and submit it to AMD per the deadlines and requirements informed by the RBA VAP Protocol, including onsite third - party closure audits."
"When priority nonconformances are found, AMD contacts the supplier and requests details on the actions the site is implementing to immediately address the nonconformance (NC) prior to creating the longer -term CAP."
"Depending on the severity of the issue, discussions may be elevated for a more in -depth conversa tion between company executives."
"Regardless, if a supplier is not following the RBA CAP closure timeline, AMD executives will be informed for appropriate action."
Accountability We use supplier scorecards to hold suppliers accountable for their perform ance against AMD supply chain responsibility expectations.
AMD employees from the Procurement and Corporate Responsibility teams participate in supplier business reviews which include a discussion on the scorecard.
"Performance metrics include: Social and environmental commitment and management RBA audit performance Timely closure of nonconformance, if any Environmental management and performance In 2021, 100 percent of AMD Sourcing Managers completed an updated training on supply chain responsibility which included training on forced labor risks in the supply chain and best practices in supplier performance incentives."
"37 Data reflects initial and closure audits in the AMD supply chain that took place in the 2021 calendar year up to December 31, 2021."
"53 [Public] Respecting Human Rights At AMD, we respect human rights throughout our company, operations and supply chain."
"We work to uphold the relevant fundamental rights and freedoms of all people across the business, aligned with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Labour Organizations (ILOs) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises."
"In 2021, we u pdated our Human Rights Policy to reflect our commitment to the UNGPs."
This policy extends to our supply chain and the AMD Supplier Code of Conduct further incorporates human rights requirements expressed in international norms and standards.
"We are a sign atory to the United Nations Global Compact , the worlds largest corporate sustainability initiative, affirming our commitment to aligning our strategy and operations to ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti -corruption."
"In 2022, AMD acquired Xilinx."
"As a result, new suppliers are being incorporated into the AMD Supply Chain R esponsibility Program, and we continue to take steps to further operationalize our Human Rights Policy."
"Read our Human Rights Policy Assessing Impact and Opportunities The AMD Corporate Responsibility and Procurement teams are responsible for establishing and coordinating the policies, programs and processes governing our approach to human rights."
"In our most recent materiality assessment , we identified salient human rights risks, includi ng forced labor and child labor in the supply chain."
"Our efforts to identify human rights risks and impacts, if they occur, include a thoughtful selection of AMD suppliers and due diligence within our supply chain."
"Through assessments of manufacturing suppliers, we have identified working hours and health and safety as salient human rights risks."
"Unfortunately, in the electronics supply chain, some workers are at risk of conditions that contribute to forced labor including recruitment fe es, unethical recruitment practices and a lack of transparency about their actual working conditions."
Migrants and other vulnerable workers are particularly at risk.
We require suppliers to commit to freely chosen employment and monitor risks that could le ad to forced labor conditions.
"Our Supplier Code of Conduct includes a standard on freely chosen labor, including prohibiting workers from paying recruitment fees."
Supply chain due diligence is an ongoing process.
"We continuously work toward preventing, de tecting and remediating forced labor, if found in our supply chain."
See Our Supplier Summary Audit Results Read our Statement on Human Trafficking and Forced Labor Stakeholder Engagement 54 [Public] Stakeholder expectations related to the supply chain continue to evolve.
One example is the convergence of human rights and product compliance.
We believe collective action drives greater impact than one company acting alone.
"For this reason, multi -stakehol der partnerships are an important aspect of managing our supply chain responsibility."
"AMD is a regular member of the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI) , an initiative of the RBA."
"Through our membership, we partner with industry and stakeholders to harmonize a cross -industry approach to address the root cause of forced labor and accelerate change."
"We also work with our suppliers and our industry through the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) to ensure the responsible sourcing of raw minerals, focusing on those from Conflict -Affected and High -Risk Areas."
"The RMI is a central actor that helps members advance responsible mineral sourcing by promoting common tools, assessments and training for the electronics industry and beyond."
We encourage our suppliers to utilize RMI tools and best practices to ensure industry alignment across the value chain.
We continuously seek opportunities to align wit h best practices in how we operate and collaborate with our suppliers to respect and uphold human rights through our supply chain.
"Environmental Sustainability in Our Supply Chain We are steadfast in our commitment to environmental sustainability, and that includes working with our manufacturing suppliers to evaluate and continuously improve performance."
"Given the amount of energy and water needed in the wafer fabricating process, silicon wafer manufacturing represents the bulk of ou r environmental footprint in our supply chain."
"We have set 2025 performance metrics for our wafer foundry suppliers, and track progress each quarter."
"In addition, we track water use, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste across 89 percent (by spen d) of our manufacturing suppliers."
"See our Supply Chain Goals and Initiatives Supplier Spotlight TSMC Advances Environmental and Social Responsibility Advanced silicon wafers are at the core of AMD technology, each with billions of transistors."
These cutting -edge wafers are manufactured at world -class wafer foundry operations known as fabs.
"As semiconductor processes continue to become more complex advancing from 2D structures to a 3D FinFET architecture it is increasingly important to minimize the use of non -renewable energy, water and chemicals."
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was the worlds first dedicated semiconductor found ry and is a primary wafer supplier to AMD.
The foundry i s the only semiconductor company chosen for the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for 21 consecutive years.
Its accomplishments and our work together help to advance AMD supply chain goals.
"55 [Public] TSMC was t he first in the industry to sign up to the RE100 renewable energy initiative, pledging to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 as part of its Net Zero goal."
"In the near term, the company aims to increase its ren ewable energy usage to 40 percent by 203038 as well as save 1.1. billion kWh of electricity and 28 million tons of water.39 TSMC has established various water recycling applications through water resource risk management, expansion of diverse water sources and the development of pollution prevention techniques."
"As a leader, it built the worlds first water reclamation plant for industrial effluents and was the world's first semiconductor company to receive Platinum Certification with the highest score for three consecutive years to the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS).40 TSMC is also committed to advancing social issues, including diversity and inclusion."
"TS MC enables its 60,000+ employees to thrive through initiatives to diversify communication channels, expand learning resources and promote career development."
"In 2021, TSMC launched the TSMC Global Employee - Engagement Survey to gauge overall employee sentim ent."
"With a response rate of 93 percent, the results indicated employees recognized the companys continuous pursuit of organizational effectiveness and provided areas of improvement, including management training on supporting employees to unleash their p otential.41 Health and Safety for Workers in our Supply Chain We value the health and safety of workers in our supply chain."
"With our two primary wafer foundry suppliers, we aim to see a year -over -year reduction of the cumulative reportable injury and ill ness case rate."
"In 2021, the rate decreased by 50 percent compared to 2020."
"Extending to our other manufacturing suppliers, we utilize RBA audits to identify health and safety code violations, which most often relate to emergency preparedness."
See our Supplier Audit Summary Results Responsible Minerals Sourcing AMD is committed to the responsible sourcing of minerals used in our products and expects our suppliers to conduct business in accordance with the AMD Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct .
"Tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG), commonly referred to as conflict minerals, are used in consumer goods and are integral to electronic products."
"The mining, sale and use of minerals from Confli ct- Affected and High -Risk Areas (CAHRAs), including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, have been associated with negative social and environmental impacts."
This includes the funding of violent groups associated with committing hu man rights abuses.
Our efforts to break the link between the minerals trade and conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo began in 2008.
"Through industry initiatives and collaboration with our supply chain partners, we 38 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021 -12-08/tsmc -leads -rush -for-renewables -ahead -of-taiwan -energy -vote 39 https://esg.tsmc.com/en/update/greenManufacturing/caseStudy/56/index.html 40 https://esg.tsmc.com/en/update/greenManufacturing/caseStudy/47/index.html 41 https://esg.tsmc.com/en/update/inclusiveWorkplace/caseStudy/29/index.html 56 [Public] work to support the responsib le sourcing of minerals from CAHRAs."
Our view and insight into the minerals supply chain have developed beyond 3TG to include cobalt.
"As we learn more about potential social and environmental impacts, we continue to assess our supply chain and have priorit ized minerals for additional due diligence."
"Multi -stakeholder Collaboration As part of our approach to responsible sourcing, we support the enablement of ethical, social and environmental sourcing through ongoing multi -stakeholder programs and dialogue."
AMD has been a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) since it was founded in 2008.
"Through RMI, we connect with industry members, governments, non-profits and other stakeholders to contribute to mitigate the salient social and environmental impacts of the extraction and processing of minerals used in supply chains."
"The RMI is a central actor that helps members advance responsible mi neral sourcing by creating common tools, assessments and training for the electronics industry and beyond."
We encourage our supply chain to utilize RMI tools and best practices to ensure industry alignment across the value chain.
Our Approach Our approach is based on the five steps of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict -Affected and High -Risk Areas (OECD Guidance).
These steps include: 1.
"Establishing strong management systems: Our Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct , Supplier Code of Conduct , Human Rights Policy and Responsible Minerals Policy (previously referred to as Conflict Minerals Policy) govern responsible mineral sourcing initiatives at AMD."
"These policies are aligned wi th international frameworks, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Labour Organization standards and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises."
2.
"Identifying and assessing risks: Transparency is critical to a responsible, res ilient supply chain."
"Each year, AMD works with our suppliers to identify the relevant smelters and refiners within our supply chain utilizing the RMIs reporting templates, such as the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT)."
We compare those smelters and refiners to the list of facilities that conform to RMIs Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP).
This information is used to identify potential risks associated with our mineral supply chain.
3.
Managing risks: Tracing materials to the point of extraction is a complex challenge.
We leverage our participation in RMI to encourage smelters or refiners to participate in RMAP to ensure responsible parti es conduct due diligence on materials purchased from mining companies or mineral traders and implement corrective actions to comply with industry standards.
Disengaging with a supplier can have unintended economic and humanitarian consequences for local co mmunities.
AMD has strong partnerships with our suppliers we work together to 57 [Public] assess the impacts of disengaging from raw material sources that do not meet industry and AMD requirements.
"It is our goal to support improvement, not disengagement."
4.
"Assessmen ts: Through RMI, AMD supports independent third -party assessments of smelters and refiners management systems and sourcing practices that are validated to conform to industry standards such as RMAP standards ."
5.
Reporting: We publish an annual Conflict Mi nerals Report that details our mineral sourcing due diligence initiative.
"Our Progress In 2021, our progress centered around continuous improvement."
We worked to enhance existing processes to maintain our commitment to AMD customers and promote industry standards for responsible sourcing.
Our program will remain focused on mitigating social and environmental risks associated with the raw materials supply chain of AMD products.
"We have expanded our program beyond 3TG and cobalt, and we continue to identify opportunities to work proactively to map our supply chain and prioritize risk mitigation actions."

"The Code of Conduct is a set of social, environmental and ethical industry standards encompassing many frameworks, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Labour Organization standards, OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and ISO and social accountability standards."
"We believe this industry -wide standard is an efficient and effective way to integrate social, environmental and ethical responsibilities into our supply chain."
The RBA Code is reviewed and updated every three years by RBA members and stakeholders to ensure its applicability to international norms and relevant supply chain issues.
"AMD expects our suppliers, as well as ourselves, to operate in accordance with the Code of Conduct and its expectations and requirements, whic h span labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems."
"Elements of the RBA Code: Labor Freely chosen employment Young workers Working hours Wages and benefits Humane treatment Non -discrimination/Non -harassment Freedom of association Health and Safety Occupational safety Emergency preparedness Occupational injury and illness Industrial hygiene Physically demanding work Machine safeguarding Sanitation, food and housing Health and safety communication Environment Environmental permits and reporting Pollution prevention and resource reduction Hazardous substances Solid waste Air emissions Materials restrictions Water management Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions 59 [Public] Ethics Business integrity No improper advantage Disclosure of information Intellectual property Fair business, advertising and competition Protection of identity and non -retaliation Responsible sourcing of minerals Privacy Management Systems Company commitment Management accountability and responsibility Legal and customer requirements Risk assessment and risk management Improvement objectives Training Communication Worker feedback, participation and grievance Audits and assessments Corrective action process Documentation and records Supplier responsibility Read about the Responsible Business Alliance Supplier Audit Summary Results Overview AMD manufacturing suppliers and some sub -tier suppliers are audited to verify compliance with the AMD Supplier Code of Conduct ."
"In 2021, we saw an increase in the number of audits compared to 2020."
"This increase was due to the easing of COVID -19 pandemic restrictions allowing more in person interaction, making it possible for the audits to take place."
"With this increase in audits, there was a proportional increase in the overall identification of nonconformances (NCs) or findings."
We are using this data to inform the types of capacity building initiatives we are offering to our suppliers.
The average i nitial RBA initial Validated Assessment Program (VAP) audit score for AMD suppliers in 2020 -2021 was 26 percent better than the overall RBA average over the same time period.
"In 2021, 32 initial VAP audits were conducted at manufacturing supplier and sub -tier supplier factories in the AMD supply chain."
"The majority of audits took place in the region where we have the highest number of suppliers, Greater China ."
"Additionally, 81 percent of AMD supplier manufacturing factories were eligible for the VAP Recognition Program , which means the RBA recognized them for their 60 [Public] commitment to soci al and environmental responsibility.42 At the end of 2021, the top 70 percent of all suppliers in our supply chain, by spend, have the highest level of VAP recognition status."
AMD wafer suppliers continue to score the highest audit score possible: 200.
"Add itionally, workers in AMD supply chain score a 60.1 on RBAs Quality of Life Metric43 compared to the industry average of 49.9."
"This metric is based on three indicators: availability of money (having more than is needed to pay their bills), time (to focus on things they enjoy) and good health (in order to enjoy the time and money)."
The sco re is calculated by isolating questions in the VAP audits that measured these three indicators.
The average number of VAP audit findings in the electronics industry is 8.6 per audit.
AMD suppliers average number of findings in 2021 was 2.7.
"The VAP au dit categorizes NCs or findings by severity, as Minor, Major or Priority."
"Of all NCs in our supply chain in 2021, six Priority NCs were identified (up from two in 2020), representing 6 percent of all NCs during this time frame."
"In 2021, 66 percent o f all NCs in our supply chain were classified as Major NCs."
All affected suppliers were required to complete a corrective action plan for the identified issues.
"Major NCs44 included: Working hours Freely chosen employment Occupational safety Emergency preparedness Wages and benefits Supplier responsibility Food, sanitation and housing Across the five sections of the VAP, labor (specifically working hours) represented the highest number findings."
This corresponds with VAPs across the electronics industry.
"In 2020, RBA analyzed the number of working hours comparing RBA -member and non - member factories."
"The analysis concluded that on average, workers in RBA member facilities work four fewer hours per week than their counterparts in non - member facilities.45 Remediation All three categories have specified periods during which the facility in question must remedy the findings and implement systems to prevent reoccurrences."
As part of the corrective action plan (CAP) process suppliers are provided access to free RBA e -learn ing lessons related to the audit findings.
"When priority NCs are found, AMD contacts the supplier requesting details on the actions the site is implementing to immediately address the NC prior to creating the longer -term CAP."
"Throughout the process, AMD co mmunicates with the supplier to review the CAP and provide support, when necessary."
42 Data includes all AMD manufacturing suppliers with eligible VAP Recognition Program data in 2020 -2022.
VAPs are valid for two years.

"Labor represented 39 percent of all NCs in our companys supply chain in 2021, however only one was a p riority NC."
"Regardless, a ll suppliers were required to complete corrective actions for identified issues."
Factories continued to face the challenge of keeping up with demand while implementing COVID -19 safety protocols in 2021.
"As such, the highest rate of NCs occurred in working hours."
"In response, we communicated to all of our manufacturing suppliers and some sub -tier suppliers the importance of upholding the labor standards contained in the 46 A Closure Audit verifies whether findings from a previous audit have been addressed and not all findings require a closure audit."
62 [Public] AMD Code of Conduct and included resources from the ILO and RBA on managing the impact of COVID - 19 on migrant workers.
NCs in the category of freely chosen employment were due to workers paying fees prohibited by the Code or suppliers lacking sufficient policies or management practices to prevent the risk of forced labor.
"These findings were escalated to senior executives of AMD, and we worked directly with the manufacturing and sub -tier suppliers to ensure remediation was provided to the affected workers and systems were put in place to prevent future NCs."
These sup pliers were also identified as candidates for additional capacity building initiatives.
Two suppliers attended a virtual workshop on best practices in ethical recruitment and due diligence.
The other suppliers were provided e -learning courses on forced labor prevention or ethical recruitment due diligence.
"Read More About Supplier Training Opportunities Health and Safety Approximately 35 percent of all NCs in our supply chain in 2021 were in the area of health and safety (down from 43 percent in 2020) , with the majority of the issues related to emergency preparedness, occupational safety and injury and illness."
"Most of the NCs were in emergency preparedness specifically a lack of adequate fire detection, emergency exits or certification , or identification of all potential emergencies that could affect the site with adequate, established response programs ."
"Immediate containment action was completed within the RBA timeline, and closure audits were completed where required."

Our value chain emissions are estimated following the gu idance from the GHG protocol.
"Category 1: Emissions associated with Foundry and OSAT suppliers are calculated using Scope 1 and 2 emissions collected from top suppliers, allocated to AMD, and extrapolated to account for suppliers that do not disclose their emissions."
Emissions upstream of AMDs Foundry suppliers are then estimated using a manufacturing LCA index specific to AMDs highest volume products.
"Emissions from all other vendors (including marketing, professional services, real estate, software prov iders, telecom and networking providers and other manufacturing services) are calculated using a spend - based method."
"Category 3: Emissions are calculated using fuel and electricity consumption data collected from our sites globally, and emission factors fr om DEFRA and IEA."
"Category 4: emissions are estimated using a hybrid methodology combining supplier -specific emissions reported by two of our major shipping providers and a mode -specific, spend -based calculation on all other logistics spend."
Category 5: Da ta is collected from our sites globally and emissions are calculated using DEFRA factors per waste type and waste disposal method.
"Category 6: Emissions are from air travel only and are provided by our travel agency, in accordance with the GHG Protocol."
Category 7: Emissions are based on survey data from our 5 largest campuses are calculated using a distance -based method for average distance traveled and mode.
Emissions are adjusted to reflect the proportion of employees working on -site during 2021.
"Categor y 11: Emissions are calculated based on total sales volume, average product electricity consumption, and average product lifetime split by product category for all products sold in 2021."
Country -specific IEA emission factors are used to calculate emissions resulting from product use.
A given percentage of server -related products are assumed to be powered with renewable electricity based on data center customer data.
Category 12: Emissions are calculated based on the average product weight by product categor y and the total sales volume within 2021.
"A weight -based calculation is used, with the disposal method estimated using region -specific e -waste recycling, landfilling, and incineration benchmarks."
Emission factors associated with e -waste treatment are obtai ned from the EPA.
