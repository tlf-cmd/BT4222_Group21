The antitrust and compliance teams investigate any conduct suspected to violate antitrust laws and the Code of Conduct.
Employees in violation face repercussions ranging from intensive retraining to termination.
"Global tax policy Verizon is a responsible taxpayer that timely and accurately files all applicable tax returns, pays all applicable taxes and accurately reports taxes in our financial statements."
We are committed to maintaining a transparent and positive working relationship with tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
"We also partner with tax authorities and governments to advocate for tax guidance and legislation that provides clarity, is administrable, reduces tax disputes and is socially and fiscally responsible."
Risk management and governance .
"Verizon has implemented formal tax governance policies, procedures and controls that strive to meet or exceed best practices on tax governance."
"Our tax control framework is SOX-compliant and subject to periodic review by the Senior Vice President & Deputy General Counsel Corporate Taxes, Verizon Internal Audit and our external auditors."
"Verizons tax principles, and compliance with them, are overseen by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, as well as the Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel."
Policy approach.
Verizons Global Tax Policy provides that Verizon only engages in transactions that are supported by a non-tax business purpose.
"As such, we only operate in jurisdictions based on the needs of the business and the requirements of our multinational customers."
We do not utilize zero or low tax jurisdictions outside the U.
"S. to minimize our taxes, and we do not engage in tax shelter transactions or transactions that have been identified as listed transactions or transactions o f interest by the IRS and other taxing authorities."
"In addition, Verizons transfer pricing policies are based on the arms length principle and compliance with guidelines and documentation requirements set by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate."
"15 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Political contributions and engagement We participate in the policymaking process at the federal, state and local levels in order to inform public officials of Verizo ns views on policy issues."
"Government policies can have a significant impact on our business, whether they involve decisions on taxes, technology regulation or consumer issues like protecting user privacy and stopping illegal robocalls."
"We participate in these conversations so that government decision-makers understand how these policies could affect Verizon and our customers, employees and shareholders."
Lobbying.
"As part of our advocacy, we engage in lobbying at all levels of government through our own employees and through outside consultants."
"Our Public Policy and Government Affairs organization approves any engagement of lobbyists on behalf of Verizon, and we strictly comply with all lobbying laws requiring disclosure of our activities and expenses."
Political contributions.
Political contributions are one way we support the democratic electoral process and participate in the policy dialogue.
"Verizon makes political contributions where law permits and also operates several political action committees (PACs) that support candidates at the federal, state and local levels."
"All contributions by Verizon and our PACs are made to promote the interests of the company, our shareholders and our customers and without regard to the personal political interests of Verizon executives."
"We support candidates of any political party who share our key strategic business and policy priorities, even if we do not agree with them on every issue."
We do not make corporate political contributions or PAC contributions to presidential candidates or federal SuperPACs.
Third-party organizations.
We also make our voice heard through participation in trade associations and by supporting advocacy organizations.
"Verizon supports these organizations for a variety of reasons: to deepen our relationships in our communities, take advantage of industry expertise or collaborate on common goals and interests in key strategic policy and business issues."
We participate in these organizations despite the fact that we may not always agree with all of the positions of each organization or its other members.
"These groups often have a diversity of members, interests and viewpoints that may not always reflect Verizons beliefs or priorities."
We monitor our participation in these organizations to confirm ongoing alignment with our corporate values and goals.
"When we disagree with a position of an organization we support, we attempt to communicate our concerns through the senior executives that interact with these organizations."
"Governance, transparency and disclosure."
"Verizon participates in policy dialogues with appropriate governance, oversight and transparency mechanisms to mitigate reputational risk."
Verizons political activity is directly overseen by the Legal and Public Policy and Government Affairs organizations.
All of our political activity is subject to robust internal controls set forth in our Code of Conduct and other corporate policies.
"The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee of our Board oversees our participation in the political process, including political giving, memberships in trade associations and reputational risk, an d receives a comprehensive briefing on these activities at least annually."
"Verizon understands that transparency regarding our political engagement is critical to maintaining the trust of our employees, shareholders and the public, so we publish our Political Engagement Report twice a year."
"This report describes our current policy priorities and lists all of our PAC contributions, corporate political contributions, support for ballot ini tiatives and independent expenditures for the period covered."
"This report also discloses trade associations and tax-exempt organizations (501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) organizations) to which our Public Policy and Government Affairs organization provided support of at least $50,000."

18 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix TCFD summary We know that transparency regarding climate-related risks and opportunities is critical to maintaining the trust of our stakeholders.
"To provide a comprehensive view of how we understand and manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change at Verizon, we have published two standalone reports aligned with the guidelines of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)."
This summary highlights information provided in our TCFD reporting.
"For more detailed information, see our latest TCFD report."
Board oversight.
Our Board of Directors oversees Verizons strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities directly and through its committees.
"The Corporate Governance and Policy Committee, which oversees corporate responsibility, sustainability and public policy, monitors our progress on meeting climate-related goals."
"The Audit Committee, which oversees Verizons enterprise risk management program, reviews network reliability, energy and emissions management and climate-related regulation during annual business risk reviews."
The Finance Committee oversees our renewable energy purchase agreements and green finance program.
Management responsibility.
Verizons Executive Climate Oversight Committee has direct responsibility for assessing our climate-related risks and opportunities and recommending changes or enhancements to our strategy.
"Representatives from ESG, Fleet, Global Real Estate, Network, Strategy, Sustainability and Treasury report into the Committee on climate-related issues and initiatives that fall within their purview."
"The Responsible Business Council, Strategic Leadership Council, Verizon Leadership Council and Board of Directors are regularly updated on our strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities and our progress in meeting our climate-related targets."
Risk identification and management.
"We have several processes that help us proactively identify, assess and prepare for potential climate-related risks, including a formal enterprise risk management program, processes to monitor domestic and international regulatory developments and a comprehensive business continuity planning framework and program."
"Our annual Business Impact Analysis (BIA) assessment identifies, reviews and prioritizes threats to our employees, network and business operations based on known and predicted events, including five climate-related events: storm surge from hurricanes, flooding, wildfire, high straight-line wind and tornadoes."
"The BIA highlights necessary investments to harden infrastructure and helps inform our business continuity planning, network build and capital allocation decisions."
We are also integrating longer term climate-related risks into our planning tools.
"Using geospatial analysis, we overlay longterm climate projections from third-party sources onto our current and future operational and network models."
"In 2021, we conducted a supplemental forward-looking physical risk analysis across a variety of acute climate-related perils to assess future impacts."
Strategy.
Verizons business strategy is centered around maintaining world-class networks.
"To mitigate the potential effects of transition and physical climate-related risks on our business, we are: Maximizing the energy efficiency of our networks and facilities and transitioning to renewable energy."
Reducing waste and responsibly managing natural resources.
Developing solutions to help our customers transition to a low-carbon economy.
Upgrading and hardening our infrastructure to be prepared for a changing climate.
These activities are described in more detail in the sections below and in our latest TCFD report.
"19 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Our path to operational net zero Because most of our operational carbon footprint comes from the electricity we use to power our networks, our path to operational net zero is focused on two key drivers: maximizing the energy efficiency of our networks and facilities and transitioning to renewable energy."
"While we expect our energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives to bring us close to achieving operational net zero, we will eventually need to purchase carbon offsets for the remaining emissions that we cannot eliminate directly."
Improving energy efficiency We continue to improve energy efficiency across our networks and facilities.
"For example, we are migrating copper-based services to fiber technologies, which allows us to decommission switches and activate newer intelligent edge network platforms."
Our fiber-delivered broadband services are at least 100 times more efficient on a kilowatt hour (KwH) per gigabyte basis than copper-delivered broadband services.
4 Network cooling We implement a variety of interventions targeting network cooling to further maximize energy efficiency.
"These interventions reduce overall site energy usage and maintenance costs, as well as extend the life expectancy of our equipment."
We optimize settings at our network facilities to reduce cooling system demand.
These adjustments are based on well-established industry guidelines and have no detrimental effect on network performance or reliability.
We also deploy artificial intelligence (AI) solutions across a number of technical network facilities to enhance cooling system capacity and telecommunications equipment capabilities.
"We are in the process of replacing and upgrading older cooling systems with newer, high-efficiency systems that meet or exceed the latest industry energy-efficiency standards."
"These upgrades include systems equipped with free cooling economizers, which bring outside air into the HVAC system when it is cooler outside than inside, significantly reducing cooling energy consumption."
Data centers We design and operate our data centers for optimal energy efficiency.
"Our data centers leverage the full range of environmental tolerances allowed by most server, storage and network hardware suppliers, enabling us to implement energy-saving practices such as free cooling, waterside economizers, evaporative cooling, aisle containment and passive exhaust."
We also leverage the full limits of our power and cooling infrastructure by monitoring and managing the power demand profile at each layer of distribution.
"In some locations, we use AI machine learning algorithms to support energy conservation."
"Social Appendix For the 10th consecutive year, the EPA named Verizon an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year and again recognized us with a Sustained Excellence designation."
20 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Administrative and technical buildings Verizon is proud to partner with the U.
S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ENERGY STAR program by pursuing ENERGY STAR certification for 100% of our eligible facilities.
"We have achieved 668 ENERGY STAR certifications for our properties since 2001 by implementing new retail store designs, upgrading lighting, maintaining space temperatures, improving building controls and managing equipment maintenance routines."
"For the 10th consecutive year, the EPA named Verizon an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year and again recognized us with a Sustained Excellence designation."
Verizon has completed 359 LEED-certified projects since 2009.
"5 As part of our energy efficiency strategy, we are replacing inefficient lighting across our building portfolio with light-emitting diode (LED) lighting."
We are developing on-site green energy generation at our administrative offices and other facilities.
"In 2022, we installed new solar photovoltaic systems at our key administrative hubs in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and Irving, Texas, as well as at a key technical facility in Rocklin, California."
"A Garden City, New York, installation is nearly complete."
We plan on continuin g to commission on-site renewable energy generation in the coming years and have several additional sites in design.
"Since 2013, we have installed 37.6 megawatts (MW) of on-site green energy generation currently in operation at our facilities."
"6 In addition to contributing to the achievement of our climate-related goals, our on-site solar installations are a powerful signal to our employees and communities of Verizons dedication to sustainability."
Fleet We are taking a variety of approaches to reduce our fleet emissions.
"In addition to transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs), w e are developing solutions and using equipment that enable us to reduce the number of fleet vehicle dispatches to customer premises."
"Fleet fuel consumption 7 25.0 24.3 Millions of gallons 22.2 19.4 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 2020 2021 2022 Although we primarily rely on internal combustion engine vehicles, our fleet also includes hybrid, light-duty pickup trucks and first-of-their-kind hybrid vans."
"Over the last several years, we have purchased many small bucket trucks to replace aging equipment and outfitted them with battery systems to drive the aerial lift used to perform work on our infrastructure, thus eliminating the need for the trucks engine to be on."
We have also downsized many of the engines in replacement vans and recalibrated software in older vans to improve fuel economy without compromising the vehicles functional abilities.
We are in the process of transforming our fleet from relying on internal combustion engines to using clean energy technologies.
"As part of this effort, we are planning to electrify a substantial portion of our customer-facing fleet through suitable light-duty EVs."
"We are also prioritizing the design and construction of charging stations at locations owned, or leased on a long-term basis, by Verizon that house the largest concentrations of fleet vehicles."
21 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental The lack of EV models suitable for commercial operations poses a challenge to our fleet electrification.
"While production of light-duty EV s is increasing to meet a variety of consumer uses, there are few, if any, options for the larger, specialized, commercial EVs on which our operations depend."
"We are closely collaborating with manufacturers and actively participating in industry organizations to sp ur the manufacture of special-use-case commercial EVs in order to electrify our non-cust omer facing light-duty vehicles, as well as our medium- and heavy-duty operational vehicles, to the greatest extent practicable."
"We are also collaborating with manufacturers, utilities and fellow fleet operators to discuss opportunities to more rapidly transition our fleet to low- or zero-carbon alternatives, as well as develop and implement best practices in making such a transition."
"To support the adoption of programs and policies that advance commercial fleet decarbonization efforts, Verizon is an active member of the National Association of Fleet Administrators, the Advanced Energy Group, the General Motors EV Vision Board, the National Truck Equipment Associations Green Truck Association and the Corporate Electric Vehicle Alliance."
"Employee EV charging To encourage our V Teamers to use EVs with ease and confidence, we provide access to EV charging at 76 Verizon locations."
"Transitioning to renewable energy Because the electricity that powers our networks is responsible for most of Verizons emissions, our support of renewable energy and the transition to a greener grid is a key enabler to achieving our 2035 operational net zero goal."
"In 2021, we joined the Clean Energy Buyers Association to support the transition to a cleaner, more prosperous, zero-carbon energy future."
Our network operations are located across the country and require a constant supply of electricity.
"As it is not feasible to power our network operations directly from solar or wind generation facilities during every hour of every day, we are dependent on sourcing power from our nations electrical grids."
"Today, much of that is brown power, produced from conventional fossil fuels such as coal and oil."
"To achieve our interim renewable energy targets and long-term operational net zero goal, we are helping to accelerate the transition to greener electrical grids across the U."
S. We are working to bring additional renewable energy to the grids by entering into long term power purchase agreements for solar and wind power under development.
"The agreements, called virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), are financially settled and can help reduce Verizons long-term exposure to energy price volatility."
"VPPAs provide the developers of renewable energy facilities with long-term revenue certainty, enabling them to obtain the capital they need to construct new solar and wind energy facilities."
We generally do not expect to take physical delivery of the energy from a facility under a VPPA.
"Rather, the facility operator sells the energy into the wholesale market, and we typically receive the renewable energy credits (RECs) associated with the energy sold."
We retire these RECs against our actual energy consumption to track our progress toward meeting our renewable energy targets and our operational net zero goal.
Social Appendix Verizon expects to source renewable energy equivalent to 100% of our annual electricity usage by 2030.
"22 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix As of February 10, 2023, Verizon has in place 26 long-term VPPAs for a total of approximately 3.3 gigawatts (GW) of anticipated renewable energy capacity, making us a leading corporate buyer of renewable energy in the U."
"S. As of such date, seven projects related to our VPPAs are in commercial operation."
"We have contracted for approximately 0.8 GW of the generating capacity of these projects, which represents nearly 25% of the anticipated aggregate capacity of our VPPA portfolio."
The remaining projects are under development.
"The additional renewable energy capacity that we have contracted for is expected to enable the avoidance of over 4.1 million metric tons (MT) of CO 2e annually, an amount equivalent to removing 890,000 passenger vehicles from the road on an annual basis.8 We believe that the VPPAs that we have signed position us to exceed our 2025 renewable energy target."
We will continue to identify new projects under development as we work toward our 2030 renewable energy target and 2035 operational net zero goal.
"Green financing We continue to seek ways to integrate sustainability considerations into our corporate finance processes, including through capital raising, investor communications and impact reporting."
Verizon is one of the largest corporate green bond issuers in the U.
S. Our green bond program is instrumental to our efforts to meet our interim renewable energy targets and long-term operational net zero goal.
"As of February 2023, we have issued a total of $4 billion in green bonds since 2019 and allocated the net proceeds primarily to VPPAs for new renewable energy projects."
Our Green Financing Framework articulates our sustainable finance strategy and explains how our intended use of proceeds and selection of projects supports our environmental goals and advances the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).
"Our Green Financing Framework also includes a pledge to only engage underwriters for our green bond transactions, which have established clear and impactful commitments in support of the UN SDGs, are a diverse-owned firm or have a core mission of promoting DEI."
Our annual Green Bond Impact Report details the allocation of green bond proceeds and related impacts.
23 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizons emissions profile Verizon has voluntarily disclosed the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our operational energy consumption (scope 1 and 2) since 2004.
2019 was the first year for which we reported our value chain (scope 3) emissions.
"Scope 1: All direct sources of emissions owned or controlled by Verizon, with the main categories being fuel to power our fleet, heat our buildings and power our backup generators."
Scope 2: Indirect emissions from energy purchased by Verizon.
"The main category is electricity to power our networks and data centers, plus a small amount of steam and heat purchased to heat our buildings."
"Scope 3: Indirect emissions associated with Verizons upstream and downstream value chain, including emissions resulting from purchased goods and services, use of sold products and employee business travel."

"Our Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) and Circular Supply Chain teams work internally across the company and externally with partners and vendors to reduce, reuse and responsibly recycle materials."
"We recycled or reused approximately 45.8 million pounds of materials, excluding e-waste, in 2022."
"12 E-waste: reducing, reusing and recycling Verizon defines electronic waste, or e-waste, as electronic products and component parts that are at the end of their useful life and/or have been returned by customers."
"E-waste generated by our business operations includes cell phones, chargers, set-top boxes, network equipment, batteries and associated plastic components."
"In 2022, Verizon reused or recycled approximately 43.4 million pounds of e-waste, including 1.6 million pounds of plastic and 2.7 million pounds of lead-acid batteries."
13 We strive to divert 100% of e-waste from landfills by reusing or responsibly recycling materials.
"To the extent practicable, we reuse electronic products and parts internally."
"When internal reuse is not possible, we market these materials for reuse through approved vendors or work with partners to responsibly recycle them."
Verizons Circular Supply Chain team partners with Corporate Sourcing to incorporate terms into our vendor contracts for the responsible end-of-life management of our products.
"Verizons device trade-in program supports our efforts to repurpose, reuse or recycle all of the devices and accessories that we receive back from consumers."
"The program lets both Verizon and non-Verizon consumers return qualifying, pre-owned mobile and other electronic devices in exchange for a Verizon credit or gift card."
Consumers can also return obsolete devices for recycling.
"In addition, we refurbish and redistribute to customers our home internet devices for 4G and 5G fixed wireless access and Fios service."
Many of Verizons recycling practices exceed regulatory mandates.
We engage e-waste vendors that manage our waste in accordance with high industry standards for environmental stewardship such as R2 and e-Stewards.
Our practice is to require lead-acid batteries from our U.
S. operations to be sent to Verizon-approved recycling facilities in the U.
S. or Canada and to require our vendors to provide certificates of recycling for the batteries.
"We regularly audit facilities, including bat tery smelters, that manage Verizons hazardous or regulated waste."
"Reducing plastic and other waste We are working to reduce plastics in our products and product packaging, as well as in our day-to-day business operations."
Our plastic reduction efforts include: Producing a Fios business router with post-consumer waste (PCW) recycled plastic resin.
"Eliminating single-use plastic packaging from one of our reverse logistics operations (i.e., product take-back)."
"Products impacted by this change include home routers, optical network terminals and set-top boxes."

48 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Employee engagement We view employee engagement as a strategic lever directly tied to business performance.
Annual employee survey process.
"Verizon partners with Gallup, an industry leader in workplace analytics and insights, to conduct quarterly surveys that capture global employee sentiment and track progress around our engagement goals."
"We strongly encourage all of our employees to participate in these regular surveys, which solicit feedback on a range of issues relating to workplace culture and business strategies."
Our Chief Human Resources Officer shares the top-line results of each quarterly survey with our Board and senior leadership and also communicates these results to all employees via a company webcast.
"Q1 survey Gauges understanding of how individual work aligns with company and business unit goals Q2 survey Measures employee sentiment on leadership, inclusion, values and empowerment Annual employee survey cycleQ4 survey Solicits employee feedback on topical issues such as workplace culture and remote work Q3 survey Assesses managerial accountability for customized team action plans VZPulse+ survey."
"Our second quarter survey, VZPulse+, is our signature and most robust survey of the year where we focus on employee engagement using the Gallup Q12 index."
"This survey is designed to measure sentiment on leadership, inclusion, values and empowerment."
"Confidential, aggregated results of the VZPulse+ survey are cascaded, as applicable, to leaders throughout the company and jumpstart an annual action planning process."
Leaders are expected to share their team-specific results and create a customized action plan to be implemented over the next 12 months.
Subsequent surveys measure the implementation and efficacy of the plans.
"The 2022 VZPulse+ survey achieved an employee participation rate of 89%, an all-time high for Verizon."
"Our results ranked in the 81st percentile in overall employee engagement, 87th percentile for a culture of inclusion and 73rd percentile in overall satisfaction compared to Gallups company-wide database."
"Our results indicate that, compared to other organizations, Verizons culture is more caring, providing employees with frequent recognition and regular progress discussions."
Other engagement channels.
"While surveys provide an excellent source of information, our senior leaders and Board listen to and learn from our employees during periodic town halls and leadership forums."
"In addition, our CEO and senior leaders regularly join company webcasts, including after each quarterly earnings release, to discuss developments across our business and topical societal issues and answer employee questions."
49 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Labor relations Our workforce includes a large presence of union-represented employees.
"The Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) together represent approximately 22.5% of our employees as of December 31, 2022."
"In 2022, we extended the collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees who serve customers in our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast service areas through August 1, 2026."
We believe that the successful extension of these agreements that were due to expire in August of 2023 reflects our strong working relationship with these unions.
"In addition, where applicable outside of the U."
"S., we engage with employee representative bodies such as works councils."
"We have a long history of maintaining open dialogues with national and local leaders of the CWA and IBEW, as well as works council leaders outside the U."
"S., on key business topics such as worker safety, customer service, plans to improve operational processes and our business performance and the impacts of changing technology and competition on our customers, employees and business strategy."
"We respect our employees rights to engage in concerted, protected activity."
"Informed by the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, as well as the United Nations Global Compact, we respect our employees rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with applicable law, including the right to join or not join worker organizations (labor unions)."
"When our employees elect to be union-represented, Verizon engages in constructive labor relations with the union representing its employees and participates in good-faith bargaining."
We invest in ongoing educational opportunities for our employees.
Training occurs across a variety of in-person and online platforms and through virtual and simulated environments.
"Newly hired employees launch their Verizon careers through intensive orientation sessions, on-the-job shadowing and, where applicable, technical training and skill application days."
"We help keep our workers and, ultimately, our customers safe by weaving safety components, including required courses and certification programs, into every technical training curriculum."
We encourage our employees to refresh and build up their skills on an ongoing basis.
"Verizon employees can take advantage of our Global Tuition Assistance Program , through which they receive a capped reimbursement for covered expenses to continue their education at any level."
All employees have access to our complete library filled with additional learning courses.
"We regularly instruct our local managers and supervisors to appropriately engage with employees and abide by all applicable federal, state and local laws."
"We also train them on our open door policy for employees to raise issues or concerns, as well as the appropriate processes to respect and redress such issues."
"Verizon has several avenues through which all employees, including union-represented workers, may raise concerns, including through our global ethics hotline and online web portal discussed in Business ethics ."
50 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Supply chain Verizons supply chain is the foundation of our secure network.
"Our suppliers range from the worlds largest original equipment manufacturers to smaller providers of equipment, hardware, software and various services."
"We manage our supply chain through internal processes and controls to mitigate risks, as well as through active supplier engagement."
Our management of supplier relationships also identifies opportunities to effect positive change.
Supplier diversity Building an inclusive supply chain Verizons enterprise-wide supplier diversity initiative aims to build a supply chain that is as diverse as the communities we serve.
"For Verizon, advancing a diverse supply chain is a business imperative and competitive advantage, helping us deliver complex supply chain solutions that give our customers superior services and experiences."
"We believe that accelerating diverse business development contributes to the prosperity of present and future supplier communities, fuels business growth and prioritizes economic parity."
Verizons longstanding commitment to fostering an inclusive supply chain dates back to our legacy companies and is embedded throughout our operations.
Our short-term incentive plan for management employees has included a performance measure related to supplier diversity for over 15 years.
"Verizons Center of Excellence for Supplier Diversity leads our enterprise-wide supplier diversity program, working with a network of business unit supplier champions from across the company to set internal supplier diversity targets, track our diversity spend goals and reporting obligations, implement training and education sessions for employees and suppliers and monitor progress through regular analytics and reporting."
"Our Supplier Diversity team also works closely with our Sourcing organization to confirm that suppliers from traditionally underrepresented, disadvantaged or minority groups are positioned to compete for new contracts and opportunities."
We offer supplier diversity training courses to reinforce our commitment to supplier inclusivity throughout the company.
We make our supplier diversity awareness training available to all employees and strongly encourage participation.
"Our supplier champions receive separate, dedicated training and participate in regular touchpoints to keep apprised of developments in our supplier diversity program."
"Through these training programs, we equip employees with the tools they need to help us increase our supplier diversity, collaborate effectively with diverse suppliers and identify new partnership opportunities."
"In 2022, Verizon spent $6.8 billion in goods and services with diverse Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, including businesses 51% owned, operated and controlled by people of color, women, veterans, service-disabled veterans, LGBTQ+ and people with disabilities.15 This brings our total spend to more than $54.7 billion over the past 10 years."
"Over the past 10 years, Verizon has spent nearly $55 billion with diverse suppliers."
"51 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizon is a charter member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, a coalition formed in 2001 of companies that each spend more than $1 billion every year with diverse businesses."
"Our supplier diversity framework is based on strong leadership, and we are proud to have earned numerous supplier diversity and inclusion awards."
"Capital markets Verizon continues to demonstrate leadership in promoting the growth of DEI firms, including those with Black, Hispanic, female and veteran ownership, in the debt capital markets."
"Over the past year, we have partnered with 15 DEI firms across all of our eligible unsecured debt capital markets transactions and asset-backed securities (ABS) offerings."
"These partnerships provide meaningful economics and distribution opportunities for the DEI firms, enabling them to support more and larger capital markets transactions, hire and promote people from underrepresented groups, expand the pool of qualified candidates from such groups through programs such as internships and invest in their communities, including through partnerships with nonprofit organizations."
"In 2022, Verizons gross unsecured debt capital markets fee allocation to DEI firms was 23.8%, which far exceeded our 10% target."
"A key contributor to this result was our fourth green bond issuance, where three of the four lead underwriters were DEI firms, sharing equally in the responsibilities and economics of the transaction."
"Verizon continued to advance its market-leading DEI protocols in the ABS markets as well, engaging nine DEI firms as underwriters on ABS deals in 2022, resulting in 15% of ABS underwriting fees awarded to DEI firms."
"Outside of the debt capital markets, we continue to support DEI managers in our defined benefit pension plan."
"Assets under management with DEI firms constituted approximately 7.4% of the defined benefit pension plan assets as of December 31, 2022."
Marketing ecosystem Verizons DEI initiatives extend to addressing DEI in the marketing ecosystem.
"We have published a responsible marketing policy that sets out our intention to work with publishers, agencies, technology partners and talent who advance our mission to deliver diverse and inclusive perspectives and to support content creators and platforms that do not promote hatred, bias or other forms of content that are antithetical to Verizons values."
"We also adopted a responsible marketing action plan that sets out additional actions, including efforts to guard against racism, bias and stereotypes in Verizons advertising content."
"As part of our responsible marketing action plan, we are working to increase diversity across the creative supply chain."
"We aim to spend over 40% from our productions with diverse-owned video production companies, experiential production companies and print production companies and to engage diverse directors on 40% of our productions."
"To share the learnings from our multi-year journey to address DEI both internally and in the marketing industry as a whole, we have published a responsible marketing action blueprint ."
This free online tool packages together learnings to help other marketers identify where they can make an impact and take measurable actions to get there.
Legal profession Verizon has been working for many years to promote DEI in the legal profession in collaboration with our law firm suppliers.
"In 2022, we had a goal that, of the total annual fees billed across all outside counsel firms and all Verizon matters, at least 25% should be from attorneys who are people of color, LGBTQ+ or individuals with disabilities and at least 35% from gender diverse attorneys."
"For 2023, we have increased these targets to 27% and 37%, respectively."
"To support our diversity goal, we are focused on partnering with law firms that demonstrate a commitment to hiring, developing and supporting diverse attorneys and professionals."
"We collect and regularly review partner firms diversity representation metrics, staffing across Verizon matters and other relevant information to evaluate the firms DEI efforts and work together on opportunities for enhancement as appropriate."
"52 Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizon 2022 ESG Report Additionally, Verizon collaborates with a number of our outside counsel firms on paid internship programs to foster diversity, equity and inclusion in the legal pipeline."
"As part of a 10-week summer program, select first year summer associates participate in the Leadership Council for Legal Diversitys 1L Scholars Program and then split the remainder of the program working as summer associates at our partner law firm and as interns in Verizons in-house legal department."
"While at Verizon, the interns are exposed to a variety of work assignments from different practice areas."
"The program advances the summer associates professional development by providing an early view into work as outside counsel at a major law firm and as in-house counsel at a communications and technology company, all while expanding their network of mentors and professional connections."
Supply chain management Supplier Risk Office Verizons Supplier Risk Management Program supports the companys implementation of responsible sourcing.
"Managed by a dedicated team in Verizons Supplier Risk Office, the program enables Verizon to identify, assess, monitor and manage a range of supply chain-related risks, including those that may be associated with the social and environmental impacts of supplier activity."
The Supplier Risk Office works closely with teams across the company to implement a risk management framework and make recommendations regarding future supplier engagement.
"This work happens throughout the supplier lifecycle, including during planning, due diligence, contracting, ongoing monitoring and termination."
"The Supplier Risk Office is responsible for providing program oversight, coordination and support to stakeholders throughout Verizon."
Supply chain resilience management An effective supply chain is also a resilient one.
Supply chain resilience at Verizon means that we work to provide products and services that are available as needed and prepare for any sudden or widespread supply chain disruptions.
We recently established the Supply Chain Resilience Management Office and the Supply Chain Resilience Management Program to better coordinate our supply chain activities and ensure the effectiveness of our controls.
"The Supply Chain Resilience Management Program is a centralized system that monitors how Verizon stakeholders manage the life cycle phases of our physical products, software, firmware and services."
"The program also assesses whether stakeholders need to improve their procedures to more effectively mitigate supply chain risks as they relate to four key categories: security, integrity, resilience and quality."
The program is guided by our Supply Chain Resilience Management Corporate Policy and overseen by our new cross-functional Global Supply Chain Resilience Governance Council.
Upholding standards of conduct Suppliers.
Verizon expects all of our suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code) or an equivalent set of standards.
"The Supplier Code sets forth our expectations for our suppliers and the subcontractors and agents of our suppliers, including the expectation that they not engage in any forms of illegal or inappropriate activity such as corruption, extortion, embezzlement and bribery."
Our Supplier Code includes provisions that: Forbid the use of child labor and forced labor.
"Protect employees rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, as permitted by local laws."
"Prohibit discrimination on any basis prohibited by applicable/local law, including, without limitation, race, color, religion, age, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, national origin, disability, marital status, citizenship status, veteran status or military status."
We reserve the right to review or audit our suppliers compliance with the Supplier Code.

"Our Verizon Sales Agent Standards of Conduct detail the behavior and values that we expect our sales agents to uphold and require them to implement an appropriate management process to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws, regulations and customer requirements, as well as conformance with the Standards."
We reserve the right to review or audit our sales agents compliance with the Standards.
"Promoting compliance We believe that providing supplemental compliance education helps spread awareness on the ethical decision-making processes, legal obligations and compliance risks associated with the onboarding, monitoring and offboarding processes of our business partners."
"Since 2021, Verizon has rolled out mandatory training courses on our Supplier Code and Sales Agent Standards for our key suppliers and sales agents."

"We encourage concerned parties to contact us via email or through our confidential portal and hotline, available at www.verizonethics.com ."
Driving sustainable supplier practices We are committed to working with our suppliers toward the shared goal of responsible business conduct throughout our supply chain.
"We engage our suppliers to promote social and environmental responsibility, including protection for the rights of workers, through a number of channels."
"Our engagement with suppliers is informed by the results of our recent saliency assessment, which identified rights in the workplace and supply chain as a salient area of risk and opportunity for Verizon."
See Human rights for more information on Verizons corporate-wide saliency assessment.
"EcoVadis We continued our partnership with EcoVadis throughout 2022, using the EcoVadis assessment tool to evaluate our suppliers responsible performance."
"We monitor and assess supplier performance in four areas: Environment Labor and human rights Ethics Sustainable procurement 54 Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizon 2022 ESG Report Since 2013, we have assessed 623 key suppliers through our partnership with EcoVadis."
EcoVadis validates suppliers responses to their detailed questionnaire and researches information from other public sources to benchmark suppliers on their performance.
"When weaknesses are identified, we work with the supplier to create a corrective action plan to improve their current activities."
Both Verizon and our suppliers benefit from this partnership.
"Joint Alliance for CSR Verizon is a member of the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC), an association of telecom operators that collaboratively audits common vendors and looks for opportunities to improve supplier responsibility across our industry."
This furthers our efforts to understand not only what our suppliers are pledging through their policies but also to survey on-site performance.
"JAC audits are based on a common verification, assessment and development methodology, including the generation of corrective action plans."
"Topics covered by these audits include child labor, forced labor, health and safety, freedom of association, non-discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours, wages and compensation, the environment and business ethics."
"Through 2022, 910 supplier audits had been completed since JACs inception in 2010, with 98 audits completed in 2022."
Verizon joined JAC in 2013 as the first U.
S.-based member.
"We are a participant in JACs Human Rights workstream, which focuses on human rights challenges in telecom industry supply chains."
"Mitigating value chain emissions Climate change is a serious threat that warrants meaningful action, and Verizon is committed to doing its part by collaborating with other corporations, the public sector and non-governmental organizations."
"As we work to reduce our scope 3 GHG emissions, Verizon is partnering with organizations like the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and EcoVadis."
"Through these partnerships, we are focused on engaging our suppliers to fully report their scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 (all relevant categories) emissions data and obtain independent external review and assurance of the data."
We are also encouraging our suppliers to set their own emissions reduction targets.
"Responsible procurement Verizon is dedicated to responsible sourcing practices that support human rights, ethical conduct and protection for the environment."
"We hold ourselves and our supply chain accountable for responsible sourcing practices and we collaborate with suppliers, partners and others in the industry to strengthen an d advance responsible sourcing practices around the world."
Modern slavery Verizon is committed to assessing and addressing the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking within our business operations and supply chain.
We are engaged in an ongoing assessment of the nature and extent of our exposure to the risk of modern slavery by reviewing areas of Verizons supply chain that may be at higher risk.
"Teams engaged in this review effort include our Business & Human Rights Program, Business Risk, Sourcing, Supplier Risk Office and Sustainability."
"In 2021, we enhanced our screening efforts with respect to new suppliers in order to prioritize higher risk industries for due diligence with respect to forced labor."
Our efforts are also informed by engagement with industry peers through organizations such as JAC.
"In addition, our Business Risk team is trained in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking risk and carries out reputational risk due diligence on new and existing vendors."
"Where this team identifies information that could be a risk factor , they bring that information to the Supplier Risk Office and appropriate legal teams for review."
We describe our efforts in more detail in our U.
K. Modern Slavery Act Statement and Australia Modern Slavery Act Statement .
55 Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizon 2022 ESG Report Conflict minerals Verizons conflict minerals due diligence framework was designed to align with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.
Our approach takes into account our position in the conflict minerals supply chain and the fact that Verizon does not typically contract to manufacture the products associated with our business.
More information on our approach can be found in our most recent Conflict Minerals Report .
"16 Verizons suppliers are required, as relevant, to take steps to verify that their products do not include materials that either directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (or in any adjoining country)."
"Our work on conflict minerals is led by a cross-functional team that includes representatives from ESG, Legal, Sourcing and Sustainability."
"Team members periodically review the goals for our conflict minerals compliance program, with the Legal, Sourcing and Sustainability teams taking primary responsibility for supplier-facing diligence and compliance measures."
"Our Chief Financial Officer is the signatory on our Conflict Minerals Report, whenever such filing is required."
Verizon also participates in industry initiatives and partnerships to support responsible raw material sourcing in high-risk countries and regions.
"By engaging in these initiatives, Verizon goes beyond the minimum due diligence framework recommended by the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to promote responsible mining practices in conflict-affected countries."
"Our efforts have included support for sourcing programs, which are intended to assure that the legitimate mining economy within the Congolese region is sustained and to minimize the harmful societal and economic impacts that would be caused by an inadvertent de facto embargo of conflict minerals."
"Verizon has joined the Responsible Minerals Initiative, which was jointly founded in 2008 by members of GeSI and the Responsible Business Alliance to provide a resource for companies seeking to promote responsible mineral sourcing in their supply chains."
"Verizon is also a member of the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA), a joint initiative of the U."
"S. State Department, the U."
"S. Agency for International Development, private sector companies and trade associations, civil society and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region."
The PPA works to collectively call for action to address conflict minerals concerns while delivering solutions that benefit those involved in responsible minerals trade in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes Region of Central Africa.
56 Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizon 2022 ESG Report Digital responsibility Cybersecurity There is no higher priority at Verizon than protecting the security of our systems and networks.
"To effectively address todays cybersecurity threats, Verizons Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the cybersecurity team oversee enterprise-wide information security strategy, policy, standards, architecture and engineering processes."
"Verizons comprehensive information security program includes, among other aspects: Cyber defense, including incident response and resiliency planning and testing Product and platform security Cyber architecture and engineering Identity and access management Risk assessment and management, including third-party oversight Verizons enterprise-wide Information Security Policy is aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technologys (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (Version 1.1)."
Verizon also maintains a robust cybersecurity insurance program.
"Our CISO leads a formal annual review and discussion with the full Board, dedicated to Verizons cyber risks, threats and protections, and provides updates throughout the year as warranted."
"In addition, the Audit Committee receives regular updates from senior management on the companys cybersecurity posture and related matters."
Risk assessment and vulnerability management Verizon has deployed a comprehensive Enterprise Vulnerability Management (EVM) program designed to identify and protect against data security risks through the following methods: Framework.
"Our EVM program is governed by a comprehensive policy that outlines the core components, cadence and personnel responsibilities necessary to sustain a healthy and well-balanced program."
Risk identification.
"We continually assess the threat and vulnerability landscape using various commercial, government, vendor and publicly available information sources."
Risk detection.
We use both manual and automated detection methods on a scheduled and real-time basis to identify vulnerabilities within our network infrastructure.
Risk evaluation.
Identified vulnerabilities are assigned a severity classification based on their evaluated risk using an industry-standard scoring model.
Remediation.
Vulnerabilities are reported to the appropriate asset owners and custodians for remediation.
"If remediation is not feasible within the policy timeframe, a work plan is developed and tracked."
"In rare circumstances, an exception may be approved, which is tracked in a central system of record as mitigating or compensating controls are considered and deployed."
Metrics and reporting.
We collect and retain data for reporting purposes and to enhance management accountability for remediation of vulnerable assets.
We also use the data to assess threat trends and for strategic planning of ongoing program improvements.
57 Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizon 2022 ESG Report External audits and assessments We enlist outside experts to conduct audits and assessments to validate our EVM program.
"Annually, we are assessed by an external Qualified Security Assessor across the broad PCI data security standard requirements."
Our Global Network Management Cybersecurity Center is ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 27001:2013 certified and is subject to yearly audits by a third-party assessor.
"Every two years, we engage in an enterprise-wide NIST Cybersecurity Framework maturity assessment conducted by an independent third-party assessor, the results of which are presented to our Board of Directors."
"Empowering our employees Our people are an important line of defense, so we invest heavily in training our employees to protect our systems and networks against attackers."
Every Verizon employee receives annual information security training.
"We also rely on phishing simulations, which are sent to all of our employees."
Employees who fail to recognize these emails are provided with additional phishing awareness training so that Verizon can be better prepared when targeted by real phishing attacks.
"We run an ongoing cyber health program throughout the year to reinforce security best practices through articles, learning curricula and videos."
"To further executive awareness of current industry threats, we are rolling out additional cybersecurity training fo r top Verizon leaders."
Third-party risk management and oversight Verizon partners with suppliers to deliver our products and services to our customers.
"To maintain the health of these business relationships, Verizon executes an enterprise-wide Supplier Risk Management Program."
Information security is one key subject area addressed as part of this larger program and requires suppliers who access sensitive business or customer information to meet or exceed security requirements based on Verizons corporate information security policies and industry best practices.
"Supplier risk management is an ongoing process, which begins by performing due diligence actions before a contract is signed and continues throughout the duration of the supplier relationship to provide effective oversight."
"For more information on risk management and oversight, see Supply chain management ."
"Enhancing 5G cybersecurity We recognize that potential cybersecurity risks will continue, or arise anew, as adoption of 5G expands."
Our approach to addressing these concerns is guided by security principles that have underpinned our previous networks and that we can use with greater efficiency and effect in 5G.
"We are designing and deploying our 5G network with security as a central element, relying exclusively on trusted vendors that have undergone rigorous supply chain vetting processes."
"We routinely assess the software and hardware that goes into our network and employ rigorous, documented policies and procedures for secure configuration and operation of equipment and devices."
"Components of our 5G infrastructure, even within the network itself, are required to authenticate to one another prior to performing their functions."
"Further, we leverage the new 5G architecture and technical standards, which we ourselves have helped develop, to provide new security features that did not exist in previous generations of wireless technology."
"Finally, we have helped spearhead global advances in the security of the Internet of Things (IoT) and other devices that connect to the 5G network and will continue to advance new security innovations in the future."
"Read our white paper on how our 5G network is designed, deployed and operated with security at its core."
"58 Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizon 2022 ESG Report Data security and business continuity Verizon understands the importance of responsibly handling data security incidents that impact our customers, employees and business."
"When we become aware of a potential data security incident, we deploy trained teams to investigate and address the incident as swiftly as possible."
"We also promptly notify relevant authorities and impacted individuals as warranted based on applicable laws, regulations, industry standards and other factors."
"We notify impacted individuals through various communication channels, including phone, email, text message and postal mail."
Verizon also provides technical support to customers seeking guidance on protecting their Verizon and other online accounts.
"Verizons perspective on data security is based in part by our annual Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), a comprehensive study of data security incidents from around the world."
"In 2022, the DBIR analyzed over 23,000 cybersecurity incidents."
This actionable intelligence helps companies large and small better understand the threat environment and plays an important role in shaping Verizons own cybersecurity efforts.
"While data security is a key area of focus, Verizons business continuity and crisis management planning extends much further."
"We embrace an all-hazards approach that mandates planning for a wide range of potential adverse events, whether they be natural or human-induced."
"This planning encompasses all four phases of emergency managementpreparedness, response, recovery and mitigation."
"To put our planning to the test, Verizon conducts exercises and drills no less than annually in a number of key planning areas and requires exercise participants to produce after-action reports that highlight the lessons learned."
These learnings are carefully studied and incorporated into future planning.
"For more information, see Business continuity and event management ."
"As a global company, Verizon aligns its internal business continuity program with several domestic and international industry standards, including, but not limited to, ISO 22301:2012 and ISO 22320:2011(E), FEMA NIMS and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38."
Data protection and privacy Data protection and privacy are strategic priorities for Verizon.
"We recognize that protecting the privacy of customer, employee and business partner data is an essential part of operating and growing our business."
"Our company is also impacted by current and emerging federal, state and international laws related to data protection and privacy."
We have established measures to protect the privacy and security of the data entrusted to us and to help ensure compliance with data protection and privacy legislation.
"Our work in this area is conducted under the oversight of our Chief Privacy Officer, who reviews data privacy risks and mitigating actions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors at least annually."
"Verizon has adopted corporate policies and operating procedures governing the data we collect and how we use, retain and protect it."
Detailed information about Verizons privacy policies and practices can be found on the Privacy Policy page on our corporate website.
This page contains links to supplemental policies for some of our apps and services and separate privacy policies maintained by our affiliated companies.
"We update our privacy policies to reflect developments in products, services and technologies."
We will not use personal information in a manner that is materially different from the terms of the privacy policy that was in place at the time that information was collected without providing notice and obtaining consent.
"Verizon continuously monitors for new and amended international, federal, state and local laws, as well as relevant interpretations of existing laws and self-regulatory programs, and we update our policies and processes as needed."
We continue to advocate for a uniform federal privacy framework to apply to all participants in the technology ecosystem to enable clear and consistent rules of the road.
Our policies and procedures are subject to numerous controls.
"We use internal audits and conduct employee, contractor and vendor training to promote ongoing compliance."
"In addition, Verizon has implemented a privacy governance framework that maps privacy requirements to specific operational controls and then assigns those controls to appropriate owners."
"As part of 59 Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizon 2022 ESG Report the framework, Verizon tests and monitors the controls and develops remediation plans where necessary."
"Finally, key employees include in their performance agreements terms related to their ownership of controls."
"Our stewardship of personal data We have an obligation to handle the personal information we collect from and about our customers, employees and business partners appropriately throughout every phase of the data life cycle, including collection, use, disclosure, retention and destruction."
We disclose our practices and have in place policies related to each phase.
"We conduct privacy reviews when we develop and modify products, systems or other initiatives, offshore work through our global clearance process and purchase or sell assets."
Our privacy impact assessment process discussed below provides a platform for formalized review of initiatives that involve the personal information entrusted to us.
We have also implemented a third-party risk management process that focuses on our highest-risk suppliers.
Collection and use.
"We collect and use information as we describe in our publicly available privacy policies and in some cases, for business customers, in accordance with contractual requirements."
"We seek to minimize the amount of personal information that we collect and retain, and we provide customers several different ways to review and keep their account information up to date."
"Our practices are designed to protect and respect privacy, including providing customers with easy-to-understand privacy choices based on the sensitivity of the personal information and how it will be used or disclosed."
Disclosure.
We share personal information within Verizon and with vendors and partners for a variety of purposes as described in our privacy policies.
We require vendors that process personal information on behalf of Verizon to use it only for the purpose for which it was provided and to put in place data protection and security measures that provide the same material protections as those we use at Verizon.
We enforce these requirements through binding contractual provisions that must be approved before personal information is shared.
Data retention and destruction.
We maintain corporate policies governing data retention and review data retention practices as part of our privacy impact assessment process.
"Under our practices and policies, we retain personally identifiable records only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes."
"We have policies in place to govern data destruction, including guidance related to media sanitization and disposal."

"As a leading provider of internet access services and cloud storage, we understand that the same tools that empower our customers to communicate with family and friends and safeguard their digital memories can also be misused to disseminate child sexual abuse material."
Verizons work to combat online child sexual abuse and exploitation begins with close partnerships with two organizations on the frontlines of the fight: the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and the Technology Coalition.
Verizon is a Protector-level sponsor of NCMEC.
"We participate on the Board of Directors of the Technology Coalition, the leading industry working group fighting online child exploitation."
"Through our work with the coalition, Verizon has helped enable Project Protect, an ambitious and multifaceted plan to eradicate online child sexual exploitation and abuse."
"In addition to our strong partnerships, we have implemented measures to protect our platforms from child predators, including: We scan images and videos uploaded to Verizon Cloud with PhotoDNA and CSAI Match, technology which enables us to match uploaded media against databases of known child sexual abuse material."
Human reviewers evaluate the material flagged by our scanning technology and take action on user reports of child sexual abuse material.
"All confirmed child sexual abuse material is reported to NCMEC, which acts as a clearinghouse for law enforcement."
Robocalls A robocall is an automatically generated and/or prerecorded phone call that is often spam.
"While the problem ultimately needs to be addressed by stopping illegal robocalls at the source and implementing technology to prevent bad actors from disguising their identities, we provide our customers with ways to directly protect themselves from robocalls."
"Learn more about call authentication technology, what Verizon is doing to protect customers (including providing tools such as Call Filter and Spam Alerts) and how to identify scam robocalls here ."

"63 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Digital inclusion While Verizon builds the networks that move the world forward, we recognize that far too many people face challenges connecting to those networks."
"For some, broadband is not available in the communities where they live."
"For others, cost and non-cost barriers stand in the way of internet access."
We aspire to create a digitally inclusive society that connects more people to our networks and equips our communities with tools to navigate an increasingly digital world.
Our digital inclusion efforts are focused in four key areas: Access.
Providing access to connectivity with sufficient speeds to communities in remote and underserved areas.
Affordability.
Making available devices and connectivity that offer quality service without significant cost or resource restrictions.
Adoption.
Leveraging connectivity to provide meaningful services and fostering the skills necessary to use those services.
Advocacy.
Urging policymakers to create long-lasting solutions to address the digital divide.
Access Verizons consumer business provides wireline communications services and broadband in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.
"S., as well as Washington, D."
"C. We also provide wireless communications services, broadband and fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband over our extensive, nationwide wireless network."
We are focused on expanding digital access to a greater number of households in rural areas of the U.
S.
"The challenges of deploying home broadband in rural areas, such as rough terrain and low-density population levels, have created barriers to some private investment, leaving too many people without reliable internet service."
"The Investment in Infrastructure and Jobs Act, passed by the U."
"S. Congress in late 2021, includes a historic investment of $65 billion to address these challenges and help states close the digital divide."
States and localities may also use American Rescue Plan funds to help build out broadband.
Verizon is reviewing available state and local subsidy programs and actively applying for funds to help bring our services to more locations where it makes sense for our network.
"We recognize that there is much more work to be done to bring better broadband internet access to rural communities, and we are excited about how Verizon can help."
Our 4G LTE and 5G wireless services also help address the broadband connectivity needs of underserved communities.
"Over a decade ago, we launched our LTE in Rural America program to accelerate the rollout and adoption of 4G LTE services in rural areas."
"As part of this initiative, we provided support to help rural wireless carriers build out and operate their own LTE networks and, through reciprocal roaming arrangements, extend the footprint of LTE coverage for both the rural carriers and Verizon Wireless customers."
"As of December 31, 2022, our 4G LTE network covers approximately 328 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners."
We continue to invest in our wireless network in rural U.
"S. markets, building new cell sites to provide additional coverage and expanding capacity on our existing cell sites to improve the performance of the network and our customers experience."

"We launched 5G commercial service on C-Band spectrum in January 2022, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million points of service in the U."
"S. as of December 31, 2022."
Our strong C-Band spectrum position is the result of multi-year strategic planning and investment.
We expect to continue deploying the spectrum across the continental U.
S. as it becomes more available for our use.
"With the expansion of our 5G footprint, Verizon is making high performing internet more accessible to consumers across the country."
64 Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix Verizon 2022 ESG Report We offer FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE wireless networks.
FWA broadband can provide more robust and affordable internet access than may otherwise be available to consumers in certain markets.
FWA enables fixed broadband access using radio frequencies instead of cables and can be used to connect homes and businesses to the internet.
"As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1.5 million FWA broadband connections."
"Verizon LTE Home, available in parts of all 50 states, offers unlimited broadband access with download speeds of at least 25 Mbps and up to 50 Mbps."
"With our 5G Home Internet offering, Verizon has made high performing home internet more affordable for new and existing customers, with pricing plans starting at $25 per month, no data caps or equipment fees and no annual contract requirement."

The ACP provides eligible low-income consumers with a discount of up to $30 per month (or up to $75 per month for households on Tribal lands) on our home and mobile internet plans.
"Our latest Verizon Forward Program supplements our ACP offering by providing new and existing ACP-qualified customers with free high-speed internet access with no data caps, no equipment charges and no additional taxes and fees."
"Verizon Forward expands upon its predecessor, Fios Forward, by offering free access to our LTE and 5G Home Internet plans in addition to Fios."
"Digital inclusion is not just nice to have, but anecessity."
"It is criticalthat we offer accessible, affordable and usable digitalsolutions."
Income should not be a barrier to reliable connectivity.
"Hans Vestberg, Chairman and CEO Verizon also offers consumers a wide range of affordable, prepaid wireless services with 5G access and low-cost device choices through a portfolio of brands, including TracFone, Straight Talk, Visible and Total by Verizon."
Consumers who qualify and are participating in the ACP can leverage their benefits to find zero-cost prepaid service plans.
"In 2020, recognizing the urgency for school districts to quickly and seamlessly secure connectivity for students to participate in remote learning, Verizon launched a new, national distance learning program that provided connectivity solutions at significantly discounted rates."
"Through Verizon Distance Learning, we partnered with independent school districts and state Departments of Education to deliver 4G LTE wireless connectivity, devices and other solutions to students nationwide."
"The program provides K-12 public institutions with reliable connectivity, devices, mobile device management and other security/compliance apps that school districts rely on to support distance learning."
We introduced Verizons Digital Inclusion program in 2021.
"This digital access initiative provides connectivity for mobile hotspots, smart phones, laptops and other selected equipment available to eligible users through state agencies, political subdivisions and nonprofit organizations at discounted rates."
"Eligible users include those who participate 65 Verizon 2022 ESG Report Approach Governance Environmental Social Appendix in the National School Lunch Program, Pell Grant recipients or members of households (as defined by federal tax guidelines) with a household income that is lower than 135% of the income designated by the Federal Poverty Guidelines."
"Under the Digital Inclusion program, Verizon has expanded existing partnerships with the Georgia Department of Education, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Los Angeles Unified School District to provide wireless broadband data and voice services to underserved communities in 24 states and Washington, D."

(TracFone)."
The metrics reported for 2021 exclude TracFone results.
"Total energy consumed is calculated based on emissions sources included in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, namely natural gas, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, propane, kerosene, compressed natural gas, B02, B05, B11, B20, E85, methanol, ethanol, electricity, steam and chilled water."
Percentage grid electricity is calculated as total electricity consumed as purchased from the grid (and reported for scope 2 GHG emissions) divided by total energy consumed.
Percentage renewable electricity is calculated as total renewable electricity generated on-site or purchased in the form of energy attribute certificates divided by total energy consumed.
"For more information, see our Emissions reporting webpage."
Verizon has set an operational net zero goal and interim targets to reduce the carbon footprint of our operations: We expect to achieve net zero operational emissions by 2035.
We expect to source renewable energy equivalent to 100% of our total annual electricity consumption by 2030.
We expect to achieve a 53% reduction in our scope 1 and 2 operational emissions by 2030 over a 2019 baseline to limit global warming to a 1.5C (approved by the SBTi).
"Because most of our operational carbon footprint comes from the electricity we use to power our networks, our path to operational net zero is focused on two key drivers: maximizing the energy efficiency of our networks and facilities and transitioning to renewable energy."
We are entering into long-term virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for solar and wind power under development that will bring additional renewable energy to our local electrical grids.
We generally do not expect to take physical delivery of the energy from a facility under a VPPA.
"Rather the facility operator sells the energy into the wholesale market, and we receive the renewable energy credits (RECs) associated with the energy sold."
We intend to retire these RECs against our actual energy consumption to track our progress in meeting our goals.
"As of February 10, 2023, Verizon has in place 26 long-term VPPAs for a total of approximately 3.3 gigawatts (GW) of anticipated renewable energy capacity."
"As of such date, seven projects are in commercial operation."
"We have contracted for approximately 0.8 GW of the generating capacity of these projects, which represents nearly 25% of the anticipated aggregate capacity of our VPPA portfolio."
The remaining projects are under development.
We believe that the VPPAs that we have signed position us to exceed our 2025 renewable energy target.
We will continue to identify new projects under development as we work toward our 2030 renewable energy target and 2035 operational net zero goal.

Verizon also maintains a robust cybersecurity insurance program.
We enlist outside experts to conduct audits and assessments to validate our Enterprise Vulnerability Management program.
"Annually, we are assessed by an external Qualified Security Assessor across the broad PCI data security standard requirements."
Our Global Network Management Cybersecurity Center is ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 27001:2013 certified and is subject to yearly audits by a third-party assessor.

TC-TL-550a.2 Discussion of systems to provide unimpeded service during service interruptions Verizon is an industry leader in operating resilient and reliable networks that support the needs of our customers.
Our networks in the U.
"S. include various design elements, technologies and business processes that work together to enhance the reliability of our services."
Designed with dual path and equipment redundancy.
Verizons network design includes redundancy on critical paths and for critical network components to mitigate the impact of network events on customers.
We use forward-looking risk assessments to plan and maintain our fiber backhaul configuration for critical network sites.
"Such sites may contain traffic aggregation points, data centers or other technical facilities and typically have fiber backhaul deployed in a resilient ring or hub configuration, as well as dual diverse entrance facilities supporting our core infrastructure."
"Verizon has also implemented a meshed core network architecture, which enables network equipment to switch traffic almost instantly across multiple available transmission paths between two endpoints."
"When available, this enables the network to self-recover promptly from outages to physical facilities (e.g., a fiber cut)."
Use of battery and generator technology.
"To minimize the impact of power disruptions at critical sites, we deploy reserve power in the form of batteries and/or generators."
Our switching facilities are equipped with battery backup power and generators.
"Macro sites have battery backup power as well, and the majority are equipped with generators."
"In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed as needed."
Reliability-focused business processes.
"To minimize the likelihood of congestion on our networks, Verizon proactively manages and augments network capacity based on defined thresholds associated with the expected voice, video, application and data traffic patterns across our network."
"To help ensure appropriate network diversity and redundancy, we perform several internal audits per year."
Our engineering standards for strategic directional platforms require high availability equipment with auto-failover capabilities to protect critical services.
"Requirements for diversity and redundancy for critical paths and network sites are reviewed and addressed as part of network planning, engineering and operations activity."
Overlapping spectrum and coverage areas .
Verizon designs its wireless network to provide for overlapping spectrum and coverage areas in many cases.
"If a particular cell site goes offline, devices may switch to a different site and maintain connectivity."
Different spectrum bands deployed on our 4G and 5G networks can provide customers with additional options for connectivity and capacity if certain bands or nodes experience an increase in usage.
Most customer devices have the option to move seamlessly between our 4G and 5G networks and available Wi-Fi networks to provide our customers with a high degree of reliability.
"For more information on how we manage business continuity risk and the measures we have undertaken to make our networks more resilient, see our TCFD Report and Network reliability and resilience ."
