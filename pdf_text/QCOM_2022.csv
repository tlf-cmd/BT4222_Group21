S. forests sequestering carbon10.
"C-V2X applications can improve safety and travel mode options for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and pedal cyclists in underserved communities who are disproportionately impacted by fatalities in both urban and rural areas."
Cyclist fatality rates are 23 percent higher for Latinos and 30 percent higher for African Americans11.
"Low-income, Black and Latino communities also have higher vehicular traffic volumes, trucking routes, major arterial roads, intersections that are unsafe or impassable by foot or bike and an overall lower level and quality of walking and cycling infrastructure12."
"In addition to preventing collisions for enhanced safety, information exchanged between road users and infrastructure can also inform mobility-on-demand to increase transportation equity in these communities."
"In rural areas, the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled is 2 times higher than in urban areas13; and the lack of connectivity to support emergency response could be a major cause of rural deaths."
Complementary network coverage on rural roads is key to addressing these challenges.
Vehicles equipped with connectivity can communicate with their surroundings to enhance safety for road users.
"Connected vehicles communicate safety information to reduce road incidents and potentially save lives a notable example involves providing emergency vehicles the ability to pre-empt traffic signals as they approach, turning them green while also alerting surrounding vehicles of their approach, providing them with advanced notice to safely move out of the way."

"For our external stakeholders, we understand our obligations to maintain compliance with applicable legal and other requirements by incorporating industry best practices to meet expected health and safety criteria and to minimize adverse health and safety impacts that could be present in our operations and activities."
"Our environment, health and safety management system, or EHS Code of Practice, builds on the foundation of The Qualcomm Way: Our Code of Business Conduct and our Environment, Health and Safety Policy ."
Our EHS Code of Practice comprises a series of globally applicable business practices and assurance processes associated with our operations and activities.
"It provides the framework for consistent methods of managing occupational health and safety, protecting the environment, supporting community health and safety, ensuring compliance with internal and external requirements and driving continuous improvements."
The EHS management system is structured using the ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 frameworks.
Our three manufacturing facilities are formally certified by the internationally recognized ISO 45001 standard on occupational health and safety management and ISO 14001 standard for environmental management.
Compliance with these international standards is regularly audited and verified by external auditors annually.
"Using our EHS Code of Practice and continuous improvement principles, we look for ways to learn from our experiences as well as industry best practices and share those lessons among our stakeholders to improve safety performance and safety practices."
"One way we share lessons learned is through our incident management reporting system, a centralized global tool that is accessible to all employees."
"We strongly encourage reporting incidents and near-misses, no matter how minor they may seem."
We currently have an annual global target for Lost Time Incident Rate (L TIR) of less than 0.50 and a T otal Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) target of less than 0.60.
We target zero fatalities.
We publish our performance on these indicators annually in the ESG Performance Summary .

We have continuously heard from our employees that work flexibility is the way of the future for our Company.
"We intend to honor that sentiment while also ensuring that, as a Company built on innovation, we preserve our unique culture of collaboration and innovation."
We are embracing the experimental aspects of our hybrid model.
"We ensure that we are listening to our employees by asking specific questions related to the hybrid work model in our company-wide pulse surveys, as well as through employee focus groups and town halls, while also assessing overall productivity."
We will continue to consider our business needs and listen to employees in order to evolve and adjust the model when and if needed.
Contractor Safety The importance of workplace safety and protecting the environment applies equally to our contractors.
Our contractors are expected to stop work when they see an unsafe condition and adhere to all applicable safety requirements.
"The key safety standard that drives contractor performance is the Contractor Safety Management standard, which sets expectations for contractor prequalification and contract administration and management, as well as contractor monitoring."
Contractors who perform potentially hazardous work must have established contractor safety protocols and procedures that verify qualifications and outline required training for all contractors before beginning work.
This includes site- and task- specific safety training that must be completed prior to commencement of the contract.

We want our products to be distinguished not only by their capabilities but also by the responsible way in which we design and produce them.
"Because we primarily utilize a fabless production model, we rely on suppliers to perform the manufacturing of our integrated circuits."
We work closely with the primary semiconductor foundries and assembly suppliers that manufacture our products to regularly assess risks and monitor for supplier code of conduct conformance.
"We expect our suppliers to uphold the same corporate responsibility standards as ours, including respect for human rights, responsible sourcing of minerals, reducing emissions and minimizing use of resources such as water and energy."
"As a Full Member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), we require suppliers to adopt either the RBA Code of Conduct or a similar code."
"By leveraging RBA tools and resources in our supply chain management program, we can focus on driving our suppliers to conform to high standards in relation to labor issues, health and safety, the environment, ethics and management systems."
"The RBA Code of Conduct, which serves as our Supplier Code of Conduct , and The Qualcomm Way: Our Code of Business Conduct have been cornerstones of our commitment to the RBA and responsible supply chain management for many years."
Understanding risks and ensuring supply chain sustainability is a key part of acting responsibly.
"As part of our risk-based approach, we require our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers to complete the RBA Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) annually."
"The SAQ is a risk-assessment tool that enables companies to evaluate specific supply chain risk in areas such as labor, health and safety, environment and ethics."
The SAQ results from our suppliers have indicated that 100 percent of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers have all low-risk manufacturing facilities.
"Regularly assessing and monitoring suppliers for compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct allows us to minimize potential harm to individuals, communities and the environment, as well as create more resilient supply chains."
"In addition to completing the SAQ, our suppliers are subject to RBA Validated Assessment Program (VAP) audits and/or customer managed audits."
"Our supply chain management team maintains RBA Lead Auditor trained personnel who conduct on-site audits of selected suppliers for their adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct and other corporate responsibility requirements, including product environmental governance and conflict minerals."
"For more on our audit program, see Human Rights ."
We have a 2025 goal of ensuring 100 percent of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers are audited at least every two years.
"As of 2022, 88 percent of them are receiving biennial audits."
"Environmental Management in the Supply Chain Each of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers is required to have an ISO14001-certified environmental management system, and all report meeting this requirement as of 2022."
We work with these suppliers at multiple stages of design and manufacturing to help enable their conformance to applicable environmental laws and various environmental initiatives.
"On an annual basis, we assess current and future water risks at the global and local levels using the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct tool."
"The combination of the use of this tool with internal company knowledge and guidance from external consultants has helped us to better understand physical water risks in our operations, including our supply chain."
Many of our direct semiconductor suppliers provide us with information about their GHG emissions and water use.
We use this information to help us set benchmarks for potential future corporate responsibility strategies.
"Many of these suppliers also have clear goals for reducing their water consumption and GHG emissions, and we work with them to help achieve their goals."
"35 2022 Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report Acting ResponsiblyOur semiconductor manufacturing suppliers have shown effectiveness in many areas of corporate responsibility, especially in product environmental governance."
"T o ensure their continued effectiveness, weve designed corrective action processes, including the potential removal of deficient suppliers from our supply chain."
"We believe helping our suppliers build greater knowledge of corporate responsibility issues, such as human rights, responsible minerals sourcing and selecting less harmful substances for manufacturing, can create and improve corporate responsibility throughout our supply chains."
"We share our knowledge through on-site visits, business meetings, written communication and other efforts."
"Respect for Human Rights We are committed to promoting and respecting all internationally recognized human rights and avoiding complicity in any human rights abuse throughout our Company, our operations and our business relationships, including our subsidiaries, partners, customers and supply chain."
"Our efforts are informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the eight Core Labor Standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Principles and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights."

Our approach is explained in further detail in our Human Rights Statement .
"We require all employees to complete training and certification on The Qualcomm Way: Our Code of Business Conduct, including the subsection on human rights."
"As part of our human rights due diligence efforts, we regularly conduct formal, third-party human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) of our operations as a whole or at the market level."
"These assess potential risks across our operations and/or value chain, including risks related to employees, manufacturing facilities, supply chain and communities."
HRIAs help us identify our salient human rights issues those human rights at potential risk of negative impact due to our Company activities or business relationships.
"Because we primarily rely on third parties to perform the manufacturing, assembly and most of the testing of our semiconductor products, we do not generally encounter issues with child labor, forced labor or human trafficking in our direct operations."
Indirect salient human rights risks exist primarily in our supply chains and with local community members.
"Although we may not have direct control over or causal relationships with these risks, we are committed to raising awareness of our expectations and working toward mitigating any potential link or contribution to these risks."
"Due to our reliance on suppliers, our Company has taken specific steps to prevent human rights abuses in our supply chain through our engagement with the RBA."
"Our efforts to prevent, mitigate and remediate our human rights risks and impacts in our supply chain include annual assessments of suppliers operations in accordance with the RBA SAQ, engagement with suppliers to ensure conformance to our expectations, risk-based onsite audits and participation in multi- stakeholder initiatives."
"As previously discussed, we require our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers to complete the RBA SAQ, which includes human rights risks, such as working hours, child labor, freedom of association and more."
"All our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers comply with this requirement, and all have low-risk manufacturing facilities according to the SAQ ratings."
"In addition, we encourage our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers to complete an RBA Validated Assessment Process (VAP) audit."
"During VAP audits, certified third-party auditors conduct record reviews, manager interviews and worker interviews for conformance to all standards of the RBA Code of Conduct covering labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems."
"For more information on the VAP , please see the RBA VAP guidance documents ."

"Our corporate compliance program (Program) including policies, procedures, controls, risk assessments and training is evaluated for efficacy by our Internal Audit function regularly."
We also commission a third-party expert program assessment every three years to ensure the program is maturing in line with the risks of our business.
We use the findings and recommendations from these program assessments to stay apprised of best practices and pursue continuous program improvement.
"In 2022, our Program was audited by Internal Audit and was also assessed by Ernst and Young as to the maturity of the Program and alignment with the U."
S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission guidance released in November 2020.
These reviews confirmed the Program and compliance controls are operating effectively and in alignment with regulator guidance.
Ethical conduct and decision-making are expectations of all employees and core elements of our performance assessment framework for leaders.
T eam managers and senior leaders are encouraged to create an environment where employees can feel free to raise ethical questions or concerns.
"They are also reminded to have purposeful conversations with their organizations around the importance of ethical conduct and decision-making, as we believe this is the key to trustful relationships with our key stakeholders, as well as the long-term success of the Company."
"T raining, education and employee outreach are essential to reinforce an ethical culture."
"In addition to mandatory Program and ethics training during the onboarding process for employees and temporary workers, we require the completion of a policy training and certification process every 12-24 months covering our CoBC, FCPA and Anti-Corruption policies and Program."
These training requirements are mandatory for all our regular and temporary employees.
"In 2022, we issued company-wide mandatory training on our revised and streamlined Global FCPA and Anti-Corruption Policy to help employees recognize and understand potential FCPA and anti-corruption compliance risks and the policies and procedures that are in place to ensure compliance and protect both the Company and our employees."
Ensuring that we adhere to these policies is critical to maintaining our long-standing reputation for conducting business with the utmost integrity.
"Beyond mandatory company-wide training, employees who have externally facing roles are required to complete instructor-led Anti-Corruption and Compliance training on an annual basis."

"Other than for our RF front-end modules and RF filter products, our QCT semiconductor business utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made."
"Because we are primarily fabless, our Scope 2 emissions are more significant than our Scope 1 emissions."
"Thus, our GHG goals represent a company-wide absolute target related to both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions."
"We believe that climate change is a serious environmental, social and economic threat that calls for immediate and concerted action among all sectors of society."
"Thats we expanded our commitment to reducing our operational GHG emissions to our value chain and ensured our new targets were aligned to the latest climate science by committing to and joining the Science-Based T argets Initiative: T o reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from 2020 base year T o reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 from 2020 base year T o reach net-zero global operational GHG emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040 We also maintain our 2025 GHG reduction goal, consistent with science-based reductions required to keep global warming well below 2C, to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 30% compared to a 2014 base year."
Balancing these ambitions while also growing a global Company demands forward thinking.
"Our three-part emissions mitigation strategy to meet these targets includes transitioning to renewable energy in top operational footprint regions via long term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), decarbonizing our operations through the replacement of high global warming potential gases in our manufacturing processes and transitioning our cogeneration plants at our San Diego, California headquarters to back-up power, and a minimal amount of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and carbon offsets for residual emissions."

One of the ways we are achieving our GHG reduction is by designing energy efficiencies into our facilities infrastructure.
"As part of these efforts, we have successfully completed the test phase of a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) chamber cleans project."
"The project, conducted at our German manufacturing facility, replaces high global warming potential gases used in our processes, such as SF6 and NF3, with a Fluorine-based gas mixture that has a global warming potential of zero, thereby greatly reducing our direct Scope 1 emissions."
"In 2021, we signed a 10-year structured renewable energy agreement with Shell Energy North America (US), L."
P .
(Shell Energy).
"The deal enables us to secure approximately 115,000 megawatt-hours of 100% renewable energy annually to power our headquarters campus in San Diego, reducing our Scope 2 emissions."
The agreement includes an annually increasing portion of renewable power and RECs generated from resources located in California.
"It also supports the further development of the Shell Maverick 4 and Maverick 7 solar installations, which will improve the mix of green energy sources flowing into the California Independent System Operator (ISO) grid."
"Additionally, our manufacturing facilities in China, Germany and Singapore have been International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 (Environmental Management System Standard) certified since 1999 and ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety standard) certified since January 2021."
"Our facility in Germany has obtained ISO 50001 (Energy Management System standard) certification since 2014, and we plan to expand this certification to our Singapore and China facilities by 2023."
Qualcomms strategy for complying with regulatory carbon trading systems in both California and the EU is to follow all applicable guidance and directives issued by the California and EU systems.
"Qualcomm has also proactively collaborated with regulators to ensure compliance; for example, by determining which of our California operations are subject to Cap and T rade (Ca T) regulations, in consultation with regulators, and which are exempt."
We continue to deploy activities and invest in programs that support our advancement in the reduction of our emissions.
"We intend to continue to opt, where possible, for the generation of clean energy and the deployment of new technologies to reduce our environmental impact, among other measures."
We are committed to acting and making a positive contribution in the fight against climate change.

"We integrate environment, health and safety (EHS) principles and practices into our everyday operations, ensuring a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, visitors and communities."
Our EHS Policy highlights our commitment to proactively manage workplace health and safety risks while continually improving our established management system.
"We maintain compliance with applicable legal and other requirements, regularly monitor and improve EHS performance, mitigate hazards and risks and incorporate industry best practices."
The EHS Policy also provides a framework for setting and reviewing EHS objectives.
"Our EHS governance framework and global EHS management system, which are overseen at the highest levels of the Company, enable us to effectively manage risk, ensure regulatory compliance and address the health and safety needs of our employees and contractors."
"Starting with our EHS Policy as the foundation, our EHS management system (code of practice) comprises of a series of globally applicable Core Principles, Standards and assurance processes that are structured using the ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 frameworks as a foundation."
The EHS Code of Practice serves as a guide for developing a broad range of programs for the protection of workers and the environment into our day-to-day business management systems.
It provides the framework to establish an overall strategy and an organizational structure for managing Qualcomm EHS program.
"Qualcomm requires all its worldwide offices, labs and manufacturing facilities to apply the EHS Code of Practice to avoid, mitigate and manage health and safety risks."
"The EHS Code of Practice is periodically reviewed and updated to maintain alignment with industry best practice and applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and ensure continuous improvement."
Qualcomm sites are required to conduct self-assessments as part of our annual compliance assurance process.
Lab management and local EHS engineers conduct more frequent spot checks and inspections to assess compliance.
"In addition, we require regular internal EHS audits to verify the effective implementation of our EHS programs, as well as periodic external audits to verify the compliance status of country-specific regulatory requirements."
"Particularly for our manufacturing facilities, which demand the usage of hazardous substances to produce wafers, we conduct risk assessments for all workplaces and production sites to attempt to mitigate risks from these substances and to control other risks from our manufacturing activities."
Any applicable threshold of dangerous substances is regularly monitored.
This applies to workstations of our employees as well as emissions to our environment.
"In addition, we are continuously checking possibilities and options for substitution of hazardous substances with materials of lower risk characteristics."
"Regardless, any new substances undergo extensive review and approval processes before application can begin."

"In 2020, we conducted our first company-wide climate scenario analysis (CSA)."
"Our qualitative evaluation included 1.5C, 2C and 4C warming scenarios."
"Under the 4C scenario, global warming reaches 4C by 2100, relative to pre-industrial temperatures, and climate policy is less ambitious."
"In the 2C scenario, global warming reaches 2C above pre-industrial levels, and climate policy is more aggressive compared to the 4C policy."
"In the 1.5C scenario, global warming will be limited to rising well below 2C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, and it is generally assumed that society will act rapidly to limit GHG emissions."
"We assessed a limited set of risks: price of carbon (transition risk), coastal flooding, high heat days, water stress, extreme cold days, average temperature and air pollution (physical risks)."
"As we evaluated the possible impacts to our Company under these three scenarios, we focused on the potential for increased operating costs and increased business interruption across our operations."
"We leveraged standardized, third-party climate modeling data, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and applied internal data sources such as our global GHG emissions, water use and facilities data."
"Potential Impacts: Water stress in India, China, Germany, Singapore and the United States, where high-value operations are located, may pose an escalating risk of business interruption and increased operating costs, regardless of the future climate warming scenario."
"An increased number of high heat days in the United States, Singapore and India may pose an escalating risk of business interruption and increased operating costs in both 4C and 2C CSAs but is expected to occur earlier and be greater in magnitude in the 4C CSA."
An increase in average temperatures in the United States and Germany may pose an escalating risk of business interruption and increased operating costs in both 4C and 2C CSAs but is expected to occur earlier and be greater in magnitude in the 4C CSA.
"Coastal flooding and sea level rise threaten cities in T aiwan, China, India, the United States and the United Kingdom with an escalating risk of business interruption and increased operating costs, regardless of the future climate warming scenario."

"(continued)Potential Impacts: Workforce exposure to air pollution in the United States, China and India may continue to pose a moderate risk of business interruption and increased operating costs, regardless of the future climate warming scenario."
The risk of increased operating costs due to the price of carbon primarily occurs for facilities in Germany and China in the 4C CSA and the 2C CSA.
"This risk is greater in magnitude in the 1.5C CSA for high-emissions facilities in India, China and the United States."
"Based on the results of this analysis, we dont recognize any current material risks and, therefore, have not initiated any immediate mitigation pathways."
We plan to continue to monitor these assessments on a regular basis to stay ahead of any emerging risks.
Information on our climate scenario analysis can be found on our Corporate Responsibility Website and in our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report .

"c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organizations overall risk management."
"T o determine which risks and/or opportunities could have a substantive financial or strategic impact, potential risks are classified either as company-level, when evaluated during the materiality assessment process (see below), or asset-level, when evaluated through Qualcomms Business Continuity Program."
Company-level risks: Qualcomm regularly conducts materiality assessments to determine which corporate responsibility impacts we consider to be substantive at the corporate level.
"During the materiality assessment process, risks are evaluated based on a combined score from two indices of importance: importance to business success and importance to stakeholders."
"Importance to business success includes considerations such as impact on manufacturing and operations, technology and innovation, revenues and cost."
"Importance to stakeholders includes considerations such as governmental regulations, environmental agreements and corporate responsibility- related investment decisions."
Materiality is determined by combining a risks scores on a variety of business and environmental indices according to a proprietary weighting formula.
"A risk is considered to be material, in part, if it has a significant impact in any of these categories, and the magnitude of corporate responsibility risks (including climate-related risks) are considered with equal weight as the risks importance to business success."
Asset-level risks: Qualcomms Operational Resilience Program utilizes a risk/hazard assessment process to identify and evaluate asset-level risks on a regional basis.
The risk/hazard assessment process ranks man-made and environmental risks (including climate- related risks) using quantifiable resources to determine the likelihood of occurrence.
Consultation with site leads is conducted to rate the potential size and scope of specific impacts.
"This process is completed on a recurring basis, and the outputs are presented to the regional business continuity management teams."
Qualcomm manages risks based on the outcome of the risk analysis conducted.
The Operational Resilience Program helps document recovery guidelines and procedures to allow Qualcomm to continue critical business functions in the event of disaster.
"Disasters include local incidents, such as building fires, regional physical incidents, such as earthquakes, and national incidents, such as pandemic illnesses and impacts based on climate change."

Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.
S. federal securities laws.
Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact.
"These statements are often indicated by words or phrases such as anticipate, expect, estimate, seek, plan, believe, could, intend, will, and similar words or phrases."
Forward-looking statements represent our current judgement about possible future events.
"In making these statements, we rely upon assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances."
"We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any future events, outcomes or financial results, and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward- looking statements."
"While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results."
"Accordingly, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements."
Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are summarized and disclosed under the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed period reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and subsequent filings.
