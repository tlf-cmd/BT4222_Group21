The continual expansion of our Purpose targets depth and breadth is a key element of our strategy.
"As such, we introduced new areas included in target scope with the 2025 targets."
"As a result, in many cases, FY20 values disclosed in the FY20 NIKE Impact Report differ from those provided in this report, reflecting the more inclusive measurement scope in our most current targets."
"For the 9 Planet targets and the 3 Supply Chain targets, the target year (in which the target value is expected to be achieved) is considered the full FY25."
"For the Foundational Expectations target and the People targets, FY25 Q4 constitutes the final measurement period."

Our first-line athletes possess a wealth of product knowledge and consumer insights and are very loyal to the brand.
"Through the NIKE Athlete Experience (NAX) program, we have created accessible pathways for first-line athletes to broaden their skills and competencies, with added exposure to corporate job experiences."
NAX leverages talent within our NIKE ecosystem for future corporate opportunities and career growth.
Our retail store employees are given the opportunity to participate in several distinctive career development experiences: The Retail Experience Program (REP) invests in the first-line athlete development while allowing the NIKE corporate teams they work with to gain a first-hand perspective and to benefit from their expertise.
REP is a four-month recurring critical experience program within NIKE Tech and Digital disciplines that leverages the perspectives and expertise of first-line team members.
"After completing the REP experience, first-line athletes will return to the store to apply their learnings as they continue to build their career in retail or at NIKE World Headquarters (WHQ)."
"In FY21, eight first-line athletes participated in the REP program, increasing to 56 athletes by the end of CY21."
"The Track Stretch Program is a short-term, six-month experience across functions at WHQ that allows for critical development and exploration of different career paths and specializations."
"Through a joint collaboration, first-line athletes bring their strong marketplace, product and consumer knowledge into the corporate environment taking away deep experiences from the team they are embedded with back to their store to build their career."

"We have also updated our approach to provide greater visibility into Gateway roles, which are entry-level corporate opportunities that may be a good match for a retail store employee looking to make the transition into a corporate position."
"While NAX efforts are specifically for retail teammates, Gateway roles are accessible to all employees (retail, distribution centers and Air MI)."
"The NAX and recruiting programs team works with other functions to identify roles and job families that are good Gateway roles, which it then makes visible to first-line employees."
First-line teammates are provided a curated list of open corporate roles on the external NIKE careers site so they can easily find and apply for open roles that match their interests.
"Through the Gateway programs effort, over 40 job positions were identified as a match for first-line teammates and added to the curated list of positions visible to first-line employees."
"This resulted in significant interest from retail, distribution center and Air MI employees."
"In another new approach, store employees were offered career sessions by the retail initiatives to give them a comprehensive overview of various business functions, roles and responsibilities with Gateway roles."
"In FY21, this team hosted eight career sessions for the first-line retail community with over 630 athletes interested in pursuing NAX roles."

Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Representation & HiringQuantitative Target (Supply Chain) 100% of strategic suppliers are increasing access to career opportunities and upward mobility for women employed in their facilities We know gender diverse businesses perform better and positively impact workers.
"Unfortunately, theres a gender gap in almost every industry."
"In the footwear and apparel manufacturing industry, especially, women make up the vast majority of the workforce, but female representation decreases with the move into leadership ranks."
"To meet our target, suppliers must implement strong policies and practices that incorporate gender equity."
"We measure this target by validating supplier performance on the Gender Equity Self-Diagnostic Tool (SDT), which measures 10 domains of gender equity."
"In order to reach mature gender equity, suppliers must achieve an overall SDT score of 71% and meet thresholds in each of the 10 domains."
"While none of the strategic suppliers reached a mature level of gender equity in FY21, the first year of our five-year target, more than 95% of suppliers met our FY21 milestone to deploy and validate this assessment, develop an action plan and implement actions."
We are pleased by the progress strategic suppliers are making to meet this target by focusing on sustainable change.
"We know women make up 79% of production operators, yet only hold 52% of junior management and 28% of top management positions."
"In addition, men advanced to initial leadership roles (team leaders) at 3.5 times the rate of women."
"With this as our baseline, we know we have to help create access to career opportunities and upward mobility for women in our supply chain by increasingly building gender equitable environments throughout the strategic suppliers workforce."
"To create lasting change, we believe gender equity needs to be approached holistically throughout organizational culture as well as business operations."
We are focusing on ensuring equitable policies and practices are in place and set a strong foundation for supporting internal and external talent pipelines.

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Representation & HiringSetting Our Target In FY20, we built the SDT in partnership with the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) to measure gender equity at an organizational level specific to the footwear and apparel manufacturing industry."
We consulted with a subset of suppliers to gathering their input to help make sure the tool was grounded in real-life experience.
ICRW then worked with gender experts and critical stakeholders to bring these practices to life.
The tool is now publicly available on the ICRW website and includes supporting materials to help suppliers and others build robust gender equity capabilities.
"To lay the groundwork for this target, we focused on working with strategic suppliers to build an understanding of the importance of gender equity."
We recognize that every organization is at a different point on their gender equity journey.
"In FY21, we launched the SDT to enable factories to assess their gender equitable policies and practices and identify areas for improvement."
"All strategic suppliers completed the assessment, resulting in an average score of 56%, with each strategic supplier acting to improve their policies and practices."
"As part of the process, suppliers also submitted data on female representation across different levels of leadership."
One of the ways we help suppliers advance gender equity is through our relationship with International Finance Corporation (IFC).
"IFC brings strong gender equity experience in the manufacturing space, which will help us identify the steps suppliers need to take to achieve our gender targets and allow us to provide direct services to suppliers, including individualized support as well as broader training and knowledge building."
"In FY22, we plan to launch a talent accelerator pilot in Vietnam, with IFC, to help build the pipeline of women advancing into leadership roles."
"Along with IFC, this accelerator will be co-created with three of our strategic suppliers: Huali, TKG TAEKWANG and Ramatex."
It will also be supported by the Mekong Development Research Institute.
"This accelerator is made up of high potential female employees nominated by their managers to learn both hard and soft skills, as well as create a network with other women to help them advance in their careers."
"Informed by the first years SDT data, we are also launching a suite of bespoke trainings with external experts to help support strategic suppliers in their journey to become more gender equitable."
"Going forward, strategic suppliers will continue to complete the SDT annually and further integrate gender equitable policies and practices in the workplace."
"To assess performance, we will be looking at each suppliers score and whether they have met all foundational policies and practices."

We are also implementing specific programming to enable factories newer to this work have the support they need to create sustainable and long- lasting change.
"Engaging workers in this process is critical to assessing overall gender equity in a factory, and we are currently working on a tool to solicit worker input on how supportive and gender equitable their experience is at work to help factories to act based on the feedback from their workforce."
"We will also continue to utilize external organizations, such as ICRW and IFC, to support knowledge and capability building for suppliers in their journey toward increasing career opportunities and upward mobility for women in their facilities."
Weve seen interest across the industry as seven other retail brands have piloted the SDT in their supply chains.

"This program has been expanded to include a full diversity and inclusion vision, where the unique talent of every individual is recognized to foster a positive and respectful workplace culture."
"Ramatex used the SDT, along with internal feedback and external experts, to continue building its robust gender strategy."
The SDT helped shed light on opportunities for improvement and helped Ramatex benchmark its work to date.
"After analyzing the results, it updated its long-term strategy to include improving access to safe and convenient transportation and provided sexual harassment prevention training."
Ramatex also launched a strategy to take proactive steps to recruit women in traditionally underrepresented roles by providing training and structured rotation programs to supplement internal recruitment.
"Since the pilot, Ramatex has seen improved ratios of women in skilled roles and hired its first female mechanic."
"Ramatex also realized that 97% of illiterate employees were women, prompting it to launch an employee literacy program to help train its workforce."

Our journey to improve fire safety knowledge and practices among workers and managers started with a collaboration between the Fair Labor Association (FLA) and IOSH.
"From this relationship, NIKE developed a workplace safety facilitator program to develop soft skills so workers, managers and leaders can deliver peer-to-peer safety conversations on fire safety as well as other safety topics."
"Since the program began in 2015, over 100 suppliers have implemented the Workplace Safety Facilitator (WSF) Program, training nearly 9,000 workers on fire safety and facilitating safety programs."
The goal of the program is to enable peer-to-peer engagement by having one facilitator per 100 workers and creating a positive safety culture through group and confirmation biases.
"Machine Safety Certifications As we modernize our mode of manufacturing, improving suppliers capabilities to operate and maintain modern and automated machinery continues to be a top health and safety priority."
Our Code Leadership Standards (CLS) require suppliers to implement machine management programs and track their performance against international machine safety standards.
"Through engagement with internationally recognized safety experts Pilz, we provided advanced machine safety training and certification."

"The data is validated by worker voice, through a safety perception survey, though COVID-19 headwinds and travel restrictions have limited our ability to validate progress onsite."
"We are exploring alternative data collection methods, including virtual safety perceptions surveys."
"In FY21, we completed an effectiveness study on the online training and updated it to include more detailed assessment criteria and case studies on how to use the tool."
"At the end of FY21, 232 factory personnel, third-party consultants and NIKE internal staff had completed the online training and were able to self-evaluate their health and safety culture maturity using standard methodology and metrics."
"In FY21, we began discussion with the International Labour Organization (ILO)s Vision Zero Fund (VZF), seeking a deeper understanding of its vision, mission and strategy, which focuses on eliminating severe or fatal work-related accidents, injuries and diseases in global supply chains."
"In March 2021, NIKE participated in the VZF inaugural high-level forum, and we look to expand our relationship and collaboration with VZF , which we feel will help accelerate our compliance strategy and mitigate systemic high-risk issues with suppliers."
Spotlight Learning Communities The COVID-19 pandemic has required suppliers to be more agile and resilient.
Our largest manufacturing countries have facilitated more learning community events focused on health and safety than ever before.
"The pandemic has shown us the value of sharing best practices, thinking outside the box and exploring an opportunity to connect, learn and make tangible progress for workers and local communities."
"The learning community is a country-based forum led by a committee of strategic suppliers that meet regularly to address relevant and emerging issues, share best practices and solve common sustainability problems."
"For example, during the rise of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, many healthcare facilities were unable to treat patients due to the limited supply of oxygen."
A supplier shared with the learning community that as best practice they had donated oxygen tanks to the local government to supplement the supply.
"In response, additional suppliers donated oxygen tanks to their community hospitals."

"And thus, we are continuously building a culture where employees feel they belong, can be themselves and see themselves as part of NIKEs future."
Two key metrics that we use to evaluate this are the Engagement Index and the newly added Inclusion Index measured on our annual Employee Engagement Survey.
"Higher scores for engagement, diversity and inclusion have been demonstrated to correlate with lower turnover and higher productivity."
"Like many companies, we saw a small decrease in our engagement rankings due to the macro impact of the global pandemic and social and racial justice events in the U."
"S. Internally, we also faced significant change as a result of an enterprise reorganization and our Consumer Direct Acceleration32 strategy."
"To better understand how we can support our employees through continuous change, we began a series of sensing and listening sessions made up of focused conversations on the importance of well- being and mental health, and invested in resources such as hiring a director of well-being, and expanding associated benefits to include Lyra Health, Calm and Headspace."
We will continue to invest in this top priority for the company.
"FY21 was the first year we incorporated the Inclusion Index, as we looked to understand employee sentiment around our culture of belonging."
"Through our employee pulsing and sensing strategy, we will continue to monitor employee sentiments regarding inclusion as we continue to evolve our approach to meet our employees changing needs."
"In addition to monitoring our progress over time, its important to note that NIKE compares its results to other companies in our research vendors database."
"To be an industry leader in employee experience, NIKE scores should be among the best-performing companies, and our survey results should reflect this."

"In FY21, NIKE developed an accessibility strategy to cultivate and advocate for an equitable playing field for athletes with disabilities which accounts for one in five people in the world today."
"To support our commitments, NIKE set the following goals: Increase representation of people with disabilities at NIKE with more inclusive and intentional hiring practices."
"Elevate employee experience through a more flexible, accessible and equitable working environment for employees with disabilities."
Increase awareness while destigmatizing the word disability by expanding and promoting learning and development opportunities.

Pursue bold and innovative ideas that align with NIKEs strategic goals to establish us as an industry leader in disability inclusion.
The NikeUNITED Ability* Network expanded to EMEA to support a culture of belonging and inclusion with athletes who are disabled and create awareness and educate employees.
One of the ways NIKE looked to gauge progress was through external accessibility indices.
"For example, NIKE scored 90/100 points on Disability Equality Index with Disability:IN."
"To announce the score and drive awareness, we hosted Jill Houghton, President and CEO of Disability:IN, and held a fireside chat with Tom Clark, Ability* Network Executive Sponsor and President of Innovation."

We look forward to reporting on progress next year as suppliers begin to enter this next phase.
We want to empower suppliers to engage with and value their workers.
"We know that higher engagement leads to a more efficient, agile and committed workforce, which results in beneficial outcomes for both workers and the organization."
"Not only are engaged workers more likely to feel physically and mentally secure, they are also more likely to actively and positively contribute to their work."
"Now more than ever, engaging and valuing the people who make our products is critical."
"Our target focuses first on measuring worker experience through the Engagement and Wellbeing (EWB) Survey, then supporting suppliers in developing and embedding the capabilities needed to respond and improve these experiences."
"Since 2017, we have been scaling the deployment of the EWB Survey to reach more suppliers."

The target baselined in FY21 and wasnt measured in FY20.
"46 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Inclusive Culture & EngagementHowever, measuring worker voice is just the start."
"Recognizing that no two suppliers are the same or at the same point in their journey, we work to meet them where they are and actively support building capabilities that increase engagement."
This approach is foundational to a future where we continue to grow with those suppliers that value and engage their workers.
We also seek to drive supplier-led measurement of worker voice.
"NIKE enables a standardized approach through our guidelines on best practices in implementing worker voice tools, a process weve developed for survey vendors, and an action planning guide, driving supplier ownership and accountability."
"We have a robust network of survey vendors that leverage mobile and tablet technology to deploy these surveys digitally, which enables rapid feedback and more potential to integrate into their workermanagement communication systems."
"At the end of FY21, 23 suppliers, representing 83,960 workers, have purchased ongoing subscriptions directly with these companies, and are using them for many features, including the deployment of our EWB Survey as well as deploying digital grievance mechanisms."
"We have a suite of tools and supports such as the EWB Action Planning Guide, which helps suppliers develop and implement a process for converting these insights from workers into action and embedding these practices into their HRM systems."
"In FY21, COVID-19 continued to present unprecedented circumstances for suppliers and their workforce."
"Despite this significant resourcing impact, suppliers recognized a need to understand the engagement and well-being of their employees more than ever."
We observed suppliers investing in ways of engaging workers safely during COVID-19.
This can be observed through a significant increase in remote deployments of our EWB Survey using smartphones.
"For example, in FY21, 85% (65 out of 74) of the deployments were remote (2019: 52% remote)."
"The EWB Survey was conducted in 71 strategic supplier locations in FY21, exceeding our annual goal of 59 suppliers."
"Since May 2017, the EWB Survey has been deployed at 85 unique factories, representing more than 490,000 workers."
"Not only will we look to build the right tools and processes to support an inclusive culture and engagement in our supply chain, but we will continue to tap into survey insights to help prioritize and develop a more data-driven approach."
"We seek to identify key trends that can be shared with suppliers, building knowledge across our supply chain and highlighting opportunities to further build capabilities, together, as we progress toward 2025."
"47 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Inclusive Culture & EngagementWorker Voice We have embedded worker voice across our programs to make sure workers experiences guide our actions and understanding.
We have also found that enabling supplier ownership as a guiding principle to our work is key to help making long-term positive change for workers.
"By having suppliers build their capabilities across human resources and health and safety, we see more long-term, positive impacts on workers."
"Over the past decade, these two values have guided our approach to worker voice, enabling suppliers to take steps to help ensure workers are protected, valued, safe and have safe, anonymized ways to provide feedback to management and third parties through digital grievance channels."
"Anonymous Worker Feedback Suppliers can provide anonymized, aggregated data to NIKE, giving suppliers ownership of their data (and related actions) while enabling greater trust between the supplier and NIKE."
"To date, 100% of suppliers have shared their data with NIKE, which has enabled us to analyze it in depth to understand key areas of strength and opportunity across our supply chain and identify areas where further support is needed."
"For example, analysis in 2019 on our EWB Survey data set elevated our focus on understanding the root causes of concerns on sexual harassment as well as worker perceptions of safety in the factory."
"In FY21, Shift Project, a well-respected human rights organization, highlighted NIKEs EWB program as a best practice in their study outlining the opportunities of technology-enabled worker voice tools."
"Root Cause Analysis Through the EWB Survey data analysis, we identified a cluster of suppliers in Vietnam and Indonesia that reported higher rates from workers on concerns around sexual harassment."
"We worked with these suppliers to engage directly with the ICRW to do a deep dive analysis on the root causes and mitigations of sexual harassment in an extensive, year-long process."
The aim was to create an environment where workers are treated fairly by establishing more transparency and accountability.
"In addition, ICRW helped create more awareness of the relationship between gender power imbalances and how elevating more women into leadership roles can help address this problem."
It focused on helping suppliers assess the effective implementation of policies by engaging deeply with workers and getting a sense of how well workers Phil Knight displays his apparel-making skills in this set of photographs taken in December 1982.

"This worker- centric approach identified actionable ways suppliers could encourage reporting on harassment, improve grievance reporting mechanisms and strengthen their trainings."
"Finally, suppliers worked with ICRW to understand how to increase trust in their grievance channels by promoting these channels to workers, encouraging their use and confidentiality, and ensuring feedback is reported to employees so they know actions are taking place."
"Safety Perception Surveys As suppliers strive to move beyond meeting NIKEs foundational expectations and foster a culture of health and safety, we will deploy a safety perception survey to validate leadership and worker engagement in safety programs and processes, and training and development opportunities."

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Inclusive Culture & EngagementSpotlight Supplier Compensation We believe that a skilled, valued and engaged workforce is key for growth and sustainability."
"NIKE is working with suppliers around the world as they seek to develop strategic compensation capabilities (such as competitive wage and benefits systems that progressively meet their employees basic needs, including some discretionary income), because every employee has the right to a standard of living that adequately supports them and their families."
"We define our standards in our Code of Conduct (the Code) and Code Leadership Standards (CLS), which align to the FLAs standards on fair compensation."
"Our Approach In 2015, we started engaging our strategic suppliers to develop new compensation and benefit models."
"We created a hands-on pilot with a supplier in Thailand, synthesized our learnings in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeleys Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, and began facilitating shared learnings across our strategic suppliers."
"Since then, weve transitioned from testing new ideas to exploring opportunities for scale."
We now create forums to help facilitate the sharing of best practices across strategic suppliers and to understand their common challenges in enabling competitive pay.
"In doing so, we help suppliers assess the different capabilities needed to enable mature compensation approaches as part of their overall strategic HRM systems."
"Best practices include having integrated IT systems, benchmarking with the local labor market, aligning incentives and incorporating worker voice."
Visibility Is Key Enhancing our visibility into worker take-home pay and supplier compensation structures through our relationship with the FLA has strengthened this work even further.
"By the end of FY20, 13 of suppliers facilities in six different countries (China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Honduras and El Salvador) had completed the FLAs wage data collection tool, which allows suppliers to evaluate their wage data relative to external local living wage benchmarks where available, such as legal minimum wage, national poverty lines and estimates of living wages."
"To supplement the FLA data, weve worked with external organizations to secure data on local apparel and footwear manufacturing wages in key countries."
"This research helps inform our understanding of wages in our supply chain, in general, and how and where to focus our support for suppliers in developing their compensation systems."
"Jordan 1 Retro High Bloodline 50 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Inclusive Culture & EngagementWe have now scaled our wage data collection to 103 strategic suppliers that manufacture 80% of NIKEs product by volume and employ over 700,000 workers."
"For each of these suppliers, we have compared their wage data to external benchmarks in order to assess progress toward fair wage as defined in our CLS."
We have found these suppliers have an average gross pay of 1.9 times the minimum wage (excluding overtime) across 13 countries.
"On average, these suppliers pay 1.7 times the applicable national poverty line (where available).34 In addition we found that 53% pay above applicable living wage benchmark(s) where available.35 To supplement the current benchmarks, we also work with external organizations to secure data on local manufacturing wages in the apparel and footwear industry, along with other industries in key countries."
"This research helps inform our understanding of wage competitiveness in our supply chain, in general, and how and where to focus our support for suppliers in developing their compensation systems."
"Looking Ahead Beyond analyzing wage data, we will continue to work with factories to advance their human resource capabilities to attract, protect, retain and develop talent."
"Strategic and fair compensation is a key priority that we will continue to articulate to suppliers as part of our broader work on HRM, and in doing so, we emphasize two important elements supporting workers livelihoods and remaining competitive employers of choice in local labor markets."
"As we make progress on these approaches, we also encourage suppliers to provide anonymous feedback on our business practices through Better Buyings annual Purchasing Practices Index survey."
We use this survey to hold our business teams accountable in strengthening and improving responsible business practices in our supply chain.
"We will also continue to strengthen our relationships with civil society organizations in key regions, and particularly as it relates to the important connection between freedom of association and wages."

"Once graduated, our diverse suppliers will join a network of Academy alumni that will empower them to pursue additional business growth opportunities."
Began incorporating BD&I contract clauses in service agreements with suppliers in both EMEA and Converse.
"This commitment to supplier diversity was demonstrated across the organization in FY21, including, for example: NIKE actively engaged in the search for a presentation skills training supplier for our Global Procurement team as we sought to be intentional in our sourcing."
"Through the SupplierGATEWAY , we identified Perspectivity, a minority-owned training and public speaking business that aligned well with our culture given its deep knowledge and experience working with other Fortune 50 companies."
"Perspectivitys program received outstanding survey reviews, with most employees expressing that they will be able to immediately apply the learnings directly."
NIKE often works with general contractors who engage subcontractors when building out new NIKE Direct stores.
"By expanding its work with diverse suppliers both on the general contractor and subcontractor level, NIKE can support more minority-owned suppliers."
"This approach was piloted with the NIKE by Williamsburg store build-out, where 40% of contractors NIKE hired were minority-owned businesses demonstrating its potential."
"When NIKE repurchases shares, it looks to licensed institutions for assistance with the repurchases."
The program allows these institutions to engage with NIKE in other capital market activities.
NIKE engaged a smaller diverse supplier in its August 2021 repurchase rotation and this allowed NIKE to begin to build a long-term sustainable relationship with a diverse organization in the capital market arena.
Our strategy to expand and grow the diverse supplier base resulted in a movement of $197 million of NIKEs supplier spend in FY21 to diverse suppliers.

We began assessing sites in the expanded scope in FY21 and expect to complete assessing the majority of our remaining sites in FY22.
"Increasing Scope: Foundational Target Remediation Program At NIKE, we seek to work with suppliers that share our commitment to workers, the environment and the communities they operate in."
"However, we also recognize that in some cases, committed suppliers struggle to fully comply with our foundational expectations."
"When a non-compliance is identified, a systematic approach is key to sustainable remediation."
"To better support suppliers in their efforts to improve working conditions, we work with third-party service providers to design programs that provide the tools needed to enable suppliers to meet and importantly, to sustain, compliance with our foundational expectations."

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Foundational ExpectationsExperience has taught us that without a systemic approach to remediation of issues, improvements are often temporary, and these issues resurface in future years."
"To address this, we have designed a program that provides third-party support for suppliers to develop holistic remediation plans that seek to fully address the root causes driving the non-compliance and validates that a thorough approach was taken to implement systems needed to prevent future non-compliance through an onsite verification visit."
This approach is being piloted with six Tier 1 suppliers and will scale in FY22.
"As we extend monitoring against our foundational expectations deeper into our supply chain with materials suppliers, we also recognize that additional support may be needed to build capabilities to own and manage compliance with our foundational expectations."
We have engaged with a third-party service company to create training content on some of the most common areas of non-compliance as well as training content to support suppliers in identifying the right people within their organization to own and drive improvements of systems to support foundational performance.
"The program also offers in-depth, one-on-one engagement with each supplier to build comprehensive project plans designed to level up systems needed to achieve and maintain compliance with our foundational expectations."
This program was piloted with 10 suppliers in FY21 and will scale to in-scope Tier 2 suppliers in FY22.
"Capacity Building for Compliance and Remediation We have built targeted approaches to enable suppliers, focus distribution centers and NIKE owned and operated manufacturing facilities (Air MI) to meet our foundational expectations, as well as to transition to industry assessments, and we have designed and deployed capacity building programs."
"Finished Goods Suppliers and In-Scope Materials Suppliers As we evolve supplier expectations, we have also enhanced supplier access to training and capability building to improve management systems, adopt technical improvements in environmental, labor, health and safety standards, and to sustain those improvements."
"We are partnering with Better Work, a joint program of the ILO and IFC, which provides assessment and remediation programs to finished goods suppliers located in countries with active Better Work programs."
"In FY21, 33 factories were assessed using Better Work Factory Services to assess foundational performance."
"NIKE Adapt Distribution Center Memphis, TN 65 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Foundational ExpectationsFocus Distribution Centers To support the inclusion of focus distribution centers (DCs) in our foundational expectation target for the first time, we updated our standards to meet the needs of our DCs, increased supplier awareness of standards through training and engagement, assessed DCs against standards using industry tools and launched a remediation management program to support DCs in addressing issues surfaced through this process."
"Looking ahead, we are focused on scaling assessment tools to additional DCs and evolving remediation approaches."
"NIKE Owned or Operated Manufacturing Facilities (Air MI) We continued to invest in comprehensive safety program upgrades and management systems, formalizing a safety steering committee and governance, investing in upgraded machine-specific lock-out and tag-out procedures, and formally separating pedestrians from mobile equipment in our facilities."
We also initiated a comprehensive internal audit of all machine safety in manufacturing equipment.
"Spotlight Employment of Foreign Migrant Workers At NIKE, we have a responsibility to conduct our business ethically."
Hiring and employing foreign migrant workers carries heightened risks of forced labor due to the complex network of actors throughout the recruitment and employment process.
"Understanding this complexity, NIKE has adopted a holistic approach to address issues to which foreign migrant workers are particularly vulnerable."
"This includes strengthening our standards and expectations, identifying risks, working with global and local cross-industry, multi-stakeholder organizations and proactively advocating for our work at global, regional and local levels."
"We believe the adoption of the Employer Pays Principle, which prohibits workers from paying fees for their employment, is critical in helping eliminate forced labor risks in our supply chain, the industry and beyond."
"As a member of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment (LGRR), an initiative of the Institute for Human Rights and Business, NIKE shares the organizations aim to drive positive change in the international recruitment industry, starting with advocacy to governments and organizations for the adoption of the Employer Pays Principle."
"In March 2021, we updated our Code and CLS to drive clarity on expectations for our facilities about the types of fees that are prohibited."

Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Foundational ExpectationsNIKE recognizes the value in providing robust resources for suppliers to identify risks in their operations and build capabilities to recruit workers more responsibly.
"Building on the regional trainings offered to suppliers since FY19, in FY21, NIKE worked with the Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI) to deliver the Responsible Recruitment Due Diligence Toolkit training to all strategic materials suppliers in Taiwan."
"This training equips suppliers with knowledge and practical tools to conduct responsible recruitment due diligence, and includes post-training coaching and consultation to identify gaps in recruitment systems, develop sustainable improvements plans and prioritize them for implementation."
"In FY19, NIKE launched Verites CUMULUS Forced Labor Screen in Malaysia, a due diligence tool to help identify risks related to the recruitment of foreign migrant workers by suppliers."
"Since then, we have expanded use of the tool to all remaining Tier 1 and strategic Tier 2 suppliers hiring foreign workers in countries and regions including Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, Jordan, Egypt, Korea, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil."
This process helps us identify risks and opportunities to further support suppliers and their recruiting agents in implementing best practices and serves as an ongoing tool to monitor the effectiveness of programs in addressing and minimizing risks related to forced labor.
"NIKE believes addressing critical human rights risks, such as forced labor, often requires collective action."
We have long worked with multi- stakeholder and external organizations such as the FLA and the ILOs Better Work Program to address labor risks in our supply chain.
"Through our engagement with these and other organizations, we work to address a wide range of human rights risks, including those related to forced labor."
"For example, in FY21, we collaborated with ILO Better Work in Jordan to work toward the elimination of pregnancy testing in foreign migrant workers home countries and enhancing workers awareness on prohibition of pregnancy testing and any form of verbal abuse."
"In addition, we also supported Better Work in its delivery of several trainings to the workers of suppliers, in order to enhance a higher degree of psychological well-being, mental health and improved workplace communication."
"In FY21, NIKE also began a Strategic Partnership Program with Issara Institute in Thailand."
"All NIKE Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers operating in Thailand that employ foreign migrant workers will have access to the program enabling onsite support, expert consultation and ongoing engagement with workers and supplier management."
"At the core of the program is worker voice, where both foreign and local workers can provide feedback or concerns through multiple channels managed by Issara."
"This work focuses on building trust with workers to self-identify gaps and empowers suppliers to strengthen human resources systems to address issues, with a focus on issues impacting foreign workers."

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Foundational ExpectationsRemaining Grounded in Best Practices As we evolve our program, we maintain best practices that are key to driving meaningful impact for our foundational expectations."
Business Integration Our foundational expectations are embedded in our core business practices and are codified in our Code and CLS.
"We focus on building long-term relationships with suppliers that share our values, which supports better experiences for workers and improved environmental practices."
Supplier Lifecycle We then integrate compliance with our Code and CLS throughout the supplier lifecycle and supplier management led by our sourcing teams.
Onboarding: Potential new suppliers are subject to a New Source Approval Process.
The process evaluates the risks of starting a relationship within a requested country and requires additional approval for locations in countries identified as high risk.
Suppliers must receive an overall Bronze audit rating our base acceptable level prior to beginning full production.
"Ongoing: Once a supplier is approved, we monitor compliance with our Code and CLS through regular announced and unannounced audits conducted by internal and external parties."
Suppliers are expected to review and remediate audit findings to maintain their overall Bronze rating.
We investigate all allegations of non-compliance with our Code and CLS.
"In situations where improvements are required, we take a collaborative approach to working with supplier managers to verify corrective actions are taken, problems are remediated and that the managers have onsite verification."
"Should a supplier fail to remediate issues, they will be subject to review and sanctions, including potential termination of the supplier relationship."
"Divest: If the relationship with an existing supplier is terminated, resulting from poor performance against our foundational expectations or other reasons, our responsible exit process is triggered."
"This includes evaluation of the risks to NIKE, the workers, the local community and the environment associated with the upcoming divestment."
We take this process seriously.
It includes a reduction in production orders over a determined length of time to create the lowest amount of disruption to a business and workers that is possible under the circumstances.
"In higher-risk situations, multi-stakeholder working groups develop and monitor an exit plan to manage the risks identified."
"FY05/06 Corporate Responsibility Report NIKE was the first in our industry to publish a list of our contract factories50 20 68 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Foundational ExpectationsMonitoring Progress In FY21, finished goods suppliers onboarded common industry assessments while materials suppliers, distribution centers and NIKE owned and operated manufacturing facilities (Air MI) conducted their initial common industry assessments against our Code and CLS."
"As a result, we saw a downward shift in our ratings from 94% compliance to 85%, which was anticipated as part of the scope expansion."
"We have found that a safe and healthy workplace and working hours are the leading causes of supplier gaps against our Code and CLS in manufacturing and initial assessments in distribution centers are beginning to surface environmental, labor, health and safety issues."

"Its also why were continually creating new digital tools and resources to empower caring adults to become coaches who can create inclusive, fun environments that invite all kids to play."
And were prioritizing those facing some of the greatest barriers: starting with girls and kids from marginalized communities.
"In FY21, we directly reached nearly 600,000 kids around the world 55% of whom were girls."

"In FY21, we reminded the world that girls are made to play."
"Girls face complex cultural, social and economic barriers to play and sport."
"As a result, they drop out of sport at twice the rate of boys and have fewer sport opportunities overall."
"To help remove these barriers, NIKE released the Made to Play Coaching Girls Guide."

The Guide has been translated into 24 languages and adapted for different countries and cultures.
Another barrier girls face is access to the right apparel and equipment.
"Over the past two years, weve donated 75,000 NIKE Swoosh sports bras and 3,000 NIKE Pro hijabs through our community partners to girls around the world."

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction CarbonQuantitative Target Greenhouse gas emissions from key suppliers manufacturing and transportation operations will be at or below 2020 levels through use of renewable energy, energy efficiency and alternative fuels The significant reduction we saw in FY21 was largely due to COVID-19-related factors including manufacturing slowdown and our lowest inbound air freight rate on record."
Outbound emissions increased versus baseline in response to increasing e-commerce sales but was a smaller portion of this target.
"Manufacturing For NIKE to achieve its 2030 Scope 3 science-based emission reduction target and longer-term net zero target, it is critical that emissions from manufacturing suppliers are reduced."
Finished goods and materials suppliers account for approximately 30% of NIKEs total emissions footprint.
"Under a business-as-usual scenario, NIKE expects emissions from manufacturing to increase by more than 30% over the next five years which means that, to reduce absolute emissions during this time, we need to push beyond incremental reductions and unlock transformative solutions."
Achieving these targets not only reduces emissions but also builds shared value.
Our programs help to drive operational efficiencies and energy savings among our supply chain while also building operational resilience for a future where climate impacts are the norm.
Our manufacturing emissions reduction strategy with suppliers is built on four pillars: 1.
Expand ongoing efficiency improvements 2.
Maximize use of onsite solar photovoltaic (PV) at factory sites 3.
Procure offsite renewable grid electricity through mechanisms such as PPAs 4.

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction CarbonOnsite Renewable Energy Costs of onsite solar PV installations have declined so much that they can be less expensive than grid-purchased electricity, offering financial savings for suppliers while also reducing their carbon footprint."
"Onsite solar PV can typically provide up to 15% of electricity requirements at supplier facilities and can be scaled fairly quickly across sites, making it a major component of our renewable energy strategy with suppliers."
"Since launching in FY19, the NIKE onsite solar PV program has helped increase uptake of rooftop solar PV among suppliers across our supply chain."
"Through the program, NIKE provides technical advice and assistance, helping to reduce risk for suppliers during the contracting process and make the business case for these investments."
"In FY21, NIKE launched onsite solar programs in Vietnam and Indonesia, and suppliers added significant onsite solar PV capacity, with 25 facilities signing contracts for 32 MW of solar energy."
"In Greater China, we continue to work with suppliers to maximize the use of renewable energy through the use of solar and biofuels."
"Offsite Renewable Energy While suppliers are making significant emissions reductions through deployment of onsite solar PV, facilitating access to offsite renewable electricity through mechanisms like PPAs will offer even greater opportunities for suppliers to reduce their emissions footprint."
NIKE is exploring different ways to support PPAs across our major markets and encouraging suppliers to take advantage of those opportunities where they exist.
"In FY21, suppliers contracted over 90 million kWh/year of offsite renewable energy for NIKE production by engaging in PPAs."
"This includes Feng Tay Group, which contracted nearly 50 million kWh/year at three of their facilities in India."
"As NIKE suppliers do not have the ability to procure clean energy through PPAs in several of our major markets, we are continuing to explore and advocate for government policy frameworks to support."
"For example, we are collaborating with the U."

"Through the pilot, NIKE may be able to secure renewable electricity for nearly 100% of our owned and operated spaces in Vietnam, and suppliers will be able to power nearly 40% of NIKEs manufacturing load in Vietnam with renewable energy."
"NIKE, together with a strategic factory group, stands ready to move forward with the DPPA pilot when the program is finalized by the Vietnamese government."
"Over the past year, we have analyzed the local electricity market to select a developer to work with when program applications open."
NIKE is sharpening its policy advocacy efforts to open up renewable energy procurement opportunities in our key sourcing markets.
"At COP26, NIKE executives met with government officials and signaled our strong desire for competitive clean energy market solutions through participation in the U."
S. Department of State Clean Energy Demand Initiative.
"Also at COP26, NIKE helped to launch USAIDs Corporate Clean Energy Alliance, a coalition of businesses committed to working with governments across Southeast Asia to facilitate the rapid deployment of clean energy."
"Already, some strategic suppliers have taken innovative approaches to scale their access to renewable energy and we encourage their efforts."
"Notable among these is Shenzhou, which is seeking direct investment in a wind farm to provide renewable electricity to its factory in Zhejiang, China."
"Through a growing suite of renewable electricity solutions, NIKE hopes to continue accelerating supplier emissions reductions toward meeting long-term climate targets."
"Coal Elimination Through NIKEs participation in the UN Fashion Charter, we have a goal to eliminate coal from Tier 2 suppliers by 2030."
"In FY21, NIKE joined a collective action initiative with Apparel Impact Institute and seven other brands."
"Through the initiative, NIKE co-chairs a working group to explore how we can work collectively across brands to eliminate coal from Tier 2 suppliers."

Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction CarbonSpotlight Supplier Climate Action Program We know we cannot meet the ambitious targets laid out by the Paris Agreement and our own Science-Based Targets (SBTs) alone.
Meaningful climate action requires long-term commitments and engagement with all parts of our supply chain.
"Fortunately, NIKE has built close relationships and mutual trust with manufacturing suppliers over decades, which allow us to develop innovative products and co-invest in manufacturing capabilities."
We are leveraging those relationships to drive action on climate change.
"In May 2020, NIKE launched a new climate program with NIKEs Supplier Sustainability Council (SSC)."
The SSC is a group of strategic suppliers committed to sustainability to enhance their operational performance and mitigate risk while sharing out best practices in the hopes of elevating worker safety across the sector.
Challenges related to climate change were among the top sustainability issues raised by the SSC.
"Of particular concern were the rising cost of energy, hotter working conditions, increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, and new policy and regulation introduced by governments to mitigate GHG emissions."
"With those concerns in mind, NIKE developed the Supplier Climate Action Program (SCAP)."
Eleven of NIKEs largest finished goods and materials suppliers committed to the program and account for approximately 60% of strategic supplier emissions.
SCAP not only provides technical assistance to suppliers to help set more ambitious climate goals but also turns the process of achieving our supply chain emission reductions into an aligned strategic effort.
"The SCAP asks suppliers to take the following actions: Develop a company-wide GHG inventory Set a validated science-based emissions target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions Publicly disclose climate-related information through CDP Collaborate with NIKE to explore climate-related risks and opportunities in the extended supply chain38 Hollister Trail, NIKE WHQ Beaverton, OR 38 Facilities in Extended Supply Chain: 100% finished goods suppliers (AP , FW, and EQ); in-scope materials suppliers; focus DCs; and Air Manufacturing Innovation facilities In-Scope Materials Suppliers: Suppliers representing approximately 90% of total footwear upper materials and apparel textiles production Focus DCs: Distribution centers representing at least 80% volume."

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction CarbonAir Freight In FY21, NIKE saw the lowest inbound air freight usage on record since we began tracking (from supplier to destination distribution center)."
"Initially, the decision to reduce air freight was made to mitigate business uncertainty at the onset of the pandemic."
"Due to the substantial positive impact on our inbound carbon emissions (air freight is on average 42 times more carbon intensive than ocean freight), NIKE is working to not return to pre-pandemic air freight usage, through our Move to Zero air freight program."
"Historically, carbon emissions from outbound transportation (from a NIKE distribution center to final destination, including to the consumer) have been challenging with the growth of e-commerce sales, as we try to balance speed and carbon emissions."
"In FY21, that challenge only intensified as e-commerce sales grew even faster."
"Alternative Fuels In FY21, we continued to expand piloting alternative fuels for both ocean freight and air freight."
These pilots used biofuels made from waste streams and carried certifications from the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials and the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification.
"In total, our investments in these pilots secured alternative fuels for about 4% of our total inbound volume, resulting in the reduction of approximately 11,000 metric tons of carbon emissions."
"We continued to expand our use of alternative fuels for outbound During FY21, these suppliers completed all of the foundational requirements of the program, which includes having their science-based Scope 1 and 2 emission targets validated by the World Resources Institute (WRI)."
Those ambitious commitments cover their footprint across their entire footwear and apparel businesses (not only NIKE- related emissions) a projected 42% reduction in baseline emissions over 10 years.
This level of reduction is what is needed collectively across the globe to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
"At its heart, this program is supporting the deepest parts of our supply chain to take climate action and create ripple effects within the industry and beyond."
"Over the coming months, NIKE and the SSC will create a joint climate action plan, which will serve as a roadmap for our collective emission reduction pathway over the next 10 years."

"During FY21, the EMEA outbound team reduced outbound transportation carbon impact by using multi-modal solutions and alternative fuels."
"As a result, 28% of our total line-haul solutions are now multi-modal."
"Of our total line-haul trucking kilometers, 22% are driven on alternative fuels, mainly fueled with hydro-treated vegetable oil (HVO) solutions."
"We also began using electric trucks for deliveries in Tokyo, Seoul and Mexico City."
"In Greater China, alternative transportation methods for outbound shipping have helped reduce carbon emissions."
"Taking advantage of new railways systems, implementing alternative fuels and utilizing electric vehicles have reduced carbon emissions in outbound freight by more than 572 metric tons."
"We also began utilizing trucks to replace air freight while maintaining the same service level in digital order transportation, reducing 70% of carbon emission compared with air freight in FY21."
"We have learned there are many options available for alternative fuels with varying carbon emission reductions, limited availability and some with other potential environmental concerns."
"To enable us to make the best decisions possible based on currently known information as we begin to scale, we worked cross-functionally to develop a sustainable fuels policy, which clearly outlines definitions, criteria and guidance for fuel efforts and reporting."
"The policy is intended to provide guidance, which allow us to build effective strategies to accelerate the use of alternative fuels."
"As a bridging strategy, until alternative fuels are widely available, we also continued to offset 100% of the carbon impact of the transport of our U."

"First, the targets cover the time period from FY15 to FY30, rather than our standard five-year target cadence."
"Second, the SBTs scope reaches deeper into our supply chain than ever before and extends further than our direct influence."
"Lastly, SBTs are absolute targets, similar to our 2025 carbon targets."
"Prior to these targets, weve only had relative, per unit carbon targets."
These factors create a set of carbon targets that become more difficult to achieve as our business grows.
"While our 2025 targets help us make progress toward our SBTs, it doesnt guarantee success with our SBTs."
This necessitates that we make progress in areas not covered by our 2025 targets in order to stay on track.
"FY15FY21 Performance Scope 12 Our Scope 1 carbon emissions are increasing due to the expansion of our facility portfolio and the absence of scalable, lower carbon alternatives to replace natural gas and jet fuel."
"To counteract this increase, we continue pursuing energy efficiency opportunities and are exploring renewable natural gas and sustainable aviation fuel."
"In FY21, we developed an internal sustainable fuels policy to enable consistency in decision-making."
"We have seen great progress with Scope 2 emissions, driven by renewable electricity through PPAs, vPPAs and onsite renewable energy."
More information on our work can be found in the Carbon section of this report.

"102 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction CarbonScope 3 As a growth company, decoupling our emissions footprint from unit growth in the face of absolute carbon targets is a critical challenge to address."
Our growth has contributed to our FY21 emissions footprint increasing by 17% versus the FY15 baseline.
The increasing emissions intensity of the Vietnam electricity grid has driven up the manufacturing portion of our emissions footprint.
"Additionally, the use of higher carbon-intensive materials in footwear (such as leather) combined with increasing material use per product has also spurred much of the emissions growth."
"Another important consideration in understanding our progress is that as products that are out now in the market reflect decisions made three years ago, were not yet seeing the impact of strategies and investments made since the announcement of the SBT."
"To achieve this ambitious emissions goal we will focus on increasing environmentally preferred materials, converting factories to renewable energy and working across industries to accelerate change."

"The traditional linear system of production, based on a take-make-waste model, is outdated and adds additional strain to the worlds natural resources and ecosystems."
Brands and suppliers are bearing the cost of producing materials that go to waste while simultaneously paying for disposal.
"Additionally, todays consumers, investors, governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) expect brands to help be part of the solution."
"A more sustainable and circular future requires designing waste out of products from the start, optimizing manufacturing processes for maximum material efficiency, and then managing manufacturing material, end-of-life product and packaging via circular systems to preserve, recover, renew and regenerate its physical utility and economic value for society and the planet now and for future generations."
"This requires an integrated, holistic approach where internal teams and external suppliers work together to continuously optimize the whole system."
"WASTEFocus Area Nike Refurbished 104 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WasteMaterials Stewardship Hierarchy Waste must be managed responsibly.
"The core elements of our circular materials stewardship system include: Waste material definitions: Standardized definitions of waste generated across the enterprise based on specific characteristics relevant for planning, implementing and evaluating waste reduction; and recycling and disposition policies, strategies and programs."
Waste estimation and prevention: Systems to estimate how much waste will be generated and whats driving it at various levels of analysis from product components to aggregated waste streams at generation points across the enterprise so it can be systematically minimized.
"Data reporting and transparency: Systems to enable data relating to waste generation, recycling and disposition to be captured, aggregated and distributed across the enterprise."
"Material segregation and sortation: Clear and enforced protocols for waste type segregation, sorting and storage to preserve material quality, utility and value."
"Collection, transport and consolidation: Logistics to efficiently collect, move and consolidate waste from points of generation across the enterprise to downstream handlers for recycling, energy recovery or responsible disposition."
Waste processing: Operations that are co-located or downstream from points of generation across the enterprise that process waste materials into manufacturing feedstock that meet customer specifications for use in making new products.
These operations may or may not be owned and operated by NIKE and may or may not process exclusively NIKE waste.
"Processing can take many forms, such as sorting, grading, grinding, shredding, baling, extruding, composting and various forms of biological or chemical decomposition."

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WasteQuantitative Target 10% waste reduction per unit in manufacturing, distribution, headquarters and packaging through improved design and operational efficiency NIKE engages with thousands of suppliers to make thousands of products and is constantly innovating."
There are a myriad of potential drivers of waste that need to be systematically identified and eliminated or consistently controlled across the entire value chain if we are to achieve and sustain the global waste reduction target.
This 2025 waste target represents an expansion of scope of our 2020 targets.
We now include packaging applied at supplier facilities and our NIKE owned and operated manufacturing facilities (Air MI) within the target.
We remain on track to meet our target.
We saw a decrease in Tier 1 footwear operational waste per pair driven by continued scaling of our targeted phylon midsole defect tracking and reduction program.
"We also encouraged wholesalers to order full case units, which drove down disposed waste per unit in distribution centers."
"Finally, our EMEA distribution center closed the loop on being 100% plastic free for all digital and B2B packaging deliveries."
"Manufacturing Waste of any kind is a signal of inefficiency, which can be a signal of cost and added environmental impact."
Manufacturing NIKE products generates more than 120 million kg of waste per year.
"The upstream manufacturing of these wasted materials consumes resources, generates pollution and costs money."
Reducing midsole and outsole defects which are a major driver of waste increases factory production capacity and reduces energy and labor per unit.
"Because waste that is prevented doesnt have to be bought or made into a new material via a recycling process, waste prevention has significantly greater environmental and economic benefits than recycling."

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WasteTo prevent waste, we are focusing first on mastering the fundamentals by focusing on measurement."
"We cant reduce waste unless we measure it and understand whats driving it, so we continue to improve our measurement practices, particularly tracking bottom component defects to enable root cause analysis."
"In FY21, 17 suppliers that drive 80% of midsole waste finished implementing systems for capturing midsole defect data and increased their use of this data to identify and address root causes."
"This resulted in a 30% reduction in phylon midsole defect waste, prevented more than 2.4 million kg of waste and prevented 9.4 million kg of associated carbon emissions."

We are working diligently to understood drivers.
The data is being evaluated for potential revision in order to ensure it most accurately reflects the underlying waste and business conditions.
"108 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WasteBuilding on this foundation, we designed and began piloting a system to aggregate bottom defect data from individual factories to enable analysis across factories to identify root causes affecting multiple factories."
This system will be scaled in FY22 and FY23.
We also continued scaling a program to ship certain input materials to suppliers in reusable boxes instead of single-use cartons.
"By targeting material suppliers located near facilities where backhauling reusable boxes is practical, we prevented approximately 1 million kg of cardboard waste, reduced associated carbon emissions by 1.4 million kg and saved more than 120 million liters of water."
"However, these savings were offset by increases in single-use cartons driven by increased consumer demand for franchise models made with leather."
The cartons used for shipping leather are very heavy (up to 14 kg) and switching these to reusable boxes isnt logistically practical at this time.
"Footwear With footwear, we focus on per pair reduction, rather than total waste, because the number of pairs produced is driven by consumer/ marketplace demand (not product/design teams)."
We identified the key waste streams by mass and overall impact and are concentrating our efforts on the biggest areas of opportunity.
"In footwear creation, our biggest waste streams mirror our high-impact material zones: leather, mixed textiles, foam and rubber are among the top impact areas."
"Through FY21, our creation-led waste target was behind plan."
"While weve made progress in reducing synthetic leather and upper textile waste, traditional leather and polyurethane (PU)-coated leather continues to lead an increase in waste."
"Consumer demand for NIKE lifestyle icons (e.g., Blazer) is driving this increase usage."
"But, along with its carbon impact, leather is one of the most inefficient materials in a footwear production environment."
"To date, traditional leather waste is negating the gain weve made elsewhere and is contributing the vast majority of our incremental waste."
"More efficient leather alternative conversions are actively planned in key footwear products, with womens and kids leading the way, but we will not likely realize the savings associated with these models until end FY22 and into FY23.NIKE Move to Zero Sun Club Pack 109 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WasteClosed-Loop Recycling While our first aim is to reduce waste in the footwear creation process, we also want to create opportunities for reinserting the waste we create back into footwear product."
Our goal is to leverage at least 25% of Tier 1 factory waste back into footwear.
We work closely with the NIKE circular economy team to identify closed-loop opportunities in manufacturing centers and with our creation teams and suppliers to enable the conversion of the waste into new materials.
"We are slightly behind our preferred pace to hit our 2025 goals, but were confident were building a robust plan to increase momentum over the next year or two."
We have viable scale solutions in closed-loop rubber (the number one source for our recycled rubber is our own Tier 1 factory waste) and EVA foam.
"The greatest challenges come from converting synthetic leather and leather scrap to a viable new material, but were working across NIKE innovation, manufacturing and suppliers to develop an outlet for those materials that can be put back into footwear."
"Apparel NIKE Apparels goal is to increase efficiency in our product designs earlier in our creation and development process, which will reduce waste when those products are manufactured."
"This can be achieved through adjustments to patterns, which increase fabric efficiency in manufacturing, by using lighter weight materials where possible, and greater use of highly efficient methods of make, such as Flyknit."
"Due to system upgrades, some key product efficiency data was unavailable in FY21."
"Once the upgrade is complete (scheduled for FY22), we will baseline key product efficiency metrics and work with our consumer creation teams to set waste reduction goals, develop tracking reports and incorporate them into our target dashboard."
"Using data developed for our 2020 targets, interim goals have been rolled out to our product teams to work toward until the data/systems upgrade is complete."
Packaging The majority of NIKEs packaging in footwear is produced with over 90% recycled content.
Our 2025 target is important as it leverages the previous success in increasing the recycled content to now focus on using less.
Multiple projects have been initiated to achieve our goal of reduced packaging.
"NIKEs seasonal collections 110 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WasteSpotlight NIKE Approach to Changing Terminology Language matters.
Waste is material material that meets certain criteria that cause it to be labeled and thought about as waste.
"How we define when material becomes waste and waste becomes recycled affects how waste problems and opportunities are defined, how waste reduction and recycling strategies are developed and evaluated, how waste impacts are measured and reported, and how environmental product claims are substantiated."
NIKE products are made using a wide range of materials that are constantly evolving.
"This means our manufacturing waste streams are constantly evolving, too."
How waste gets physically segregated and measured affects our ability to identify and act on waste drivers and recycling opportunities.
"For these reasons and more, waste terms and definitions are foundational for our waste programs, and they need to evolve to keep this foundation strong as the materials we use change, and the way waste is thought about internally and externally evolves."
"To this end, in FY21, we reviewed waste terms and definitions internally and externally to assess if and where they may need to be aligned, standardized, updated or created."
"This included: Participating in the GRI Business Leadership Forum on the new GRI 306 Waste Standard Reviewing waste-related terms and definitions across a wide range of external standards and legislation governing corporate impact reporting and product marketing claims in our industry and across other industries Reviewing the boundaries of our waste accounting system to begin preparing for the multi-year process of developing 2030 targets Updating our internal Scrap Material Guide Our objective is to continuously improve our foundation for measuring and communicating what matters in a way that accurately characterizes reality, is credible and trustworthy, enables NIKE to understand and take appropriate responsibility for the impacts associated with making our products, and is meaningful to stakeholders."
"NIKE Footwear Designer 111 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WasteKey packaging highlights from FY21 include: NIKE has initiated a project to introduce two new sizes of shoeboxes used, improving the fit of the shoes within the carton."
"We utilized over 27 million of the improved fit shoe cartons in FY21, resulting in a reduction of 735,000 kg of corrugate waste shipped from suppliers in the first year of the transition."
"NIKE is also reducing the amount of toe stuffing used in our shoes and, in FY21, removed 2,232,176 kg of toe stuffing material from our packaging."
NIKE is also reducing the weight of the shipping cartons utilized to ship product globally from footwear suppliers by 24%.
"In FY21, lighter weight footwear cartons reduced the shipping carton weight by 770,000 kg in the first year of the transition."
"As a signatory to The Fashion Pact, NIKE is also working to eliminate single-use plastics in our packaging by 2030."
"By December 2021, we had successfully eliminated plastic shoppers in our retail stores."
"We are teaming with other industry leaders to research options to replace apparel polybags with a more sustainable, non-plastic alternative."
"We are also working to eliminate plastic packaging for our digital shipments with a paper alternative and are making great progress across our geographies, with our European Logistics Campus 100% converted."
We are phasing out all dunnage (both plastic and paper) in our distribution centers for the majority of our products.
Dunnage is the filler material intended to protect the product from damage in transit.
"At the end of FY21, 84% of our distribution centers used zero dunnage."
Distribution Centers Corrugated cardboard continues to be the key waste stream for disposed waste at our distribution centers.
"When customers order a variety of products or place orders of smaller quantities than factory case sizes, distribution centers must remove factory shipments from inbound corrugated cardboard cartons and repack them as customized orders which inherently creates more waste."
"As online sales have grown, we expected corrugated cardboard waste to similarly increase due to needing to repack factory case sizes to smaller e-commerce order sizes, but it did not."
One impact of online consumer sales is that it can lead to increased corrugated cardboard waste when you have to repack factory case sizes to smaller e-commerce order sizes.
"As a way to mitigate the effects of increased online e-commerce sales, we looked to our other product flows fulfilled in our distribution centers, which include brick-and-mortar shipments to NIKE Direct stores and wholesalers distribution centers Early NIKE shoebox from 1972.50 20 112 FY21 NIKE, Inc."

"We encouraged our wholesalers to order full-case factory quantities, which minimized the need to rehandle and repack for our wholesale volume."
This compensated for the effects we saw from the growth of online sales.
"At our European Logistics Campus, we moved toward 100% plastic- free digital deliveries, and all shipping boxes for Digital are now 100% recycled content."
This was the next evolution in digital packaging improvement after a 50% reduction in our total outbound digital packaging versus the original design we offered two years ago.
"Headquarters At our headquarters (HQs) globally, we continue to focus first on eliminating and then diverting waste from our operations, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero waste."
"Onsite food, catering services and custodial services create the most waste at our headquarter campuses."
"We are tackling these sources through several initiatives: adopting reusable or recyclable items for food services, custodial services and employee events, tailoring food production to demand and creating awareness through employee education."
"NIKE North America Logistics Center Memphis, TN Seb Coe Coffee Shop, NIKE WHQ Beaverton, OR 113 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WasteIn FY21, waste per occupant at HQs was down 52% compared to FY20."
This significant reduction is temporary and primarily driven by office space closures due to the pandemic.
"Over the last year, our team has made significant progress on permanent initiatives to reduce waste."
"Our Food Services began piloting reusable containers for our Grabn Go service offerings in preparation of return-to-work activities, and began developing a zero waste break room, eliminating many of the single-use items."
"At our Converse HQ, the team started a reuse-the-box program in response to the increase in shipping of product samples due to the pandemic."
This program has dramatically reduced the need for new boxes.
"In GCHQ, we continue to create awareness through employee education and the promotion of relevant initiatives, moving toward achieving zero waste."
"In FY21, an additional 1,054 GCHQ athletes participated in the Bring Your Own Box/Cup program while 1,737 employees responded to the call of the Clear Your Plate Campaign to reduce food waste."
"In April 2021, GCHQ canteens officially replaced all paper promotional materials with electronic screen displays, as well as implemented utensils made with recycled materials."
"At WHQ, our custodial team reviewed many service items focusing on what could be switched from single-use to refillable containers or reusable."
Our team was able to implement a number of items to reduce waste.
"Due to the pandemic, we have paused some of this global work but will resume as soon as possible."
"Converse One Box In May 2019, One Box was piloted at Converse as an employee passion project to find ways to contribute less consumer waste during their sneaker shopping experience."
"With growing success, Converse currently uses One Box exclusively to ship personalized shoes and has shipped approximately over 1 million shoes since."
"NIKE piloted One Box in FY21 with a ship in own container for footwear, which eliminates an outer shipping carton for single digital footwear orders."
NIKE has plans to continue to scale this program to help reduce our waste and offer a new consumer experience in the digital environment.
Climate change is very real.
"You dont have to be an expert, but I think its important for us to work together to make change happen."

"In addition, we saw greater than 90% diversion across our distribution centers and NIKE owned and operated manufacturing facilities (Air MI)."
"We achieved our manufacturing (i.e., combined Tier 1 footwear/ apparel) open-loop recycling annual milestone through increased local downcycling and Nike Grind customer demand."
"The delta between diversion and recycling rates is primarily due to challenges in recycling mixed materials (e.g., synthetic leather, textile blends, laminated materials) and leather."
"As a result, these materials are sent to energy recovery."
"Waste Diversion Footwear In FY21, 100% of NIKEs manufacturing scraps at footwear suppliers were diverted from landfills through increased recycling and maintaining sufficient energy recovery48 capacity for non-recycled waste."
"Approximately 7% of the waste that was generated was recycled through NIKEs closed-loop recycling programs, 43% was recycled into other companies products or locally downcycled, and 49% went to energy recovery."
Apparel We also exceeded the FY21 diversion target of 95% for strategic apparel suppliers.
Strategic apparel suppliers were able to increase diversion rates by expanding open-loop (external) recycling and maintaining sufficient energy recovery capacity for non-recycled waste.
FY21 was the first full year for NIKE Apparel suppliers to participate in the waste minimum program and for this data to be used for tracking and planning closed-loop recycling strategies.

"By implementing this program, factories establish a foundation for accurate and consistent reporting of key performance indicators (KPIs)."
It also creates an opportunity to reduce costs associated with waste disposal and increase revenue from the sale of waste resources.
The waste minimum program enables suppliers to continuously improve efficiency and reduce risks associated with management of waste.
"Distribution Centers In North America, we launched a Drive to 100% Food Waste Diversion program in Memphis, the first of its kind to minimize and divert food and food-associated waste from the cafeterias of our distribution centers in the region."
"By including sustainability requirements in procuring our food vendor for these facilities, we signaled the strategic imperative of starting this initiative and found a dedicated vendor."
"We identified a composting vendor and supported its efforts to enter the region, and brought together six vendors to create and implement the program."
"The vendors included: ISS Guckenheimer (food services), Atlas Organics and Compost Fairy (composting), Vegware (product replacement), and SBM (Janitorial and Sustainability Team) and Immaculate Facility Services (janitorial)."
"This work included product replacement, back-of-house food prep optimization, and employee training and education."
"In July 2020, North America Supply Chain launched the first Mid-South composting and food donation program."
"In FY21, this employee-facing program resulted in 1,500 pounds of food donations to area nonprofits and 68,000 pounds of food waste composted."
"In addition, we came full circle and used the compost created for our facility flowerbeds."
Air MI Air Manufacturing Innovation (Air MI) has a long history of recycling airsole manufacturing scraps back into new products within our manufacturing operations.
We have now implemented this practice in our foam production business as well.
"During FY21, our team tested and scaled the ability to capture and recycle foam scrap from line startup and shutdown, and batch quality testing, into new foam pellet product."
"Over the course of the year, more than 50% of production scrap was captured and recycled in-house into new batches of product."
"Additionally, the team worked to reduce the overall scrap rate per unit of foam material produced."

"We have also been able to increase annual product, furniture and office supplies donations through spring cleaning events to clear out items that accumulated in our offices."
"In FY21, globally, we saw great gains in landfill diversion, from 56% in FY20 to 69% in FY21."
We launched a cross-functional waste task force across our service lines and a more stringent data collection process that has driven focus and progress on initiatives.
"Major achievements in waste diversion for FY21 are: Our teams across the globe stepped up donation efforts, building new engagements to increase the amount of furniture, fixtures and equipment that could be donated vs. landfilled or downcycled."
Our WHQ team partnered with The Van and began selling excess office furniture and our EHQ team launched a borrow-an-office-chair program to support work-from-home activities.
"Instead of buying new, at WHQ, we continue to increase our workplace furniture reuse program."
"We reused roughly 4,100 pieces in FY21 alone."
"At WHQ, we launched a glove recycling program working with TerraCycle, and in one year, our team diverted more than 250,000 individual gloves from landfill."
"The glove recycling program is strongly supported by staff and is a tangible, everyday way for our team to be engaged in the Move to Zero."
"Based on this success, we have expanded the program to collect and divert more food service and custodial gloves with the ambition to capture and divert all single-use gloves in our operations."

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction Waste At our Greater China HQ, the team has developed a Shoe to Workplace program where excess NIKE fabrics, and old employee shoes, are collected and remade into furnishings/construction materials for the workplace."
This program is being leveraged for our campus expansion in China.
"Open-Loop Recycling49 A higher-than-expected total waste footprint for FY21 put increased pressure on achieving the open-loop recycling target, as it increased the volume of waste required to be recycled."
"As a result, open-loop recycling came in 0.8% under target."
"We recycled just over 55% of NIKEs manufacturing scrap across footwear and apparel, with increased demand from local recycling markets and global Nike Grind customers."
Recycling markets continue to be stronger for apparel than for footwear materials.
"Nike Grind For nearly three decades, the Nike Grind program has been at the cutting edge of developing circular waste systems to reuse and recycle material waste from our footwear and apparel supply chain, helping keep it away from landfills and incineration."
Some Nike Grind highlights in FY21: The Home Depot began carrying TrafficMaster interlocking gym tiles made with at least 75% recycled rubber including at least 37% Nike Grind.
"Over 750,000 pounds of rubber waste were recycled through this product."
A skateboard griptape made with 33% Nike Grind rubber recycled from footwear manufacturing scrap launched for sale online and in select skate shops.
"The griptape is manufactured and sold by Jessup, the official griptape sponsor of USA Skateboarding for the Tokyo Olympics."
"In collaboration with Lyft and the Portland Bureau of Transportation, Lyft developed and began installing ebike and scooter docking e-stations featuring at least 25% Nike Grind rubber in the top layer of the mats."

Hero Flooring uses post-consumer Nike Grind rubber from ground-up end-of-life sneakers to develop rubber flooring.
"The flooring has been installed in NIKE retail stores, office spaces and beyond."
The Nike Grind program was named as a top three finalist out of 86 applicants for Gartners 2021 Power of the Professions Award for Social Impact in recognition of our cutting-edge circular supply chain.
"In Q4 of FY21, global supply chains faced container shortages, particularly from shipments originating in Asia."
"As a result, shipments of Nike Grind materials to global recyclers were often delayed."
"Closed-Loop Recycling51 In apparel, connections between Tier 1 product and Tier 3 recyclers/ yarn suppliers are being made by a cross-functional team, prioritizing the diversion of 100% polyester textile waste to emerging chemical recycling suppliers."
Availability of polyester chemical recycling suppliers (needed to recycle textiles into high-quality feedstock) has yet to scale in most of our key manufacturing countries though.
Progress will be gradual until these programs are in place for future products.
Recycling 100% cotton and cotton-blended textile waste (which makes up the bulk of the scrap) is dependent on recycled cotton-containing materials being developed.
This work is being coordinated across cotton fabric suppliers and is challenging due to different capabilities and technologies used between them.
Closed-loop cotton waste recycling rates will remain the same until seasonal materials strategies are developed and catch up with supply.

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WasteQuantitative Target 25% reduction in freshwater usage (L per kg) in textile dyeing and finishing For the past decade, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has listed water crises and impacts from climate change among the top five global risks."
"This is important for NIKE because our supply chain spans the globe and the impacts of an otherwise local water issue, such as a drought or flood, can ripple across the supply chain and affect the consumer."
"Freshwater Reduction We continue to execute against the strategy we developed in FY15FY16, which has proven effective as demonstrated by significantly exceeding our FY20 freshwater reduction target."
"This strategy has three components: Create Awareness among suppliers that water crises are real, and its necessary to reduce our dependence on freshwater."
Drive Commitment from suppliers to do their part to reduce their freshwater use.
We collaborated with suppliers to establish freshwater reduction targets that will help us reach our 2025 target.
Build Capability among suppliers so they are executing their freshwater reduction targets using generally accepted best practices for water management and wastewater treatment.
The indications are that training and adoption of best practices are not consistent or robust.
"As a result, in FY21, we put special emphasis on training and capability building."
We ended FY21 with a 6.7% freshwater reduction from our FY20 baseline.
That is more than a quarter of the way to our 2025 target with four years to go.

"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WaterWastewater Compliance and Capability Building As mentioned in previous reports, full compliance to the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines by suppliers has been one of our greatest water- related challenges."
We are making significant progress.
"In FY20, 69% of focus suppliers (24 facilities) fully complied with the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines; and in FY21, 74% of compliance list suppliers and finished goods suppliers (104 facilities) demonstrated full compliance."
"Whereas suppliers have made excellent progress in removing manufacturer restricted substance list (MRSL) chemistries from their manufacturing, many suppliers find challenges with achieving the ZDHC foundational limits for the conventional parameters that are always present in wastewater."
Capability building is a key unlock for suppliers that treat their wastewater.
"In FY20, we assumed a leadership role to define capable through the development of the ZDHCs Wastewater Treatment System Operator Minimum Qualifications Guidelines; and NIKE became the first ZDHC brand to commit to adopting this guideline, which takes effect on January 1, 2024."
"In FY21, we started training suppliers."
"We collaborated with DuPont Water Solutions to provide four 8-hour, online training sessions on ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis."
"Two sessions were held in English, one in Mandarin and one in Vietnamese in two- hour blocks over a month."
"Over 300 water and wastewater operators and engineers in the Greater China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia attended the full eight hours."

Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WaterSpotlight Microparticles and Microplastics Research at NIKE Microparticles and microplastics have been an emerging issue in the footwear and apparel industry in recent years.
NIKE joined The Microfibre Consortium (TMC) and has assumed a leadership position in the development of the TMC Guideline to control microfibers and microparticles in textile wastewater.
"In conjunction with this guideline, NIKE has invested in research to examine how to measure and control microparticles in textile wastewater."
"Current approaches do not measure smaller particles, are highly prone to contamination and lack standardization."
"In FY21, not only did we help to identify a commercially available method to measure microparticles down to two microns, but we validated a method to capture and help prevent the discharge of those microparticles into the environment through textile wastewater by using ultrafiltration."
This is the same ultrafiltration as one of the two fundamental building blocks to a textile wastewater recycling system.
We look forward to sharing more as we make progress on this crucial issue.

"Quantitative Target 13 billion liters restored through a portfolio of projects that support long- term resilience for water-stressed ecosystems and communities within our extended cotton supply chain As the global climate changes and creates localized shifts in precipitation patterns, impacts to water availability and quality are critical to consider."
"Many of the regions that NIKE supplies cotton from face one or more water stressors, including periods of drought and water scarcity, heightened storm severity and flood events, and increased levels of water pollution."
"By focusing on projects that support the long- term sustainability of water sources and promote improvements to water quality, NIKE not only supports the resilience of our cotton supply chain but also the communities that grow it."
"These communities include the farmers and surrounding populations that rely on safe water availability, as well as the organisms in the local ecosystems that share those water resources."
"In order to achieve this target, NIKE is establishing a portfolio of projects located specifically in the water basins that suppliers source cotton from."
"The project portfolio centers on three primary focus areas: water restoration and protection, water for productive use and water access."
"In FY21, NIKE completed two water restoration projects in Australia and India."
"In Australia, NIKE supported the legal establishment and registration of a covenant that enables conservation management in perpetuity of 84,000 hectares of land in the Murray-Darling basin."
This project will allow regeneration of the land to a more natural state and prevent future commercial development.
"With this land use change, the region will see improved water quality through decreased sediment and nutrient loading, as well as increased water quantity through reduced runoff volumes and higher rates of absorption."
"In India, NIKE supported conversion of 30 hectares of farmland to drip irrigation practices in Maharashtra, engaging 75 farmers (17 of whom were women) in the project activities."
Shifting to the use of this precision irrigation method will help conserve water through increased efficiency in the drought-prone district.

Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction WaterQuantitative Target Adopt clean chemistry alternatives for our 10 priority chemistries across our supply chain Chemistry provides the foundation of our materials and products.
"From raw-material processing to product creation to new methods of make, chemistry lets us innovate and influence design, performance and sustainability throughout the value chain."
Every NIKE product and initiative leverages chemistry.
NIKEs industry-leading approach to the use of chemistry has elevated product performance and shaped manufacturing while reducing the use and impact of hazardous substances.
"Because chemistry is essential in all materials and products, it is also essential that we take a responsible, proactive role in managing our chemical footprint."
"Selecting and creating cleaner chemistry materials leads to benefits in our health, our planet and our future."
"Integrating cleaner chemistry into NIKE products supports circularity by avoiding hazardous substances, supporting material reuse for years to come."
"Our cleaner chemistry work begins with our foundational requirements set forth in the Code, requiring all suppliers to properly manage chemistry and create approaches to meet our Restricted Substances List (RSL) and MRSL requirements."
"Publishing our first RSL over 20 years ago, we launched our Chemistry Playbook in 2018, updating it annually with the latest information on RSL, MRSL and chemicals management information."
"In FY21, we met the foundational expectation that our products will meet our own RSL guideline, with no chemical issues identified in finished goods that exceeded these limits."
"More than 98% of our materials passed RSL testing upstream, with the remaining 2% improved before use in production."
"CHEMISTRYFocus Area # priority chemistries with clean chemistry alternative Target 10 FY210 0 FY20 130 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction ChemistryIt is imperative that we have transparency into the chemicals used to create our materials and products.
"We call this chemical visibility, and we are scaling industry tools to capture supplier inventory conformance to the ZDHC MRSL."
We continue to expand the scope of our MRSL conformity program year on year across the majority of our materials production.
"While this approach will not give us complete information on every substance in use today, it helps ensure that any MRSL listed substance is banned from intentional use."
This is another step on the journey toward realizing full chemical traceability and visibility.
Industry alignment remains the key to success for our compliance focused work across a shared supply chain.
"We continue to support and drive development of transparent guidelines, tools and training programs within our industry through collective action work in groups such as the Apparel and Footwear International RSL Management (AFIRM) Group and the ZDHC Foundation."
The successful scaling of these transparent guidelines supports suppliers by reducing conflicting requirements and offering capability improvements where needed.
"Together, these programs continue to accelerate us toward realizing the vision of zero discharge of hazardous chemicals."
"Nike Grind outsole Making bio-materials 131 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction ChemistryWe also have an opportunity to move beyond compliance and accelerate the adoption of cleaner, more sustainable chemistry that moves us closer to the vision of responsible and circular design and manufacturing."
"We will continue to use chemistry to create innovations that support athletes while we move toward smarter, greener chemistry inputs."
Our assessment process for new chemistries provides a consistent measure that can be used across a variety of chemistry types.
"Our process has been in place since early 2018, and weve found it to be a valuable tool for enabling new chemistries support NIKEs sustainability goals."
"As part of the assessment, chemistries new to NIKE are evaluated against the same criteria, covering a range of attributes."
"For example, it checks if they are regulated in any regions where we sell products or if the formulation contains any chemistries of concern."
"Based on performance against each attribute, the assessment provides a score that can be used to compare formulations."
The process is also adaptable so when we identify new attributes or proposed regulations we can quickly determine if any of the chemicals weve evaluated previously present a risk to the brand from their use.

Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction ChemistryWe created a list of 10 priority chemistries where we have a target to go beyond our baseline compliance obligations.
"These priority chemistries continue our journey toward cleaner chemistry, solving specific challenges that we have uncovered, and helping us advance safer materials flowing into and through a circular economy."
We believe that our success in meeting our chemistry compliance goals gives us the opportunity to work toward our ultimate vision of more sustainable chemistry and zero discharge of hazardous chemicals.
Several of the 10 priority chemistries are not currently covered by any compliance obligations.
"However, because of quickly changing regulatory landscapes and our commitment to sustainability, weve decided to identify and adopt cleaner chemistry alternatives to replace them, hopefully setting an example."
One example is bisphenols in receipt paper.
"While bisphenol A has been restricted from use in many regions, often its replacement is another bisphenol that isnt regulated yet."
"With this target, we aim to stop using any bisphenols in receipt paper and use a more sustainable alternative."
DMFa is regulated and on the RSL but the regulated limit does not disallow for its use.
We decided that we needed to not just meet the RSL limits but work with material suppliers to eliminate DMFa completely from synthetic leather production.
Zinc pyrthione is used for odor management in textiles.
It is not currently regulated but information about its potential impacts leads us to reevaluate our use.
"Based on the new data, we have a target to remove zinc pyrthione from our supply chain by 2025."
Adopting these cleaner chemistry alternatives is NIKEs 2025 chemistry target.
"For substances such as formaldehyde and NPEO, which have been restricted on the RSL for years, our targets are for specific areas where risks still exist for their use, including in recycled content streams."
"For the majority of our 10 priority chemistries, the focus in FY21 was on establishing multi-year plans to achieve targets by 2025."
We expect to see measurable progress toward these targets in FY22 and beyond.
"Move To Zero TPU Jacket 133 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report2025 Targets Appendix Our Approach Introduction ChemistryIn FY21, we drove substantial progress in our PFC phase out55."
"Since 2015, the use of any C8-based fluorinated chemicals has been banned in our products."
"In 2017, we set a target to eliminate all PFC-based finishes from our product line."
"Were doing this without sacrificing our high durability, performance standards or aesthetics."
We made significant progress in our goal as we approached our target to eliminate PFC-based finishes by the end of the 2021.
We focused on the most challenging material types and designs to enable us to achieve our target on schedule.
"Removing PFC-based finishes, especially in high-performance materials, requires product- by-product optimization and involves teams across the product creation process."
"Throughout our phaseout, we have made a point of completing a toxicology assessment on all PFC alternatives to help enable better chemistry to be substituted into the supply chain."
Our continued success and progress toward our goal of 100% PFC-free durable water repellents was made possible by close collaboration with material and chemical suppliers.
Highlights and Challenges Solvents: Our work to reduce the use of solvents in footwear manufacturing has been in progress for more than 20 years.
"Between 1995 and 2014, NIKE reduced solvent use by 96% per pair of shoes through the adoption of water-based adhesives."
But we know there is still opportunity for improvement.
"FY21 was a year of looking for opportunities to meet our 10% reduction target by reviewing models, production numbers and solvent fractions in key areas where we use solvents, including in inks and paints applied to footwear."
"Lacking an industry approach with tools to monitor and calculate volatile organic compound (VOC) reduction, we are building the tools to collect further information."
"Once these tools are available, we can leverage them in other areas."
"NPEO-free recycling processes: While critical to advancing circularity, the use and reuse of materials from outside our typical supply chain presents challenges for ensuring chemical constituents in the product."
"As we consider new and different recycled or upcycled material streams, we face new challenges in ensuring these materials meet our extensive chemical guidelines."
"Each input stream, whether it is from our industry, from other industries, or pre- or post-consumer items, creates distinct challenges for brands to manage."
Ensuring post-consumer materials are processed and prepared in a way that 85% of footwear uses PFC-free finishes 100% of accessories use PFC-free finishes 72% of apparel uses PFC-free finishesAt the end of FY21: 55 Our PFC phase out includes all per- and poly-fluorinated (PFAS)-based finishes.

The lessons learned and systems developed to achieve this target will provide a roadmap for addressing similar challenges with other legacy chemicals that add complexity to circularity.
Unintended consequences: Addressing our 10 priority chemistries is just one piece of our overall sustainable chemistry journey.
"We are also working to enable the cleaner chemistry alternatives we champion, and any new materials used in product will not become problematic in the future through our chemistry assessments."
Our chemistry experts go beyond simple hazard identification when evaluating chemicals.
"We compare chemistry options at many steps along the way, where we collaborate with designers, chemists, engineers, safety professionals and more."
"All of this work is required to make the right chemistry selection for NIKE, our athletes* and the planet."
"This drives our sought-after adoption of cleaner, more efficient, better chemistry."

"70 Focus factories are key strategic contract factories within our supply chain that represent the majority of finished goods production of NIKE Footwear, Apparel and Converse Footwear."
71 The reported injury rates reflect a combination of NIKE full-time and certain external temporary workers.
"72 Using CY20 BLS rates as BLS rates for CY21 had not been published at the time of the FY21 NIKE, Inc."
Impact Report publication.
73 Data is collected based on U.
"S. legal reporting requirements, reporting on all NIKEs operations except retail, which is excluded from OSHA recordkeeping requirements."
Retail will be included in future reports.
74 Continual process improvements in our distribution centers have allowed us to have a reduction in our year-over-year TCIR.
75 The industry average comes from the United States Department of Labor; Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"Each industry classification (such as DC, Air Manufacturing Innovation (Air MI), Offices, Footwear Manufacturing, Apparel Manufacturing) reports a separate average for recordable injuries and lost time rates (which are captured)."
76 A surge in product demand in a tight labor market is the primary driver behind the increase in injury rate.
"At the beginning of 2019, a number of employees elected to work overtime in order to meet production demands."
"We then added over 500 temporary workers to staff the production demands, many of whom had never worked in a manufacturing environment before."
We have since stabilized our workforce and are seeing a downward injury trend that we expect to continue.
"77 Air MI injury rate was influenced by COVID-19 with interruptions in work, adjustments to manufacturing process and the addition of hundreds of temporary workers to augment the workforce."
78 Tier 1 focus factory data is self-reported by factories and may be incomplete.
"At the time of the FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact Report publication, December 2021 data was estimated for factories where actual data was unavailable."
The BLS does not calculate manufacturing rates for equipment/accessories.

Emissions data is calculated using primary activity data and extrapolations.
"CO 2e emissions include CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O."
NIKE Brand and Converse footwear finished goods manufacturing emissions data is derived from 100% primary data and represents nearly 90% of the emissions in finished goods manufacturing.
"For this subset, vendors provide monthly energy consumption: from the local utility grid, onsite generators, other fuels, and purchased steam."
For electricity: kWh values are multiplied by CO 2e emissions factors for electricity purchased from the local utility grid by the country/region in which the factory resides.
For onsite generation and other fuels: CO 2e emissions are calculated using the IPCC bottoms up calculation methodology.
"CO 2e methodologies are used for emissions estimates outside of footwear finished goods manufacturing based on lifecycle analysis data applied to product creation data, and employ conservative assumptions to avoid understating NIKEs footprint."
"To evaluate NIKEs value chain footprint, we identified and quantified CO2e emissions created at each stage of the value chain."
"The impact of each individual product differs considerably, based on its profile, materials used, size and weight, method of manufacture, and location of production, use, and disposal."

"NIKEs management is responsible for its assertion and for the selection of the criteria, which management believes provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the sustainability metrics."
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on managements assertion based on our review.
"Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements."
Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to managements assertion in order for it to be fairly stated.
"The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from and are substantially less in extent than, an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether managements assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion."
"Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion."
"Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been performed."
We believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion.
We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement.

Impact ReportOur Approach 2025 Targets Introduction Appendix Assurance ReportThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment.
"In performing our review, we performed inquiries, and for a selection of specified metrics, performed tests of mathematical accuracy of computations, read relevant policies to understand terms related to relevant information about the specified metrics, reviewed supporting documentation in regard to the completeness and accuracy of the data in the specified metrics, and performed analytical procedures."
"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty because of such things as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to calculate GHG emissions, and the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions."
"Environmental and energy use data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature and the methods used for measuring such data."
The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.
"The preparation of the other sustainability metrics requires management to establish the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make assumptions that affect reported information."
The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.
"As discussed in managements assertion, the Company has estimated GHG emissions for certain emissions sources for which no primary usage data is available."

"Activity data used to calculate Scope 3 inbound and outbound emissions are sourced from third-party invoices (e.g., supplier expenditure including weight, transportation type, distance, and weight/ volume) and is collected across the business via a variety of internal processes and systems."
"As described in this assertion, activity data for Scope 1 and Scope 2 is sourced from estimates where actual consumption data is not available."
NIKE continues to work on obtaining systematic access to more actual consumption data.
Estimates are described in more detail below.
Reported data has been rounded to the nearest whole number.
Estimation Methodology Estimation methodologies employ reasonable assumptions to avoid understating NIKEs emissions footprint and are described below.

"S. and Canada)Where actual data is not available, natural gas usage is estimated for sites outside of the U."
"S. and Canada, and for landlord-managed sites in the U."
S. and Canada.
"Square footage of retail and non-HQ offices per country is used, along with country-level climate assumptions and CBECS energy use intensity (kWh per square foot) based on climate region."
In the U.
"S. and Canada, where some sites are landlord-managed and visibility on energy consumption is low, our internal known average country-level energy use intensity is used instead of the external CBECS benchmark."
"Approximately 91% of retail scope 1 emissions in FY21 were estimated, and approximately 89% of non-HQ scope 1 emissions in FY21 were estimated."
Electricity (retail and non-HQ offices outside of the U.
"S., Canada, and EU, and landlord-managed sites in the U."
"S., Canada, and the EU)Where actual data is not available, electricity usage is estimated for sites outside of the U."
"S., Canada, and EU and for landlord-managed sites in the U."
"S., Canada, and EU."
"Square footage of retail and non-HQ offices per country is used, leveraging actual FY21 square footage data, along with electricity intensity (kWh per square foot of known FY21 NIKE electricity usage in retail or offices)."
Approximately 96% of retail scope 2 market-based emissions in FY21 were estimated.
Approximately 77% of non-HQ scope 2 market-based emissions in FY21 were estimated.
Propane (DC) Propane usage at one DC is estimated leveraging propane consumption intensity at a comparable DC based on relative square footage.
"Fugitive emissions from refrigerant gas loss (DC) Refrigerant leakage from HVAC units was calculated by applying an operating emission factor (i.e., leak rate) of 10% (sourced from EPAs Direct Fugitive Emissions from Refrigeration, Air Conditioning, Fire Suppression, and Industrial Gases) to the total system capacity across all units."
The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of R410a was sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report published in 2014.

"Management AssertionEmission Factors Emissions are reported in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and include CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O."
"Exceptions to reporting CH 4 and N 2O are as follows: Facilities emissions are reported in CO 2e, however, within a limited subset of consumption data, emission factors for other gases (CH 4, N2O) are not provided."
"These exceptions include AIB/EU Residual Mix Emissions factors, Green-E/US Residual Mix, and certain supplier- specific emission factors."
"In these cases, CH 4 and N 2O emissions are sourced from the next available source in the market-based emission factors hierarchy."
Commercial Travel emissions are in CO 2 due to data availability.
The emissions from other gases are not material to NIKEs reported GHG emissions.
"Carbon dioxide emissions and equivalents resulting from the activities and business units described above have been determined on the basis of measured or estimated fuel and electricity usage, multiplied by relevant, published carbon emission factors, which are updated annually according to an internal policy to use the most recent emission factors available before the annual internal cutoff date, which is 15 days after the fiscal year end."
"Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions utilize GWPs primarily sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (Assessment Report 5 100 year), and EPA emission factor sources use Assessment Report 4."
"In quantifying market-based electricity GHG emissions, GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance defines a hierarchy of factors for quantifying market- based emissions, in order from highest to lowest precision."
The table below describes the hierarchy and the relevance to NIKE for the current year reporting.
Emission Source Type Emission Factor Employed Direct Line Connection Not applicable Energy Attribute Certificates NIKE applies a zero emission factor for on-site solar and wind generation where Renewable Energy Credits (or Guarantees of Origin) generated are retained by NIKE and for purchased renewable energy attribute certificates applied to NIKEs operations.
"Biofuel renewable energy credits employ a zero emission factor for CO 2;, biofuel source- specific emission factors are applied to fugitive emissions for CH 4 and N 2O and are not material."
Electricity Contracts NIKE applies a zero emission factor for all facilities in scope of its power purchase agreements.
Energy Supplier-Specific Emissions Factors U.
"S., Canada and EU: NIKE applies publicly available supplier-specific emission factors where available."
Residual Mix U.
S. and Canada: NIKE applies residual mix emission factors from Green-e Energy U.

"Management AssertionUncertainty GHG emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty because of such things as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to calculate GHG emissions and the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions."
"Environmental and energy use data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature and the methods used for measuring such data."
The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.
"The preparation of the other sustainability metrics requires management to establish the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to be included, and make assumptions that affect reported information."
The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.
"NIKE recognizes that commercial air travel and logistics remain an estimate since unforeseen circumstances can occur (e.g., different routes due to adverse weather or unforeseen aircraft fleet changes), however the figures presented are considered to be a reasonable estimate of NIKEs commercial air travel and logistics emissions."
"Water Background In support of its Water Restoration target, NIKE funds project work aimed at supporting the long-term resilience of the water basins within its extended cotton supply chain."
"Thus far, NIKE has not implemented water restoration project activities itself, but instead supports project activities and implementation conducted by third-party partners (typically NGOs)."
"Additionally, NIKE partners with third-party engineering firms to calculate approximate restoration volumes and tracks the volume of water restored through these projects."
"Since the inception of NIKEs Water Restoration projects in India and Australia, NIKE has funded more than $550,000 for the two projects."
"167 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact ReportOur Approach 2025 Targets Introduction Appendix NIKE, Inc."
Management AssertionScope NIKEs water restoration efforts focus on regions in Tier 4 of its cotton supply chain.
NIKE only considers water restored through this portfolio of projects when calculating progress towards the water restoration target.
Additional water restoration that occurs incidentally in or through unrelated NIKE activities is not included.
Estimation Methodology NIKE works with project implementation partners and third-party engineering firms to quantify volumetric benefits from the water restoration projects.
"This quantification approach aligns with the World Resources Institutes Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting Methodology and uses the United National Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) CROPWAT program, version 8.0 of CROPWAT and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, version 1.2.1 of SWAT (QSWAT+)."
Data inputs for quantification are provided by the project implementation partners and estimated volumetric benefits are discussed and confirmed with project partners and third-party engineering firms.
"Conservatively, we assume that the benefits would accrue at a rate of approximately 20% per year for the first two years and 50% per year for years three and four."
Beginning the fifth year the full volumetric benefits will be claimed.
"An external engineering firm determined NIKEs share of the total volume of water restored in FY21 was 2,063,366,665 liters."
The project types included in this volume of water restored include: 1.
"Agricultural water demand reduction measures (Beed District, Maharashtra State, India) a."
VWB Indicator: Reduced consumption b.
Calculation Method: Consumption method 2.
"Land conservation (Nimmia-Caira Wetlands, New South Wales (NSW), Australia) a."
VWB (Volumetric Water Benefit) Indicator: Avoided runoff b.
Calculation Method: Curve Number method 3.
"Wetland restoration and creation (Nimmia-Caira Wetlands, NSW, Australia) a."
VWB Indicator: Increased recharge b.
"Calculation Method: Recharge method 168 FY21 NIKE, Inc."
"Impact ReportOur Approach 2025 Targets Introduction Appendix NIKE, Inc."
"Management AssertionUncertainty Volumetric water benefit quantification is subject to inherent measurement uncertainty as, short of project work that can accommodate water meters or similar tracking technologies, the interventions that support water restoration are nearly impossible to directly measure."
"Additionally, the data types needed for these projects are often variable, such as climate conditions, flow rates, irrigation efficiency, soil types, and evapotranspiration rates."
"Using WRIs VWBA Methodologys calculation methods and best estimates for data inputs, NIKE and its partners work to limit uncertainty to an acceptable degree."
The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could result in materially different amounts of metrics being reported.

"Data Integrity Sustainability data is shaped by a landscape of evolving methodologies, advancing standards, and expansions in data accessibility over time."
Adapting to these changes while maintaining comparability in our data is critical to instilling integrity and confidence in the validity of the insights the data provides.
We understand that we must adapt and be nimble to keep pace with broadening data sets and emerging standards.
We continue to focus on the internal controls in our sustainability data processes and systems.
"We have obtained external assurance on select reported metrics (Scope 1 and 2 energy consumption and emissions, renewable electricity, Scope 3 commercial air travel emissions, and inbound and outbound logistics emissions; selected diversity and inclusion data; and cumulative water restoration funding)."
More information can be found in the appendix.
"In cases where shifts in scope, methodology and/or data quality have led to changes in previously reported performance results, weve restated historically reported results and provided context on the changes in the Restatements section of the Appendix."
"The data presented in this report has been collected through a variety of processes, reviewed and internally validated, and represents the most complete and accurate information at the time of publication."
NIKE will continue to be transparent on revisions to reported data in the future.
FY20 was the target year for our FY20 targets (FY1520) and is the baseline year for the majority of our 2025 targets.
The continual expansion of our Purpose targets depth and breadth is a key element of our strategy.
"As such, we introduced new areas included in target scope with the FY25 targets."
"As a result, in many cases, FY20 values disclosed in the FY20 NIKE Impact Report differ from those provided in this report, reflecting the more inclusive measurement scope in our most current targets."
COVID-19 Methodology Estimation methodology for FY20 Q4 COVID-19 slowdown adjustments are as follows: Carbon Scope 1 and 2 Emissions (except for HQ security vehicles); Transportation Emissions Activity Data: FY20 Q3 trailing 12 months ((TTM); FY20 Q4 = FY19 Q4).
"Emissions Factors, Scope: unadjusted FY20."
Carbon Manufacturing Emissions Activity Data: FY20 Q4 = percent of FY observed historically.
"Emissions Factors, Scope: unadjusted FY20."
Waste Manufacturing and Packaging FY20 Q4 = average of Q13.
"Waste DCs, HQs, Air MI FY20 Q3 TTM."
Water FY20 Q4 = average of Q13.
"Due to the effects of COVID-19, the fourth quarter of FY20 (March 2020May 2020) resulted in lower than normal production, impacting the final measurement year of our FY20 targets and baseline measurement year of our FY25 targets."
"To help enable measurement consistency and avoid the inevitable artificial reductions in performance metrics during this unprecedented time, continuing our approach from our FY20 NIKE Impact Report, we have adjusted Q4 performance figures for the targets that were most impacted (carbon, waste and water)."
These Q4 adjustments generally reflect an FY20 Q3 trailing 12-month view of performance and provided a more conservative view of where we landed on FY20 targets than would be rendered using actual performance figures during the global shutdown.
These adjustments had the effect of inflating our footprint to resemble business as usual and were only applied to targets where we were aiming for a reduction in impact vs. baseline (reduction targets) and to targets where we were aiming to reach a certain percentage (reach targets) that share underlying data with reduction targets.
None of the adjustments resulting in meeting targets that we would not have met if we didnt normalize our performance to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 slowdown on our FY20 targets target year and FY25 targets baseline year.
We carried this approach through to measuring performance toward our FY25 targets to ensure consistency in how we accounted for the pandemic across target periods.
