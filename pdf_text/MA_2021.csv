"In the years between formal assessments, we refresh the results as needed."
We found that perspectives from both internal and external stakeholders are aligned.
"We act on each of these issues, but prioritize those that are of greatest importance to our stakeholders and our business."
"We then establish ambitions, goals and targets, aligning efforts on each issue in accordance with its materiality."
"We are focused on a handful of topics that were identified as priorities, including financial inclusion; diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI); climate; and data responsibility, privacy and security."

"We also collaborate with them to provide access to affordable tools and services for small businesses to grow, and to build digital infrastructure to reach remote communities."
"As part of our involvement with PCA, we signed a six-year agreement with the Ministry of Economy in Guatemala, the largest economy in the region."
Guatemala City became the first Central American capital to join Mastercard's City Possible platform.

This means accelerating active steps to reduce our carbon emissions and working with our suppliers to make similar commitments.
But our impact can be even more substantial when we engage our global network of customers and partners to drive collective climate action.
"To realize this vision, we are developing products and solutions that harness the power of our global network to help encourage environmentally conscious consumer behavior."
"Sowmya Srinivasan Specialist, Product Management CHAPTER 1 HOME CHAPTER 2 CH HOME CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 3 CHAPTER 5 CHAPTER 4 CHAPTER 1 APTER 3 CHAPTER 4 CHAPTER 5 A PPE N D I X 4422 CHAPTER 3 CHAPTER 4 CHAPTER 5 A PPE N D I X Our approach In 2021, we moved up the target date of our commitment to reach net-zero emissions by a decade, from 2050 to 2040."
"We launched initiatives to help us meet that goal, including formally linking executive compensation to carbon neutrality (or the 100 percent offset of our operational Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions) so our leadership teams are held accountable for these commitments; increasing outreach to our supply chain to encourage and assist them in setting their own net-zero targets; tying corporate debt financing to green initiatives; and continuing employee engagement in helping to achieve goals like waste management and recycling."
"This work builds upon Mastercards existing emissions reduction targets, approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our operations and supply chain by 2025 from a 2016 baseline."
"We are also seeing increased adoption of global programs like our Sustainable Card Badge and Certification Program, which promotes usage of non-first- use polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the manufacturing of payment cards, in favor of recycled and other more sustainable materials; initiatives like Priceless Planet Coalition and Carbon Calculator; and new programs like our Sustainability Innovation Lab and Wildlife Impact cards."
"These programs differentiate Mastercard from our competitors, while helping to promote sustainable consumer behaviors."
"To further our efforts to promote environmental stewardship and inclusive growth, we issued our first-ever Sustainability Bond in March 2021."
"Net proceeds from the 10-year, $600 million senior notes will be allocated to eligible ESG investments, expenditures and contributions."

It is not enough to simply address operations to drive meaningful environmental change.
Consumers rapidly shifting attitudes toward corporate responsibility and environmental sustainability are now affecting their spending choices.
"In a Mastercard survey , completed by YouGov in 24 countries in 2021, 85 percent of consumers said theyre willing to take personal action to combat environmental and sustainability challenges."
And 62 percent say its now more important than before that companies behave in a more sustainable and eco-friendly way.
We are continuing to build capabilities to meet growing consumer demands for sustainability-oriented products and solutions such as the Priceless Planet Coalition and the Carbon Calculator.
"These programs are intended to galvanize our network of issuers, banks, retailers, merchants and cardholders to prioritize environmental conservation."
"We can help cut global carbon emissions, for example, by helping our customers consider more climate-conscious purchasing behaviors."

The Coalition has engaged more than 85 partners globally.
Consumers and customers have the opportunity to support our efforts to protect our planet through forest restoration programs via Mastercard Donate and the new cause-related marketing campaigns offered in 2021.
Restoring forests is widely recognized by the global scientific community as a cost-effective and efficient approach to addressing the climate crisis.
"Through photosynthesis, trees naturally absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in their roots and soil."
"And they provide other benefits food, shelter, tools, homes for wildlife, and regulating the freshwater cycle, to name just a few."
"This work involves much more than simply planting trees, however."
"It is a large-scale, high-value conservation opportunity that prioritizes benefits for climate and biodiversity by engaging and directly benefiting local people to promote a sustainable economy."
"We have committed to this re storation goal with Conservation International and the World Resources Institute, whose reliance on proven science helps them guide investments to areas where restoration can be conducted in the most ecologically and socially responsible ways, and delivers the best chance of success to drive positive impact."
"This means planting the right trees in the right places to maximize benefits for climate, community and biodiversity, and employing globally consistent monitoring and maintenance protocols."
"Our restoration projects will not utilize invasive species, nor any species destined for timber harvest, and will employ only ecologically and socially appropriate restoration methods, as determined by each individual project and location."
"We calculate not only how many trees have been regrown and, as projects mature, the approximate carbon capture impact they have had, but also how our work benefits the communities who reside in and around these landscapes."
How the forest landscape and biodiversity are thriving over the long term is another standard measurement.
"Ongoing monitoring includes baseline, first-year and long-term protocols for each project, with coordinated global analysis for the entire program, including geospatial and remote sensing, satellite and drone technology, and field-based sampling and ground-truthing methods."
"Our ongoing statistical evaluation ensures efficacy and maximizes accuracy and efficiency, while counterfactual control sites matching the original conditions help determine additionality."
"In 2021, we initiated three projects, in Australia, Brazil and Kenya, as the inaugural restoration programs of the Priceless Planet Coalition."
"Through the generous support of our Coalition partners, work will continue at these sites through 2022."
"Additionally, 15 new restoration projects, announced in 2022, have been added to the portfolio, for a total of more than 12 million trees funded through restoration grants."
Mastercards Donate technology helps power the Priceless Planet Coalition by enabling consumers to donate directly to its mission to restore 100 million trees by 2025.
More than 25 distinct campaigns utilizing Donate technology to support the Priceless Planet Coalition were launched across eight countries in 2021.
Funds were collected online through social media and websites thanks to the Mastercard Donate Widget .
"When our cards were used in-store at partner merchants, cardholders had the opportunity to donate a small, fixed amount or to round up their purchase to the next monetary unit to donate."
We unite with our partners in the commitment to restore 100 million trees over five years.

It allows consumers to see the estimated carbon footprint of purchases across spending categories.
"Then, they can make purchasing decisions to reduce that environmental footprint."
"It is the first calculator in which the technology is integrated at the core network level, meaning all Mastercard transactions can be scored using the tool."
"That makes it easy for banks to implement and get into the hands of consumers, allowing for fast scaling."
Our partners can embed carbon tracking in their digital products through easy-to-use APIs.
"Mastercard is the first payments network to integrate carbon emission calculations this way, and was recognized by Fast Company as a 2021 Innovation by Design Awards honoree."
"Mastercard Donate technology is also seamlessly integrated into the Carbon Calculator, empowering people to donate to Conservation International and helping restore forests."
"When presented with the approximate carbon impact of their monthly card spend in their issuers mobile banking app, cardholders can choose to donate to forest restoration initiatives that achieve significant impact by counterbalancing CO2."
"SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION LAB In September 2021, we announced the launch of our Sustainability Innovation Lab, the first of our innovation hubs to focus exclusively on sustainability- oriented products and solutions."

This program highlights the urgency for action with its cards that carry expiration dates reflecting the projected extinction of many critically endangered species.
We also launched virtual prepaid cards that customers can add to any mobile wallet.
The virtual gift card program was launched in May 2021 on Endangered Species Day and will expand into credit and debit physical card issuance in 2022.
"As part of this initiative, we expanded our relationship with Conservation International to guide and lead our efforts to protect and restore wildlife habitats around the world."
The Wildlife Impact program will support Conservation Internationals work to protect and restore 40 million hectares of landscape and 4.5 million square kilometers of seascape globally by 2030.
Consumers can also make donations to this cause directly via the Mastercard Donate platform.
SUSTAINABLE CARD BADGE AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM Mastercard is equipping consumers and businesses with certified sustainable cards with no compromise on quality or technical specifications.
"We are working with 199 financial institutions in 57 countries to develop cards made from eco-friendly materials , like recycled ocean plastic and bioplastics made from Thai sugar or Nebraska corn, in order to reduce use of first-use PVC plastics."
We also now include a badge on the cards to help consumers identify those that are made with sustainable components.
These materials are verified by an independent certification program that assesses vendor sustainability claims to offer greater transparency and clarity for issuers and cardholders.
"From 2018 to the end of 2021, there were 60 million Mastercard-branded cards produced with approved sustainable materials using Mastercards Sustainable Card Materials Directory."
Thats up from 10.7 million at the end of 2020.
A toolbox of recycling services is under development to divert waste from landfills by helping consumers retire their cards more sustainably.

"We are continuing efforts with our suppliers, who account for more than 70 percent of our Scope 3 emissions, through engagement, interventions and target-setting."
"In pursuit of decarbonizing our global operations, we continued a multitude of programs, including utilizing 100 percent renewable energy, investing in green buildings, and setting targets with the SBTi in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement."
"Our decarbonization plan continues to advance, with short-term targets being established to enable us to reach the ultimate 2040 net-zero goal that will be submitted to SBTi for approval in 2022."
Mastercard was among the first in the global payments industry to incorporate supply chain emission reductions into our net-zero target.
We have developed a supplier engagement program that will help us achieve our 2040 net-zero goal.
"In addition, our short-term target calls for reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 38 percent, and Scope 3 GHG emissions by 20 percent, between 2016 and 2025, aligning us with the 2015 Paris Agreement."

"The process includes developing and implementing policies for cleaning and sanitizing procedures, emergency preparedness, health service resources, air and water quality management, and stakeholder engagement and communication."
We also surpassed our 2020 commitment to divert 85 percent of the waste generated by Mastercard-owned sites.
Our ultimate goal is to achieve zero waste at all our owned facilities and many of our leased sites.
"Location highlights Following a three-year renovation, our Tech Hub opened in Manhattan."
"More than 216,000 square feet were renovated."
"During the design and construction, the team collected and accounted for the embodied carbon from materials used and purchased for the new build-out."
"That data will help us refine operations, modify purchasing decisions and meet our emission reduction goals."
"To connect our clients and employees to nature while in the building, we added elements like a living moss wall and outdoor rooftop access."
"In addition to attaining LEED Gold certification, the Tech Hub also achieved Mastercards first Fitwel certification , showcasing wellness within the design, development and building operations."
"Our new Dublin, Ireland, office building was certified as LEED Platinum, the highest distinction available, and received Well Platinum certification, a first for Mastercard globally and a first for that city."
Our New York and Dublin buildings underwent full-site commissioning following construction to verify that they are operating as designed and intended.
DATA CENTERS All our owned data centers use 100 percent renewable energy.
Two-thirds of them rely on solar energy produced on-site.
"We continue upgrading and adding energy-saving projects to meet or exceed energy targets in our owned properties, and we monitor power-use effectiveness levels for our owned data centers, as well as our co-location sites."
"Our LEED Platinum technology hub in OFallon, Missouri, achieved a new certification from the U."
S. Green Building Council: LEED Zero Energy .
It complements our existing LEED certification and verifies that we achieved our net-zero goal for this location.
"For this certification, we used on-site solar panels to displace nonrenewable grid energy."
The OFallon site was the first of any Midwest location to achieve LEED Zero Energy certification.
Mastercard is also a member of The Green Grid .
"The Green Grids mission is to work globally to create tools, provide expertise, and advocate for resource efficiency in order to enable a low-carbon economy."
All our owned data centers use 100% renewable energy.
"CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 3 CHAPTER 5 A PPE N D I X CHAPTER 4 50 HOME CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 3 CHAPTER 5 APPENDIX CHAPTER 4 CHAPTER 1 HOME CHAPTER 1 HOME CHAPTER 1 RENEWABLE ENERGY Mastercard has been 100 percent renewable since 2017, initially through the purchase of renewable-energy credits."
"In 2020, we joined RE100 , refocusing our efforts to bring renewable energy onto the grid, using a four-pronged approach."
"The first and most effective effort is implementing direct renewable energy through on-site development, which can be done only at our owned facilities."
"This includes solar panels in our OFallon, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri; and Purchase, New York, locations."
Our second approach involves long-term renewable-energy credit deals: We have 5- to 12-year agreements with our utility providers or third parties in the U.
"K., Australia and other locations."
The third component is buying in-country renewable- energy credits at our global sites that are too small for long-term agreements.
This helps green the grid by signaling a demand for renewable-energy credits and providing financing for renewable energy.
"Our final approach, in countries without a renewable-energy credit market, is to purchase renewable-energy credits in neighboring countries that are connected to the same grid."
Our goal is to reduce our number of unbundled renewable-energy credits and increase longer-term sources of renewable energy.
We continue to investigate ways to bring renewable energy onto the grid wherever we do business.

"We have committed to active supplier engagement and development, especially among our small suppliers, to help with accountability, target-setting and regular reporting."
"To assist in this process, we developed a four-stage environmental sustainability supplier engagement model that has led to constructive engagement and collaboration."
"The model calls on us to invite suppliers to: D isclose their carbon footprint by completing the climate change questionnaire from CDP , a nonprofit disclosure system for managing environmental impacts L everage educational resources and assist them in advancing environmental programming E valuate and align on key performance indicators C ollaborate to find ways to reduce emissions together ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT MODEL Disclose Leverage Evaluate and align Collaborate When we first announced our net-zero goal in January 2021, only 1 in 10 of our top GHG-emitting suppliers had their own net-zero targets."
"For the fourth consecutive year, we received an A rating from CDP in 2021 for supplier engagement."
"Supplier response to the CDP survey increased 9 percent year-over- year, and we won an innovation award from the Climate Leadership Conference for our supplier engagement approach."
"To maintain momentum and continue executing against strategy, in 2021 we hired dedicated staff to collaborate with suppliers on emission-reduction opportunities."

"COLLABORATION PROGRAMS To help our suppliers reach or set baselines for their own net-zero goals, we participated in several new programs this year."
"Mastercard joined the Salesforce Net Zero Cloud, as well as the Exponential Roadmap Initiative and related 1.5C Supply Chain Leaders program."
"Our aim is to find ways to collaborate across each of our supply chain sectors, such as creating accounting methodologies for joint projects and mechanisms for tracking multiyear emission reductions."
"We also are investigating opportunities, such as logistics optimization, production sustainability and joint-renewable procurement, in our top three supply chain sectors."
"Additionally, we are deepening our understanding of supply chain activities through carbon accounting analyses within our built environment and those of other suppliers."
"By reducing our suppliers emissions through these programs, we also decarbonize Mastercard."
"In early 2021, we launched a pilot with several Black-owned Mastercard suppliers to provide resources to help them calculate their greenhouse gas emissions in a scientific way."
The suppliers in the program gained a deeper understanding of their current emissions and the opportunities to reduce those emissions over time.
This initiative laid the groundwork for engaging smaller suppliers in emission reductions as we work to substantially decarbonize our supply chain.
Salesforce Net Zero Cloud Ma stercard partnered with Salesforce and Accenture to launch the Salesforce Net Zero Cloud to better track and analyze our supply chain emissions.
We integrated this tool into our decision- making process by identifying top-emitting sectors and suppliers that can potentially collaborate with us.
We plan to expand our Net Zero Cloud usage to include data-tracking and analysis capabilities across all our GHG sectors and suppliers.
"SME Climate Hub Mastercard was one of the 13 original large companies to sign on this year to the 1.5C Supply Chain Leaders , hosted by the Exponential Roadmap Initiative ."
"CDP reporting, which can be an onerous process for large companies, is especially challenging for MSMEs."
The SME Climate Hub enables small and midsize businesses to make internationally recognized climate commitments and provide data.
"This, plus one-stop access to resources, helps them take concrete steps to significantly reduce their emissions."
"CHAPTER 1 HOME CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 3 CHAPTER 5 APPENDIX CHAPTER 4 HOME CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 3 CHAPTER 5 APPENDIX CHAPTER 4 CHAPTER 1 53 EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT Every Mastercard employee plays a critical role in our environmental sustainability commitments, so we engage all of them with activities, educational opportunities and other resources throughout the year."
"In 2021, we launched webinars on our forest restoration work with the Priceless Planet Coalition and an interactive video course to educate employees globally about our 2040 net- zero goal."
"In it, we covered the basics of climate science, carbon accounting and Mastercards SBTs."
The course demonstrates how we plan to meet our targets operationally and how individuals can take action through their own efforts.
Our virtual Earth Day 2021 celebration featured events related to the Priceless Planet Coalition and Mastercards other environmental sustainability commitments.
Employees were encouraged to gift trees to colleagues for recognition.
"New challenges were posted daily containing tips for sustainable habits and practices, and an environmental impact quiz tested employees knowledge of environmentally friendly lifestyles."
"To encourage eco-friendly habits at home, employees were encouraged to submit a pledge via messages, pictures and videos sharing how they can make a difference."

"Waste management El ectronic waste is inevitable in the digital economy, but we ensured that 100 percent of our global e-waste was recycled in 2021 by using responsible partners certified in environmental standards and data destruction to safeguard our customers and the planet."
"With a vaccinated workforce returning to the office globally, we retired most single-use items used for COVID-related health and safety."
"Encouraging the use of reusable cups, mugs and utensils as well as eliminating individually wrapped items in cafeterias greatly reduced our landfill contribution."
"At leased sites, we are exploring innovative products like compostable bioplastics made from crop waste, so we can continue providing safe, high-quality amenities for our employees in an environmentally conscious way."
"Following up on our success in achieving 80 percent waste diversion for all owned sites in 2019, Mastercard raised the bar in 2020 to challenge ourselves to divert at least 85 percent of our material waste from landfills."
"We exceeded this goal in 2021 with 86.1 percent of waste diverted by recycling 705 tons, composting, donations and other forms of diversion."
"86.1% of waste diverted, with 705 tons of recycling, compost, donations and other forms of diversion."

Our senior management also works together to advance our global sustainability efforts across the organization.
"In 2021, we established an ESG Executive Steering Committee comprising leaders from our major business units and support functions (such as sustainability, facilities, enterprise risk management, enterprise resilience, legal, finance and sourcing) to provide greater leadership, coordination and coherence on ESG issues, inclusive of identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities."
Strategy and risk management Preparing for and responding to climate- related risks and opportunities and helping our customers and communities develop the capacity to respond to future changes are key aspects of our business strategy.
"It will take time and considerable strategic thought to ensure that the actions we take today will create a more equitable, sustainable and resilient future for all."
"In 2020, we completed a qualitative scenario analysis to identify potential climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities as our business and people transition to a low-carbon and adaptive economy."
"This analysis included multiple International Energy Agency (IEA) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios and time horizons to evaluate future states, noting that at this point it is not clear which one is the most likely."
"To assess the transition risks and opportunities for our market and business, we used high-, medium- and low-emission scenarios focused on five key regions United States, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia-Pacific across two time horizons, short-term (2025) and medium-term (2040)."
These time horizons roughly align with our GHG targets and consider near term and long term.
"To assess the physical impacts of climate change on certain facilities, including our global and regional headquarters, key data centers and key supplier locations, we evaluated potential threats to business-critical sites under future climate projections based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes (IPCCs) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)."
Risks were analyzed across several time horizons including a future midterm projection (2035) and a future long-term projection (2060).
"This qualitative analysis of 12 sites is part of our broader process to evaluate threats and risk mitigation opportunities across our global operations, supply chain and revenue sources."
Each of the 12 sites was examined by looking at seven potential risks resulting from the physical impacts of climate change.
"The RCP 8.5 scenario was selected because it represents a business-as-usual, worst-case scenario climate emissions trajectory model and provides an upper-boundary condition to support our analysis and risk-management measures."
"This preliminary analysis indicates that we could see increasing risk of chronic climate stressors (increasing temperatures, sea level rise) and acute climate events (flooding, drought, extreme temperatures) at a majority of the sites by 2060."
Such potential risks are not forecasts and are not necessarily indicative of future performance.
"They also do not take into account potential risk-mitigation or adaptation efforts, and assume that such sites continue to operate through the dates specified."
"Current opportunities include sustainable and resilient programs and services, such as the Priceless Planet Coalition ; carbon calculator tools such as ours, which is powered by the Doconomy Aland Index; accelerated digitization of transactions; and resilience services, such as support for disaster needs."
Current transition risks include impacts to travel patterns and inequitable global growth.
"We are using the results of the initial analysis to inform our key functions, including risk, strategy and government engagement."
"Metrics and target We have made several notable commitments to combat climate change, including: Net-zero emissions by 2040 SBTi-approved GHG short-term reduction goals to reduce total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 38% and Scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2025 from a 2016 baseline, which will be modified in 2022 as we work with SBTi to finalize our net-zero 2040 plans RE100 , which reinforces our achievement of procuring 100% renewable electricity Restoration of 100 million trees over 5 years through the Priceless Planet Coalition The integration of Carbon Calculator , a consumer carbon footprint estimating tool launched in collaboration with Doconomy , at the core network level, making all Mastercard transactions eligible for scoring and allowing this functionality to scale more quickly The launch of our Sustainability Innovation Lab, the first of our innovation hubs to focus exclusively on sustainability, built to create products that have a positive environmental impact with strategic Mastercard partners CHAP TER 1 HOM E CHAP TER 2 CHAP TER 3 CHAP TER 5 APPE N D IX CHAP TE R 4 80 APPENDIX HOME CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 3 CHAPTER 5 CHAPTER 4 CHAPTER 1 APPENDIX HOME CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 3 CHAPTER 5 CHAPTER 4 CHAPTER 1 TCFD INDEX CHAP TER 1 HOM E CHAP TER 2 CHAP TER 3 CHAP TER 5 APPE N D IX CHAP TE R 4 81 APPENDIX HOME CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 3 CHAPTER 5 CHAPTER 4 CHAPTER 1 APPENDIX HOME CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 3 CHAPTER 5 CHAPTER 4 CHAPTER 1 TCFD INDEX TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD) INDEX Additionally, in line with TCFDs recommendations, we publicly disclose our climate-related information through our annual CDP Climate Change response."
