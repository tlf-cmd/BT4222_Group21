Introduction Responsible Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix Our Business30 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportOur Products We have long been committed to respecting privacy and security related to the development and use of our products.
"We practice privacy and security by design and our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) processes define actions, deliverables, and checkpoints aimed at integrating security and privacy protections into our products and services."
Intel does not participate in any efforts to decrease security in technology and does not design back doors for access into our products.
The Intel Privacy Notice outlines our general approach to managing personal data.
"In addition, we advocate for global policies and standards to protect privacy and data security."
"As the range of products and services we offer broadens and changes, we evaluate potential concerns about how technology products may be used to infringe on human rights."
"The challenges range from product misuse and limits on freedom of expression, to health and safety concerns that may arise from new technologies."
We updated the Intel Global Human Rights Principles to clarify language regarding our expectations on product responsibility and human rights.
We continuously improve our processes for operationalizing this work.
"Most Intel products are general-purpose computing products that can be incorporated into systems and applications and that are sold to end users by distribu - tors, system manufacturers, and others, and not directly by Intel."
"While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end users may develop, we do not support or tolerate our products being used to violate human rights."
"When we become aware of a concern that Intel products are being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights, we restrict or cease business with the third party until we have high confidence that our products are not being used to violate human rights."
"Salient Human Rights RisksRights holders and relevant potential impacts Intel Employees Intels own global workforce, particularly those undertaking manufacturing activities Supply Chain Workers Labor conditions in raw materials sourcing, manufacturing in high-risk markets, and contract workersEnd Users/Data Subjects Product design considerations and unintended use/misuse of Intels products and servicesCommunity/Society Risks related to third parties, sponsorship partners, and contribution to broader societal changesSalient RisksFreedom from Slavery and of Movement Freedom of Expression Non-discrimination Right to a Clean, Healthy, and Sustainable Environment Right to Decent Work, Rest, and Leisure Right to Humanitarian and Treatment in Armed Conflict Right to Life and Security of Person Right to Peaceful Assembly and Association Right to Privacy The matrix is a high-level mapping of salient human rights risks within our value chain due to external environmental factors."

Responsible AI We can be a role model in our industry by ensuring that our AI development work is consistent with the Intel Global Human Rights Principles and that these principles guide our efforts to build a thriving AI business.
"We have identified and integrated six areas of ethical inquiry into our product development and project approval processes related to AI capabilities: human rights; human oversight; explainable use of AI; security, safety, and reliability; personal privacy; and equity and inclusion."
"In 2021, we evolved our governance policies and processes to guide Intels AI product development and business practices in the face of the ethical issues that may arise with certain AI applications."
"This includes further leveraging our Ethical Principles for AI Development, improving the usability of our Ethical AI impact assessment process, and expanding the resources, tools, and oversight to help project teams engage in meaningful inquiry of risks and mitigation strategies throughout the product lifecycle."
"As a result, we have seen increased participation in this process across all business units."
"We collaborated with Article One a strategy and management consultancy with expertise in human rights, responsible innovation, and social impactto deploy a workshop to educate developers and integrate ethical considerations even more deeply across Intel."
"We also collaborated with Partnership on AI on multiple initiatives, including AI and shared prosperity, responsible sourcing of data enrichment services, and improving inclusion in AI development."
"In addition, we have collaborated in the areas of privacy and security for machine learning with DARPA, the University of Pennsylvania, the Private AI Center , the National Science Foundation, and the Stanford Center for AI Safety."
We continued to leverage and grow our multi-disciplinary cross-Intel Responsible AI Advisory Council.
"The council addresses potential issues such protecting privacy while collecting and using data to train AI systems, reducing the risk of harmful bias in AI systems, and building trust in machine learning applications by helping people to better understand them."

"In 2021, we continued to review ongoing COVID-19 and supply chain challenges through our Supply Chain Command Center."
"Our supplier development, monitoring, and enforcement efforts are integrated across our commodity teams."
"This integration allows us to scale our coverage, support supplier progress, and influence suppliers that may be reluctant to meet our requirements."
"We communicate our expectations in our supplier contracts and request- for-proposal documents, on our supplier website , at meetings and training events, and in annual letters to suppliers ."
"We hold ourselves accountable to meet or exceed the same standards that we set for our suppliers, and audit ourselves to the same protocols."
Every year we complete the RBA Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and publish the results on our corporate website.
We follow the RBA Validated Assessment Program (V AP) to conduct audits of our finished goods factories.
"In 2021, we conducted an RBA V AP audit of our facilities in Kulim, Malaysia and addressed all findings."
"In 2022, we plan to have RBA audits of our facilities in Vietnam and Costa Rica."
"Strengthening Supplier Capabilities For more than a decade, we have worked to help less mature and evolving suppliers build critical sustainability and corporate responsibility acumen, including a focus on compliance with the RBA and our Code of Conduct expectations and requirements."
"We have delivered a broad range of no-cost support options for suppliers, including online resources, interactive training sessions, and connection to external resources such as the RBA and other NGO training and conferences."
Safety Programs.
We set high safety training and performance expectations during our contracting process and orientation for new suppliers.
"We validate that suppliers have robust safety management systems and employee safety training programs in place, and evaluate supplier safety performance for compliance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards, OSHA regulations, and Intels minimum safety requirements."
"In 2021, we partnered with more than 50 suppliers to elevate their safety management systems to ensure safe work practices at Intel sites."
"In addition, we worked with 43 suppliers to close 131 occupational health and safety audit findings and improve worker conditions in their factories."
"Beyond our core capability-building offerings, we have long engaged with supply chain sustainability consul - tants to offer suppliers training and programs focused on topics like work-hours management, occupational health and safety, environmental issues, and prevention of forced and bonded labor."
1 Tier 1 suppliers are companies from which Intel makes direct purchases.
"Among Intels 9,000+ tier 1 suppliers, we identify approximately 400 critical suppliers that we directly engage through our capability-building programs."
These suppliers represent more than75% of our spends.
"Beyond this, we engage with critical tier 2 suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor, responsible minerals, and supplier diversity."

Our sustainability criteria have also been embedded into our supplier quality assessment process to further extend our reach into the supply chain.
"For priority and major findings by category and sub-category, visit the Report Builder ."
"In certain circumstances, the same facility may be audited multiple times in a calendar year."
We treat each individual audit of a single facility as a unique audit in the above table.
"Despite continued challenges due to COVID-19, in 2021, over 157 audits were conducted across 89 suppliers."
Audits that were planned in 2021 but not executed due to COVID-19 restrictions and still deemed necessary are included in our 2022 plan.
"Cumulatively, 627 supplier sites had received audits by the end of 2021."
3 Previous years figures are updated to reflect the most current information as new audit data becomes available.
Supplier Report Card (SRC).
"We have a regular review and scoring process for our SRC to grade suppliers for product availability, cost, quality, sustainability (ethics, supplier diversity, and environmental and human rights performance), security, safety, technology, and customer satisfaction."
"These processes allow for executive-level dialogue on past and future performance, and remind suppliers of our expectations."
Assessments and Audits.
"Supplier assessments and audits cover more than 300 environmental, safety, and human rights factors, and help us determine a suppliers risk profile."
"The audits, conducted by a mix of third parties and Intel personnel, follow the RBA V AP and help us identify where immediate action is needed and where longer term, corrective targeted action plans should be put in place."
"In 2021, 35% of the combined RBA audits were follow-up or closure audits to verify whether the findings from a previous audit had been addressed."
We strive to audit 100% of high-risk supplier sites within a two-year cycle.
"We have instituted a process of unannounced audits to follow up on credible reports of non-compliance, but we did not need to conduct any such audits in 2021.Targeted Action Plans."
"When a supplier does not make sufficient progress in addressing audit findings or has particularly egregious issues, we work with the supplier to quickly develop and implement a strong corrective action plan."
"Supplier progress is reviewed quarterly until we have verified that all key issues have been closed, and that processes have been put in place to prevent recur - rence."
"If satisfactory progress is not made, we may take additional action, such as not awarding new business (conditional use status) until issues are resolved or when necessaryending the supplier relationship."
"While complete closure of some issues can take several years, we work to close egregious issues within 30 days."
We help suppliers with targeted action plans make progress in multiple ways.
"Our actions may include conducting additional reviews, such as unannounced audits, and increasing the frequency of contact between Intel executives and supplier senior management."
"2 We recognize diverse suppliers as businesses that are 51% owned and operated by at least one of the following: women; minorities as defined by the country or region where the business was established; veterans/service-disabled veterans; persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender; or persons who are disabled."
"While Intel recognizes these categories, they may vary in accordance with local law."
"Introduction Responsible Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix Our Business34 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportRecognizing and Rewarding Performance We provide regular feedback to suppliers on their overall progress and achievements, and integrate corporate responsibility considerations into our Excellence, Partnership, Inclusion, and Continuous Improvement (EPIC) program."
"EPIC recognizes suppliers that have demonstrated outstanding, distinguished, and valued performance."
"For more information and a list of recently recognized suppliers, visit our T op 100 Production and Service Suppliers in the Appendix of this report."
"Supplier Environmental Impact We partner with our suppliers to decrease their waste generated, water usage, and greenhouse gas emissions, and thereby reduce our own environmental impact, lower supply chain risk, and can decrease costs."
We also partner with our tier 1 chemical and gas suppliers on green chemistry initiatives.
Our procurement teams work with our logistics and packaging suppliers to drive changes in the materials we use to ship products.
"Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Water Use We decrease the greenhouse gas emissions related to our transportation and logistics network by optimizing packaging to reduce the quantity and weight of ship - ments, and by increasing local sourcing."
Intel is at the forefront of standardizing transportation emissions reporting within the industry through collaboration with organizations such as the Global Logistics Emissions Council .
"In 2021, we asked approximately 116 tier 1 suppliers that have higher environmental impacts to submit data on their own carbon footprints through the CDP Supply Chain Climate Change Questionnaire."
"Of those suppliers, 99% submitted the questionnaire, and 92% of them made their responses public, giving both Intel and other stakeholders information about the environmental performance of our supply chain."
Using information provided in our suppliers CDP Climate Change Questionnaire helps us ensure that we are focusing on the largest climate change impacts.
We also sent the CDP water questionnaire to 52 suppliers that are located in water-stressed regions.
"We achieved a 98% response rate, with 94% of the 52 suppliers publicly sharing their responses."
"As a result of our efforts, we were recognized in the CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard for the fifth consecutive year."
"For more information, see the Sustainable section of this report."
A Risk-Based Approach to Supplier Assessments New Supplier Assessment: A short survey is sent to new suppliers to determine whether a facility is of potential high risk.
We work with suppliers during the on-boarding process to remedy any issues identified.
Self-Assessment: Critical and high-risk suppliers4 complete a questionnaire to determine a facilitys potential gaps to the RBA Code.
"In 2021, we assessed 374 supplier facilities based on this risk assessment and past performance, a 92% increase from 2020."
71% of these assessments were managed through the RBA tools and 29% were managed with Intel-specific tools while using the RBA Code of Conduct as the basis for conformance.
"Audit: Higher risk suppliers must undergo either an on- site audit by qualified third-party auditors who use the RBA V AP , or a qualified Intel auditor."
The latter audits are specialized according to risk and compliance concerns for a particular supplier or facility.
"Lower risk suppliers,5 as determined by the self-assessment, may also be audited at our determination."
What we learn from audits helps inform our supplier engagement and capability- building programs.
"Training/Attestation: In 2021, as part of our progress toward 2030 goals, we began requiring lower risk suppliers to complete training classes through the RBA eLearning Academy."
The curriculum instructed the companies on human rights principles of the RBA Code of Conduct and their obligation to abide by the RBA Code.
79 suppliers completed this curriculum in 2021.
4 Critical suppliers represent a subset of all tier 1 suppliers with which we have significant business relationships and spends.
"High/er risk suppliers refers to suppliers deemed above average risk, based on data and supplier performance."
"5 Lower risk suppliers refers to suppliers deemed below average risk, based on data and supplier performance."

We also began requiring all employees to complete Safety Always training to boost safety awareness across the company.
"In addition, we implemented a new requirement for all non-factory employees to complete Office Ergonomics training to build awareness of office ergonomic risks, proper ergonomic workstation set-up, and ergonomic services available."
"We tracked completion of both classes as a 2021 safety leading indicator, and reported strong performance at 98% and 94%, respectively."
"During 2021, EHS partnered with our Corporate Services and Global Supply Chain organizations to research and recommend chairs and desks for employees working remotely, and provided a portal to enable easy ordering of ergonomically approved equipment worldwide."
"In addition, we developed a one-stop Future of Work ergonomics site to provide easy employee access to all key ergonomic services and reporting information."
"We achieved an EHS training milestone in 2021, with an all- time-high 555,000 EHS training hours completed."
"Introduction Our Business Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix Responsible intel.com/responsibility38 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportRecognizing that early intervention is critical for good ergonomic health and the prevention of injuries, in 2021, we piloted a proactive employee concierge program called Ergo+, which provides employees with one-on-one advice and proactive ergonomic assessments to help address both remote and in-office setups."
Ergo+ includes an easy online tool for employees to sign up for initial consultations and follow-up assessments.
"The pilot resulted in an increase in employee reporting of intermittent discomfort or concerns, and 90% of those surveyed reported that they would recommend the program to a friend."
We plan to expand the program globally in 2022.
We also continued to expand our year-round multimedia Safety Always employee awareness campaign.

Recordable and Days Away Injury RatesIntroduction Our Business Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix Responsible intel.com/responsibility40 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportProtecting Human Rights in the Supply Chain We have continued to focus during the COVID-19 pandemic on ensuring workers in our supply chain are protected from human rights abuses.
"Our 2030 RISE goals reflect our intent to drive human rights despite pandemic, economic, or technological headwinds."
"As such, in 2021, Intel began driving knowledge of and compliance to the RBA Code of Conduct deeper into our supply chain than in previous years."
"Due to supply chain shortages, many companies in the electronics industry have faced severe worker shortages, which has created pressure for longer working hours and fewer days off for workers."
"Intel has continued to press suppliers to abide by the RBA Code of Conduct, including allowing workers a day of rest each week, limiting workers to no more than 60 hours of work per week, and making all overtime voluntary."
"We have worked to build a strong system to detect and address risks of forced and bonded labor among our suppliers and their recruiting and labor agents, including reaching over 135 suppliers at the tier 2 level."
"Our Statement on Combating Modern Slavery details the expectations we have for ourselves and our suppliers, including prohibitions against holding worker passports and charging workers fees to obtain or keep employ - ment."
"Since 2014, our ongoing assessments and efforts to reach deeper into the supply chain have positively affected more than 46,000 workers in our extended supply chain."
"Positive impacts have included the return of over $25 million in fees to more than 21,000 workers by our suppliers since 2014."
"A fee returned could equate to approximately three to five months of base pay, depending on location and situation."
"In some instances, we have faced challenges in gaining cooperation from suppliers in repaying workers quickly; we work closely with suppliers to determine acceptable remedies and put systems in place to prevent such issues in the future."
Findings that May Trigger Forced and Bonded Labor Risks Findings 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Closed 51 46 38 30 17 In Process 2 37 To t a l 51 48 38 30 54 We proactively work to identify and help suppliers close findings that we believe may be trigger factors for forced and bonded labor.
Some historic numbers have been restated due to the timing of reporting.
"Many challenges exist in combating issues related to forced and bonded labor, including lack of full visibility into our complex, changing, multi-tier supply chain."
"T o increase our reach and positive impact, since 2018 we have required that approximately 50 of our suppliers work with at least three of their own major suppliers to assess and address their risks of forced and bonded labor."
"Our suppliers continue to complete all deliverables and demonstrate changes to tier 2 supplier policies and procedures and stronger engagements with recruiting and labor agents, resulting in the return of over $1.2 million in fees to their foreign workers since the start of our program."
"Importantly, our suppliers report benefits as a result of their improved practices, such as reduced business risks, better and larger pools of candidates, a more satisfied workforce, and higher worker retentionall of which can lead to improved productivity and product quality, as well as positive social impacts."
"Introduction Our Business Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix Responsible intel.com/responsibility41 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportIndustry Collaboration through Training Collaboration is key to addressing broad, long-standing issues."
"Intel co-founded and serves on the working group of the multi-industry, multi-stakeholder Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI), which aims to protect and promote the rights of vulnerable workers."
"In partnership with RLI and its members, Intel helped create the Practical Guide to Due Diligence on Recruitment Fees in International Supply Chains , which provides guidelines and examples of best practices to achieve fee repayment."
"The RLI has established the Responsible Recruiting Program, a recruiting agent maturity model."
"In 2021, Intel further sponsored virtual training sessions, Mitigating Risks of Forced Labor and Impacts of COVID-19 on Migrant Workers in the Supply Chain, and will continue to sponsor them in 2022."
"For more information on our work on human rights in our supply chain, see Respecting Human Rights in the Our Business section of this report."
2030 Goal: Supply Chain Human Rights Description.
Scale our supplier responsibility programs to ensure respect for human rights across 100% of our tier 1 contracted suppliers and higher risk tier 2 suppliers.1 Baseline.
"At the beginning of 2020, 18% of our tier 1 contracted suppliers had been assessed and engaged in our supplier responsibility programs."
"By the end of 2020, 8% of our contracted suppliers had completed the requirements of the goal."
Progress in 2021.
"In 2021, we completed initial risk profiles on 100% of tier 1 contracted suppliers, and 28% were determined to be higher risk."
Those higher risk suppliers have been included in the roadmap for follow-up actions according to our risk model.
"Overall, we increased to 24% completion toward our RISE goal, and remain on track to 100% completion by 2030."
"Progress was made in audits for higher risk suppliers, assessments for medium risk suppliers, andfor the first timeRBA training for lower risk suppliers."
Looking Ahead.
"In 2022, our target is to assess, validate, andwhere neededmitigate the risk level of an additional 12% of suppliers."
We are also evaluating the impact of IDM2.0 supply chain changes.
"In addition, we will continue to assess and audit high-risk tier 2 suppliers on Intel sites."
"1 Tier 1 suppliers are companies from which Intel makes direct purchases (approximately 9,000 suppliers)."
Tier 1 contracted suppliers are subject to formal agreements with Intel based on the products and services provided and spends.
Tier 2 suppliers are companies from which Intels tier 1 suppliers make direct purchases.
"Cumulative Progress T owards RISE Goal According to the RBA, the payment of recruitment fees by workers to obtain work is one of the most widespread factors that can contribute to situations of forced labor."
Intel helped create a guide that details best practices for repayment.
"Introduction Our Business Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix Responsible intel.com/responsibility42 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportResponsible Minerals Sourcing Like many companies in the electronics industry, Intel and its suppliers use minerals in manufacturing."
"Over a dozen years ago, Intel began work to responsibly source conflict minerals,1 and in 2017 we expanded our efforts to also address cobalt in our supply chain."
"We are proud of the significant progress we have made as a company and as an industry, but we know that there is more work to be done."
A key technology initiative in our 2030 RISE strategy is to significantly expand our impact in responsible minerals and accelerate the creation of new sourcing standards.
"Intels strategy is to maintain the positive progress weve made to date on 3TG (tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold) and cobalt, and to proactively address emerging risks from the expanding scope of materials and geographies."
Our ambition is to apply our learnings from over a decade and work with our industry to broaden and accelerate the creation of sourcing standards for a much wider set of minerals across additional conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs2).
More information is available on our Responsible Minerals website .
"Our Responsible Minerals program, Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy , and due diligence practices address minerals originating in CAHRAs, and are aligned to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict- Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Guidance)."
"Beyond Conflict Minerals: Driving a Responsibly Sourced Mineral Supply Chain In 2021, we sent our first expanded minerals survey for aluminum, copper, nickel, and silver to suppliers contributing these materials in our Intel-manufactured microprocessors."
"This is an important step in our RISE strategy, as we begin mapping our supply chains for our highest priority minerals."
"Although sourcing of these minerals is not yet widely reported, we received a response from 89% of relevant suppliers."
We are con - tinuing to pursue information on smelters and refiners in our extended supply chainthose that supply our direct suppliers.
A list of smelters and refiners reported can be found on our website.
"T o contribute to standards and help define and engage in due diligence within the copper supply chain, Intel is an active partner member of The Copper Mark , participat - ing in its Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA) T echnical Revision Committee and T echnical Working Group."
"We are continuing to map our supply chain for targeted minerals, as well as other priority minerals such as zinc and lead."
"Additionally, we continue to partner with industry associations to ensure standards are in place to enable our ultimate goal of responsible sourcing for all the minerals in our supply chain."
We will continue to identify the highest priority minerals in pursuit of our 2030 RISE Goals.
Connecting with Mining Communities Intel recognizes the importance of direct engagement with mining communities to address human rights issues in our supply chain.
"As a complement to our due diligence program, we have an ongoing program to dedicate resources and partner with expert civil society organizations to identify and remedy the challenges of the mining communities that source our products."
"A few examples of projects supported by Intel in 2021 are: Congo Power , an alliance providing mining areas with clean power, specifically funding the power needs for community training in addition to the educational programming at the Dr. Mukwege School ; PACT-RMI Youth Vocational Training Program, aimed at providing mining alternatives to Congolese youths; and the development of the worlds first Congo-focused North American collection and repository for Congolese- written documents on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), at the University of British Columbia library."
We believe that helping to empower marginalized workers in our supply chain is a crucial step in promoting human rights.
Intel also recognizes the local socio-economic impor - tance of the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector in CAHRAs and seeks to assist ASM sites in meeting downstream compliance requirements through the Better Mining ASM Mine Monitoring Program in partnership with Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and RCS Global .
"Intel also supported a digital suite designed specifically for the ASM sector, which will create new pathways to track, access, and share data about practices in mining communities."
Maintaining a connection and providing support to the communities that we depend on in our vast global supply chain is a crucial component to our responsible minerals program.
"Introduction Our Business Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix Responsible intel.com/responsibility43 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportOur Due Diligence Continues: 3TG and Cobalt Intels responsible 3TG and cobalt program, aligned with the OECD Guidance , focuses on three primary areas: Risk Identification."
"Each year we conduct a supply chain survey to identify the smelters and refiners that process the 3TG and cobalt contained in the products supplied to Intel, and the country of origin of minerals used."
We then compare those smelters and refiners to the list of facilities that conform to a responsible minerals sourcing validation program such as RMIs Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP).
We use the information to identify potential mineral supply chain risks.
Risk Mitigation.
"When we identify potential risks, we conduct further due diligence, which may include on-site smelter or refinery visits or virtual outreach."
"Such visits or virtual outreach help identify risks, encourage smelters and refiners to participate in an audit program to validate their sourcing practices, and drive risk mitigation for human rights impacts."
"When necessary, we will disen - gage from mineral supply chains that cannot uphold our responsible minerals sourcing standards."
"Additionally, we have increased virtual outreach to smelters and refiners already participating in a third-party audit program to ensure participation continuity, minimize disruption, and provide additional support throughout the pandemic."
Supporting In-Region Sourcing.
We believe that the creation and support of responsibly sourced3 minerals from CAHRAs improve the lives of the people in the regions.
"In addition to our independent project resourcing, our membership in and support of the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA) and European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM) directly support regional projects that enable responsibly sourced minerals from CAHRAs by helping to implement programs that are consistent with the OECD Guidance and supported RMI programs."
"Intel is also a member of the International Tin Associations International Tin Supply Chain Initiative (iTSCi), a trace - ability program to help ensure traceability of responsibly mined minerals from mine to smelter."
"1 Conflict minerals, as defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is a broad term that means tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG), regardless of whether these minerals finance conflict in the DRC or adjoining countries."
"2 CAHRAs, as defined by OECD, are identified by the presence of armed conflict, widespread violence, or other risks of harm to people."
"Armed conflict may take a variety of forms, such as a conflict of international or non-international character, which may involve two or more states, or may consist of wars of liberation, or insurgencies, civil wars, etc."
"High-risk areas may include areas of political instability or repression, institutional weakness, insecurity, collapse of civil infrastructure, and widespread violence."
Such areas are often characterized by widespread human rights abuses and violations of national or international law.
"3 Responsibly sourced refers to products from suppliers, supply chains, smelters, and refiners that, based on our due diligence, are in line with current global standards and respect human rights in every aspect of their practice."
3TG.
"Through our annual supply chain survey process, in 2021, 99% of the relevant suppliers and refiners reported in our supply chain are deemed responsibly sourced through their conformance to and/or participa - tion in a responsible minerals assurance program."
Cobalt.
Intel used the RMI Cobalt Response T emplate (CRT) to survey all suppliers contributing cobalt to our products.
"In 2021, we received responses from 100% of suppliers surveyed."
"Intel conducted risk mitigation in our supply chain, including smelter outreach and country of origin assessments, as well as working with direct suppliers to facilitate alternative sourcing where appropriate."
Our goal is to responsibly source all cobalt in our products.
"Through RMIs cobalt working group and smelter outreach, we are pursuing all smelters and refiners in our cobalt supply chain to participate in RMAP."
See a complete list of facilities that processed cobalt in Intels supply chain based on supplier responses to our 2021 survey.
"Intel s long-term leadership in initiatives such as the RMI and PPA allows us to regularly collaborate on the issue of responsible minerals sourcing with other companies, industries, governments, and civil society."
Such collabo - ration is crucial to identify and address risks associated with mineral extraction and trade in complex mineral supply chains.
"All participants, from the mines through device manufacturers, have a responsibility to ensure that they do not contribute to human rights abuses."
"We continue to advance responsible sourcing across our product lines, materials, and industry as our business and the world landscape evolve."
Our annual conflict minerals disclosure filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission contains additional information about our 3TG and cobalt due diligence practices.
Introduction Our Business Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix Responsible intel.com/responsibility44 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportResponsible Mobility The United Nations General Assembly set an ambitious target of 50% reduction in global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2030.
"According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes."
"More than half of all road traffic deaths are among vulnerable road userspedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.1 Autonomous vehicle (A V) technology has the potential to improve road safety, save lives, and transform personal mobility, including bringing broader mobility to the elderly and those with disabilities."
Intel s Mobileye business is a global leader in driving assistance and self-driving solutions.
"The company s product portfolio employs a broad set of technologies covering computer vision and machine learning-based sensing, data analysis, localization, mapping, and driving policy technology for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and A Vs. Mobileye technology helps keep the drivers and passengers of more than 100 million vehicles safer today."
"One of Intel s 2030 RISE technology industry initiatives is to collaborate with industry, ecosystem partners, and governments to advance the adoption of technology- neutral safety standards to advance the A V industry in pursuit of reduced traffic accidents globally."
"We will achieve this through the standardization of Intel s Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) safety model to enable safe, commercial deployment of A Vs at scale, anywhere in the world, via self-driving Mobility-as-a- Service (MaaS)."
"Introduced in 2017, RSS is a formal model for safety based on human concepts of what it means to drive safely."
RSS enables efficient validation of the safety of an A V providing strong assurances to the public of the safety of A Vs. RSS formalizes human decision making for safe driving and is based on the need to balance safety with useful driving by making reasonable worst- case assumptions about other road users.
RSS is a technology-neutral approach to A V safety and provides regulators around the world a transparent way to evaluate the performance of driverless vehicles.
RSS has become a leading model for global A V safety frameworks.
Numerous standards bodies are beginning to include RSS in their standards development activities.
Regulators and policymakers are looking at RSS as a tool for defining what it means for an A V to drive safely.
Researchers are digging into the application of RSS and pushing the boundaries of its efficacy.
"Standards progress has been especially robust, as RSS has been contributed to both IEEE and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards efforts."
"Intel leads an IEEE working group to develop an open, transparent, and technology-neutral formal model for safety."
"The first project from this working group, known as IEEE 2846: Assumptions for Models in Safety-Related Automated Vehicle Behavior , defines reasonably foreseeable assumptions that an A V safety model shall consider about other road users when operating in the real world."
"The working group includes other industry representatives from Waymo, Uber, FCA, Ford, Motional, Nvidia, and more."
"Additionally, ISO has adopted the Safety First for Automated Driving paper as a technical report, and it is now being improved to a T echnical Standard."
"This paper was published by Intel and 10 other automotive industry representatives (BMW, Daimler, VW, and more), and includes RSS in the Drive Planning Element that supports a capability to create a collision-free and lawful driving plan."
"China ITS, the standards body for the worlds largest passenger vehicle market, has released an A V standard based on RSS."
Intel has also presented and contributed RSS to regulatory standards efforts at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
"Other standards organizations, businesses, and think tanks are evaluating and/or using RSS, including SAE- ITC s Automated Vehicle Safety Consortium, Baidu, Valeo, the RAND Corporation, and Arizona s Institute of Automated Mobility."
"Intel is also working to educate policymakers on the critical importance of policy actions and regulation to advance the adoption of transparent and open A V safety standards in efforts like National Highway Traffic Safety Administration s Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Framework for Automated Driving System Safety."
"Mobileye recently introduced the EyeQ Ultra, the companys most advanced, highest performing system-on-chip (SoC) purpose-built for autonomous driving."
"EyeQ Ultra maximizes both effectiveness and efficiency, making it the industrys leanest autonomous vehicle (A V) chip."
"This efficiently designed SoC builds on seven generations of proven EyeQ architecture to deliver exactly the power and performance needed for A Vs, which are all but certain to be all-electric vehicles."
"The first silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC is expected at the end of 2023, with full automotive-grade production in 2025."

Transparency and open sharing of our data enables us to both celebrate progress and identify key areas for action and improvement.
In 2021 we continued our focus on career development and progression of diverse talent.
We saw absolute numbers increase in all categories.
"Some of the numbers from 2020 to 2021 did not increase much as percentages orin some cases decreased, because of the unprecedented growth in our company."
"For example, the percentage of Intel employees who identify as veterans dropped slightly, from 7.3% in 2020 to 7.2% in 2021, yet the number of employees who identify as veteransincreased by roughly 150."

Introduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling AppendixIntroduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling Appendix InclusiveInclusive50 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility Report Raising the Bar Intels ambitious goals are designed to continue to raise the bar for ourselves and the industry to deliver greater value through corporate responsibility excellence.
"We will achieve those goals by strengthening our systems, processes, and programs to drive diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility throughout our workforce."
T o the right are descriptions of two of our workforce inclusion goals and progress we made in 2021.Read about our other 2030 inclusion goals in Accessibility and Disability Inclusion and Supplier Diversity and Inclusion .
2030 Goal: Representation in Senior Leadership Description.
Double the number of women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) in senior leadership roles.
Baseline.
"1,250 women and 380 URMs in senior leadership roles as of April 30, 2020.5T arget for 2030 is to reach 2,500 women and 760 URMs in senior leadership."
Progress in 2021.
"During 2021 we surpassed by 74 our milestone goal of reaching 1,375 women in leadership roles, ending the year with 1,449 women in senior leadership roles across the globe."
The above-and-beyond results in 2021 set us up to continue making progress in women in senior leadership.
"Although the absolute number of women leaders increased, given the overall growth of the company, relative representation of women leaders decreased 0.1 percentage points."
"Our US URM senior leaders also increased, from 384 to 444."
"For 2021, we established a mile - stone goal to increase representation by 10% of Black/African American employees in senior, director, and executive roles in our US population."
"We exceeded this milestone, increasing representation by 11%."
Looking Ahead.
We are on track to achieve our 2030 goal.
We acknowledge the opportunity to leverage the companys growth and IDM 2.0 strategy to further progress the representation of women and URMs in our workforce.
2030 Goal: Women in T echnical Positions Description.
Exceed 40% representation of women in technical positions.
Baseline.
"24.9% of technical roles held by women globally as of April 30, 2020.5 Progress in 2021."
"At the end of 2021, 24.3% of technical roles were held by women, a decrease from 25.2% at the end of 2020, despite the company having grown its technical headcount by 8.8%."
Looking Ahead.
"T o meet our goal of increasing representation of women in technical roles to 40%, we will be implementing targeted programs to increase the number of women hired for technician, engineering hardware and software roles through sourcing, pipelining and workforce development initiatives."
"T o drive additional corporate level focus we have made this anAnnual Performance Bonus goal for all employees in 2022.In addition, we set a goal that our hiring for technical entry-level roles is at least 30% women."
5 We selected the April 30 baseline to align with the completion of our annual performance review process and promotion cycle.
"Introduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling AppendixIntroduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling Appendix InclusiveInclusive51 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportPay Equity At Intel, we strive for an inclusive and fully engaged workforce that is reflective of the best and brightest talent in our industry."
"Since 2019, we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US."
"We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at grade level, and tenure."
Intels legal and human resources teams work with third-party experts using proven statistical modeling techniques to monitor and advance global pay equity.
"Our comprehensive analysis includes base pay, bonuses, and stock grants."
Individual employees who are identified as having a gap through this analysis receive appropriate adjustments.
"A key component of our pay equity strategy is our commitment to transparency, which helps us to hold ourselves accountable and encourage action by others."
"In support of this goal, we first publicly released our EEO-1 survey pay data in 2019, we feel it is important to continue collecting and disclosing diversity and inclusion data publicly."
Inclusive Culture Inclusion is one of Intels core values and it is at the heart of our culture.
"We have taken actions to integrate our inclusion expectations into our policies, performance management systems, leadership expectations, annual bonus metrics, and employee surveys."
The Intel Code of Conduct and Intel Global Human Rights Principles set out our commitment to nondis - crimination and to provide a workplace free of harassment.
"We have redesigned our employee performance management system and leadership promotions process to focus on results delivered, as well as how those results are achieved through alignment with Intels values and commitment to inclusion."
Inclusion@Intel.
The global Inclusion@Intel portal provides a community for employees and empowers them to build tangible and actionable inclusive practices into their everyday work environment.
"This unique plat - form provides highlights on inclusive leaders, inclusion training, sharing of best practices, videos, podcasts, and scenario cards that can be used to encourage critical conversations."
"Our Inclusive Leaders program is designed to equip managers to play leadership roles in growing Intel's inclusive culture and fostering leadership skills needed to build diverse and inclusive, high-performing teams."
"In 2021, we expanded the programacross Intel worldwide via workshops and small-cohort-based learning."
"Employees completed over 4,000 individual learning modules in 2021."
"For further impact, we also integrated the inclusion content into new Manager Academy training and began rolling it out to our 13,000 managers worldwide in 2021."
Inclusive Hiring Practices.
We have developed a set of best practices and training to mitigate the influence of unconscious bias in the hiring process.
"These practices include posting of formal requisitions for internal positions, using impartial descriptions of qualifications for all open jobs, and having diverse slates of candidates and diverse hiring panels."
"In 2021, we also required inclusive hiring training for all of our hiring managers."
"Linking Compensation to Diversity and Inclusion Goals Since 2008, we have linked a portion of our executive and employee compensation to corporate responsibility metrics, including diversity and inclusion metrics."
"In 2021, we met these metrics, which focused on the 2030 workforce goal milestones of reaching 1,375 women in senior leadership roles globally and increasing by 10% the representation of Black/African American employees in senior, director, and executive level roles in our US workforce."
"In 2022, the goals related to inclusion include: increasing by another 10% the representation of Black/African American employees in senior, director, and executive level roles in our US workforce; women representing 30% of technical entry-level hires; and $1.4 billion in annual spending with diverse suppliers."
"For more information, see our 2022 Proxy Statement , Supplier Diversity and Inclusion later in this section of the report, and the Sustainable section of this report."
"Introduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling AppendixIntroduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling Appendix InclusiveInclusive52 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportLeadership Councils and Employee Resource Groups We offer close to 40 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and seven Leadership Councils that connected over 25,000 employees in 2021."
Some 21% of our employees are members of ERGs.
Leadership Councils.
"Our Leadership Councils, composed of over 400 Intel leaders, help guide and mentor members of the ERGs."
Their mission is to promote the progression and growth of diverse employ - ees and foster an inclusive culture where all employees can thrive professionally.
"The Intel Black Leadership Council, Intel Disability Leadership Council, Intel Latinx Leadership Council, Intel Native American and Pacific Islander Leadership Council, Intel Network of Executive Women, Intel Veteran Leadership Council, and Out and Ally Leadership Council host sponsorship programs to help support and advance leaders within their respective communities, while driving business results."
"Leadership Councils are composed of Intel Senior Leadership, with membership usually starting at the director or principal engineer level."
Each council is supported by a sponsor at the executive or senior vice-president level.
ERGs.
"Intel has ERGs organized around race, national origin, sexual orientation and gender identity, parent - hood, disabilities, education, faith and beliefs, and other common affinities."
"ERGs can serve as powerful networks, offering opportunities for personal and profes - sional development, access to mentors, and volunteer activities that facilitate teamwork and build camaraderie."
We encourage employees to participate in ERGs beyond their personal affinities to build relationships with a wider community and exchange learnings.
We believe that retention rates increase when people feel included in deep and wide-ranging networks.
"We chartered a new ERG in 2021, Partners for Inclusion and Equity, which provides a forum for ongoing, safe, and open conversations about the impacts of racism."
Membership in this new ERG grew to nearly 400 in under a year.
"Intels Cross-Faith and Beliefs ERG Leaders Alliance, made up of seven belief-based ERGs, received the Above and Beyond Award in the Culture Impact cat - egory from Seramount, a leading force in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the corporate market."
"In addition, Intel placed #1 on the Fortune 100 Corporate Religious Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Index 2021."
Intel Employee Resource Groups Our ERGs are part of the engine that drives community and inclusion at Intel.
The vast variety of these groups reflects how Intel tries to include and empower every employee to embrace a sense of belonging.

"Through our regular Employee Experience Surveys , employees can voice their percep - tions of the company and their work experience, including their views on our diversity and inclusion performance and culture."
"In 2021, 90% of employees reported, I am treated with dignity and respect at work and Intel makes it easy for people from diverse backgrounds to fit in and be accepted, an increase in favorable responses year over year."
"We also created the Employee Inclusion Survey to develop deeper understanding of how Introduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling AppendixIntroduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling Appendix InclusiveInclusive53 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility Reportdifferent employee populations experience inclusion at Intel, identify opportunities for improvement, and better understand root causes of any systemic issues and how to address them."
"Employees from 30 countries were invited to participate and over 27,000 responded."
We shared results with employees and enabled them to ask questions about actions.
The table below shows the percent favorable (Strongly Agree or Agree with the statement) as scored by different demographic groups.
"Despite these high-level results, the wide range of experiences reported by different demographic groups indicates that Intel has room for improvement in inclusion for some populations."
This data will help guide our continued efforts in driving an inclusive culture.

"IGLOBE, our LGBT+ ERG, expanded to 17 chapters, with new chapters in Poland, Germany, the Netherlands, and China."
"IGLOBE is guided by the Out and Ally Leadership Council (OALC) of senior leaders who promote visibility and focus on progression of LGBT+ employees and expansion of allyship through education, mentoring, and advocacy."
"In 2021, participation in the LGBT+ mentor program increased by 35%."
"Since 2002, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) has listed Intel on its Corporate Equality Index (CEI), awarding Intel the top score of 100 in 17 of those years."
"The CEI recognizes employers that take steps to ensure greater equality for LGBT+ workers and their families in the form of policies, benefits, and practices."
"Intel Guadalajara also earned 100 points and received HRC Equidae MX Certification, awarded to companies in Mexico committed to providing LGBT+ inclusion."
"In our 2021 Employee Inclusion Survey (EIS), our LBGT+ employees reported strong favorable results in some areas, but also indicated that we have more work to do in psychological safety."
"Less than half of LGBT+ respondents said they had a positive experience in being open about their sexual orientation and gender identity, and have visible role models."
"The data allowed us to explore the dynamics of different identity groups for the first time; for example, the transgender community had a high belonging score (90% favorable), while our non-binary colleagues had one of the lowest scores related to visible role models (39% favorable)."
"As part of the EIS, 5.1% of our employees that responded to the survey shared that they are a member of the LGBT+ community, but only one in three of those who responded to the survey has self-IDed in our human resources system (available in several countries)."
"We have made progress educating employees on the importance of self-IDing, and in 2022, we plan to expand our self-ID capability to additional countries."
"We will also con - tinue to focus on retention and progression through our mentor program, OALC speaker series, and other initiatives driven by OALC and IGLOBE."
Introduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling AppendixIntroduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling Appendix InclusiveInclusive54 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportAccessibility and Disability Inclusion We strive to become a global employer of choice for people with disabilities and those caring for family members with disabilities.
"According to the World Health Organization, 15% of the worlds population (over 1 billion people) have some form of disability and it is estimated that 70% of disabilities are invisible.6 In 2021, we launched the new Intel name sign, a critical component of disability inclusion and support of the Deaf community."
The Intel Corporate Accessibility Policy outlines our commitment to a culture of accessibility and broader impact through our technology.
"Through our three-pillar strategy, we focus on advancing accessibility through our workplace, products, and industry."
"We focus on advancing accessible design and innovative technology solutions, physical and digital accessibility in the work - place, integration of accessibility best practices in our culture, use of accessible hiring and employee practices, and external engagement and collaboration."
The Intel Disability and Accessibility Network (IDAN) has a presence at 12 of our sites worldwide and is sup - ported by the Intel Disability Leadership Council.
"These groups advocate for and work to advance and retain our disability community, while amplifying awareness both internally and externally."
The team has also advanced a plan to ensure that employees who are caring for a family member are supported.
"In 2021, Disability:IN recognized IDAN as Employee Resource Group of the Year for exemplary programming and practices for employees."
IDAN also received internal recognition as Intels ERG of the year through our Global Diversity and Inclusion Achievement Awards.
"In 2021, for the fifth year in a row, Disability:IN gave Intel the maximum score of 100 in the Disability Equality Index (DEI), and named Intel one of the Best Places to Work for People with Disabilities."
"The DEI, a joint initiative withthe American Association of People with Disabilities, is a comprehensive benchmarking tool that provides an objective score and roadmap on disability inclusion policies and practices."
"In early 2021, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger signed the CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion to commit to benchmarking our disability inclusion journey with the DEI, and Intel also joined The Valuable 500 , a global CEO community focused on advancing disability inclusion through business leadership."
"In 2021, we continued employee training on how to create accessible communications materials, meetings, and events."
"We delivered accessibility training to over 1,500 employees and also added captioning to Intel Developer Zone videos to further support accessibility for our developer community."
2030 Goal: Accessibility and Disability Inclusion Description.
Advance accessibility and increase the percentage of employees who self-identified as having a disability to 10% of our workforce by 2030.
Baseline.
1.4% of Intels US workforce self-identified as having a disability as of December 2020.
Progress in 2021.
3.8% of Intels US workforce self-identified as having a disability as of December 2021.
"2021 was a year of laying the groundwork for us to begin preparing for the global expansion of our self-identification process, and to develop our maturity model and scaling roadmap to fully embed accessibility into our culture and processes globally."
Looking Ahead.
"In 2022, we are continuing to assess systems, processes, and resources to prioritize a multi-year execution plan."

"Accessible Product Design Accessible technology allows people to acquire education, have a career, use government services, make purchases, pursue hobbies, and much more."
Access to information and communications technologies is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities .
"As part of our Inclusive Global Challenges, our goal is to ensure that every client computing platform we produce expands accessibility for more people than the platform before, with experiences designed in collaboration with people with disabilities."
"By 2030, all Intel user experience teams will have adopted inclusive design and research processes with relevant operational research support."
"In 2021, we hired a full-time inclusive design operations program manager, and we have adopted an Accessibility Maturity Model to chart our progress toward our 2030 goals."
We have also created new matrixed ways of elevating accessibility across our product design segments.
"Our work has resulted in new assistive technologies that use indoor navigation, assistive speech, and 3-D printing."

Introduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling AppendixIntroduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling Appendix InclusiveInclusive55 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportInclusion for Everyone We recognize and respect the worth and dignity of every employee and want everyone to contribute at their full potential.
"We promote and sustain a sense of belonging for everyone, but have identified areas where we need to do better."
"First, we recognized that some of our diversity and inclusion efforts have been more US focused, even though Intel is a global company."
We have adjusted by ensuring that global goals are a significant part of our 2030 RISE strategy and by integrating all regions even more in our processes.
We identified our factory workers as another group we could better engage.
We are launching a program to increase engagement with our factory workers and provide alternative ways of engagement for all.
We also recognized that some communities have felt excluded from our diversity and inclusion efforts.
Our efforts have been focused on equity of opportunity and changes in culture that should benefit everyone.
We have taken steps to make it more explicit that we want to include everyone in our efforts.
"In 2021, a group of men and women from Intel business groups around the globe organized Intels International Mens Day to celebrate mens positive contributions to society, promote positive male role models, and focus on mens health and well-being."
"The event included partnerships with several Intel ERGs, as well as external organizations such as Movember and the Better Man Conference."
"The celebration attracted more than 1,000 attendees, and included 24 speakers from nine countries."
"Hiring, Retention, and Progression We have developed a set of programs and initiatives to support inclusive hiring, retention, and progression practices."
Diversity and inclusion start from the moment we identify candidates and try to fill roles with the best available talent.
"Inclusive hiring practices include, in part, ensuring that we have a pool of diverse candidates."
We have invested in programs that enable us to reach underrepresented candidates and give them equal opportunities to compete for jobs.
"Through the Intel Scholars Program, we engage with internal business units, Intel leaders, and 15 external partners to support underrepresented students pursuing degrees in STEM fields."
"The program includes financial scholarships, exposure to Intel jobs, mentors, networking, research insights, and training opportunities."
We supported 354 scholars in 2021 through our scholarship programs.
"In 2016, we launched our confidential retention Warmline service, and in 2021 extended real-time Warmline support and guidance at scale for our global workforce."
"The Warmline provides employees with guidance through challenges in areas such as career progression, belonging/integration, job skills alignment, and employee-manager connection."
"In addition to supporting employees before they consider leaving Intel, the Warmline provides a robust data set to help us identify patterns, locate problem areas, and address issues proactively and systemically."
Some 83% of employees who used the Warmline service in 2021 have stayed at Intel and 99% would recommend it to others.
"In 2021, we also, launched the Executive Warmline to better serve executives with internal transition and navigational support."
"Of the executives who used the Executive Warmline since its launch, 69% have stayed at Intel."
We have also been piloting new programs to support retention and promotion.
"The first pilot, for senior-level women across the globe, aims to increase promotion and development opportunities and improve job satisfaction and retention through leadership and sponsor/protege matching."
"In 2021, 95 women participated in the pilot, and we aim to scale it further in 2022."
"A second pilot, T alent Keepers, aims to engage mid- level Black and African American employees in the US and Costa Rica more directly with their managers in career development and progression discussions and initiatives."
"A total of 124 pairs of employees and managers completed the program in 2021, and we expect to add 300 more participants in 2022."
"Introduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling AppendixIntroduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling Appendix InclusiveInclusive56 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportSocial Equity Intel is committed to a culture of inclusion for all, and we recognize our shared responsibility to combat the structural inequalities impacting our employees and communities."
We acknowledge accelerating equity is critical to successfully creating a culture of inclusion and belonging.
"At Intel, social equity is an extension of our Global Human Rights Principles and means creating a world in which all people, regardless of their identity or background, have equal voice, representation, and access to opportunities."
"In 2020, Intel established the Social Equity Program Office chartered to leverage data to address inequality and drive equitable change inside Intel, in our communities, and across broader society."
"We launched enterprise-wide sprint teams at all levels across our Human Resources and business organiza - tions, and defined tangible social equity goals to accelerate our 2030 RISE Strategy."
"Our social equity strategy includes programs, resources, investments, and policy advocacy to remove systemic barriers to a fully inclusive workplace and society."
Intels Global Social Equity Policy Principles guide our work with governments and organizations to build a more equitable world.
"In 2021, we focused on creating measurable progress across four key areas: people, philanthropy, products, and policy."
People: Action from the Inside Out Our social equity strategy begins with leveraging capabilities across Intel to drive equitable change from the inside out.
"Working toward our 2030 goals, we are taking action to accelerate US representation of African American employees at senior, executive, and director levels by 30% by the end of 2023."
We achieved an 11% increase in 2021 and have set a mile - stone goal to achieve another 10% in 2022.
Setting interim milestones ensures sustained progress as we further integrate equity into our systems and practices to close persistent gaps in African American and other inclusive leadership representation goals.
Driving equity also requires personal transformation and action.
Intel leaders continue to hold listening sessions to learn from lived experiences of employees.
We also provide learning and engagement pathways for our employees and managers.
"Our Social Equity Speaker Series, an inclusive forum with expert external speakers, provides safe and supportive platforms for developing shared language and deeper learning from diverse perspectives."
Philanthropy: Catalyzing Change Intel and the Intel Foundation are catalyzing change through strategic engagements and community partnerships.
"Recognizing that some issues of inequality are deeply embedded throughout society, Intel estab - lished multi-year investments with several organizations at the forefront of advancing social justice and anti- racism at scale around the world."
"The organizations were selected based on input from our Network of Intel African Ancestry and the Intel Black Leadership Council and focus on critical areas including equitable justice, digital equity, education equity, and economic equity."
"Intel, the Intel Foundation, and employees donated $600,000 through donation matching campaigns that supported social equity and justice causes globally in 2021."
Intel and the Intel Foundation support community programs that place equity and access at the center of their offerings.
"For example, the Equity in STEAM initiative a partnership with YWCA Metropolitan Phoenixis designed to address the systemic barriers preventing women and people of color from pursuing careers in STEAM."
"In early 2022, the initiative announced funding grants and a leadership cohort for 20 Arizona educators and nonprofits ."
Products: Advancing Equity Through T echnology Solutions We continue to leverage Intels expertise to unleash the power of data and technology to advance social equity.
"Collaborating with others, our data scientists and engineers are researching more inclusive, accessible designs for future products."
Our teams are also working to prevent algorithmic bias as part of our focus on responsible AI practices and the development of inclusive coding language.
"Through the Intel RISE T echnology Initiative (IRTI), our employees submit their ideas for technology projects in collaboration with Intel customers to positively impact social equity and human rights."
"In 2021, more than $1.4 million was directed to support innovative global projects at the intersection of human rights and social equity to expand access and opportunity for healthcare, digital inclusion, and economic and food security."
"Policy: Advocating for Social Justice Intel advocates for programs, public policy, and legislative solutions that combat systemic inequity."
"In early 2021, we pledged $5 million to North Carolina Central University, a historically Black college or university (HBCU), to create the first T ech Law and Policy Center."
"Today, only 5% of US attorneys are Black, even though more than 13% of the US population is Black."
HBCUs are key to producing the next generation of legal and policymakers who will lead the charge to eradicate systemic and structural inequities.
Intel also introduced expungement clinics to further our commitment to social equity.
"Introduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling AppendixIntroduction Our Business Responsible Sustainable Enabling Appendix InclusiveInclusive57 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility Report Social Equity and Racial Justice Collaborations Intel has provided both financial and in-kind support to organizations working to advance economic equity, education equity, and equitable justice and anti-racism innovations at scale."

Looking Ahead.
We will continue to explore additional locations to increase renewable electricity.
"For more than a decade, Intel has been one of the top voluntary corporate purchasers of green power in the US EPAs Green Power Partnership (GPP) program."
"In addition to generating on-site and off-site renewable electricity and purchasing renewable electricity from our utility suppliers, we purchase green attributes from multiple sources of generation."
"These include wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal, which are certified and verified by nonprofit validation accreditors such as the Center for Resource Solutions Green-e program to meet GPP program requirements."
Our approach to renewable and alternative electricity investments has been to reduce our own carbon foot - print while encouraging others to take similar actions.
"We are encouraged by actions we have seen over the past decadeby companies, investors, utilities, and governmentsto increase commitments and invest - ments in renewable energy supplies and apply new technologies."
Introduction Our Business Responsible Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix71 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportProduct Energy Efficiency Each new generation of products offers higher perfor - mance and improved energy efficiency compared to previous generations.
"Building energy efficiency into our products not only reduces our Scope 3 GHG emissions, but also presents an opportunity to create value for our customers by helping them lower their Scope 2 GHG emissions, energy use, and overall environmental impact."
"In 2021, we launched 12th Generation Intel Core pro - cessors for desktop and notebook computers, with hybrid architecture comprising performance cores and efficient cores."
"Performance boost1 with hybrid technology will lead to higher performance per watt in client products, helping us meet our 2030 10X product efficiency goals."
"During 2021, we continued our work on energy-efficiency initiatives and have made substantial progress in replacing traditional system sleep and idle states with Modern Standby."
Intel maintained 100% adoption of Modern Standby on notebook PC designs using 12th Generation Intel Core processors (ADL-P and ADL-U).
The transition of desktop PCs to Modern Standby ramped in 2021 with a doubling of design wins through ecosystem partnerships.
Intel collaborated with the technology industry to enable customers to successfully transition to Tier-2 specifications of California Energy Commission (CEC) computers standard (approximately 15% annual PC energy use reduction).
We also worked with industry partners and the Consumer T echnology Association to influence US computer and display standards to align with the existing CEC standards and future CEC revi - sions.
This alignment is critical to prevent a patchwork of state-level certification requirements.
"Working with the European Commission and other stakeholders on EU Lot 3 Computers regulation revision, Intel continued to make progress with DIGIT ALEUROPE on new software tools for PC active mode energy-efficiency labeling recom - mendations."
We also worked with government policy makers In South Korea to influence the direction of the new version of computer standard.
"For server energy efficiency, Intel collaborated with technology industry consortia and European Standard - ization Organizations to support development of new harmonized standards in support of EU Lot 9 server regulation already in effect."
We also contributed to server energy-efficiency standards initiatives in the UK and India.
"In China, as part of industry consortia we are working with China National Institute of Standardization to agree on a workable solution for SPEC SERT suite and Chinas indigenous benchmark tool (BenchSEE) to co-exist, in order to comply with Chinas upcoming server energy- efficiency standard."
We have estimated the GHG emissions due to energy consumption by Intel processors sold in 2021.
"The annual and lifetime emissions of Intel processors when used in customers compute applications (i.e., server, desktop, notebook, and workstation) equate to approximately 5,264,000 and 22,903,000 metric tons of CO2e, respectively."
The decrease in annual and lifetime emissions compared with 2020 is driven primarily by significant improvements in our server CPU calculation methodology for product energy usage and associated GHG emissions.
Refine - ments for 2021 included incorporating both enterprise and cloud data center models.
"While there was no change to traditional enterprise data center methodology, the cloud data center model required significant refinement to CPU percent average active power in line with CPU usages in todays data centers."
Further refinements for 2021 included accounting for the emissions reduction impacts of the use of renewable electricity by our cust- omers.
"Specifically, calculations included consideration of cloud service provider publicly reported use of renewable electricity in data centers."
Yearly emissions due to energy consumption of Intel processors are expected to trend downwards as our customers further adopt renewable electricity initiatives and goals.
"Net lifetime emissions after accounting for renewable electricity is going down, even with higher percent average active power in cloud data centers."
"For more information, see Achieving Carbon Neutral Computing later in this section.2030 Goal: Product Energy Efficiency Description."
Increase product energy efficiency 10X for Intel client and server microprocessors to reduce our Scope 3 emissions.

"By responsibly managing our water use, guided by our Global Water Policy , we can meet our business needs, as well as those of our communities."
"In 2021, we returned and restored approximately 99%1 (by volume) of our fresh water withdrawals to our communities through efficient water management, water reuse, and project funding that enabled water restoration in local watersheds."
"Our water strategy has three main objectives: conserve water used in our operations, collaborate on water ini - tiatives with local communities, and create technology solutions to help others reinvent how they use and conserve water."
"As a part of our 2030 RISE goals, we aim to achieve net positive water by conserving 60 billion gallons of water (cumulative from 2020) and funding water projects that will restore more fresh water than we consume to our local watersheds."
We estimate that our water conservation efforts saved approximately 9.3 billion gallons of water in 2021.
"We also completed new projects in 2021 that we estimate will save more than 1.6 billion gallons annually, once operational."
"Over the last 10 years, our water conserva - tion efforts have saved approximately 44 billion gallons of water, enough to sustain about 400,000 US homes for one year.2 During 2021, we continued to fund water restoration projects benefiting the watersheds that we impact and the communities where we operate, including new proj - ects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ireland, Malaysia, and India."

T otal savings of 256 million gallons were achieved during 2021.
"We estimate that we will save 450 million gallons in 2022, increasing to over 700 million gallons per year by 2025."
"During 2021, we made significant progress in the operation of our on-site water reclaim facilities."
"These innovative water treatment plants allow Intel to treat and reuse water within our operations in systems such as cooling towers and scrubbers, resulting in a substan - tial increase in water conservation."
"Our Ocotillo water recycling facility in Arizona , for example, treated and reused approximately 1.1 billion gallons of water during 2021."
Wicklow Mountains National Park Blanket Bog Restoration Project National Parks and Wildlife Service.
Intels first water restoration project in Ireland is a pilot project that will re-wet close to 150 acres of degraded peat bog to increase water storage levels by an estimated 13 million gallons each year.
"These headwaters supply the Poulaphouca (Blessington) reservoir, a drinking water source for the greater Dublin area."
"The bog restoration will also protect biodiversity and improve carbon storage, and is likely to improve water quality."
"Upon completion of the pilot, the resulting data will be used to evaluate a full-scale peat bog restoration effort."
Agua Tica Forest Protection Fundecor.
"This project, which is expected to restore up to 46 million gallons of water per year, aims to promote water restoration through innovative forest protection schemes in Agua Ticas action area."
Agua Tica is the first public-private water fund established in Costa Rica with the purpose of improving water quality and quantity access through a green infrastructure investment portfolio.

Introduction Our Business Responsible Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix74 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportWaste and Circular Economy Solutions Much of the waste we generate results from construction and manufacturing activities.
"Since the mid-1990s, we have increased our global recycling rate of non- hazardous waste from 25% to 89% even while Intels business and production continued to grow."
"We also decreased our total waste generation by 17% between 2020 and 2021, despite increased manufacturing complexity and company growth."
"As part of our 2030 goals, we have expanded our commitment to achieve zero total waste to landfill, and increased our focus on implementing circular economy strategies for our manufacturing waste streams."
"Circular Solutions for Manufacturing Waste Major semiconductor manufacturing-related waste streams include lithography-related solvents, metal plating waste, specialty base cleaners, spent sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate, and calcium fluoride."
"Our operations also generate plastic, metal, kitchen, and general office waste."
We continue to find ways to recover materials and regenerate resources to create circular economy solutions that reduce costs and environmental impact.
"In 2021, we reused, recovered, or recycled 65% of our manufacturing waste, or approximately 133,000 metric tons."
Intel is investing in segregating constituents of our spent solvent waste to enable our waste vendors to more easily refine the high-value solvent and reintro - duce it into the merchant market as a replacement raw material.
"This will also decrease the fossil fuel combustion required for the distillation process by over 50%, leading to a reduction in GHG emissions at the waste vendors facility."
"We also send sulfuric acid waste from our manufacturing operations to an off-site facility, where it is processed to technical grade sulfuric acid."
"It is then directed back to our manufacturing operations, where we use it in on-site wastewater treatment systems.2030 Goal: Zero Waste1/Circular Economy Description."
Achieve zero total waste to landfill and implement circular economy strategies for 60% of our manufac - turing waste streams in partnership with our suppliers.
Baseline.
"During 2020, 5% of our total waste went to landfill, and we had implemented circular economy strategies for 65% of manufacturing waste."
Progress in 2021.
"By the end of 2021, we maintained 5% total waste to landfill and implemented circular strategies for 65% of our manufacturing waste."
"Our 2030 goal of 60% will be challenging in future years given our projected growth and new waste streams, suppliers, and locations that will require new circular economy strategies."
Looking Ahead.
"In 2022, we plan to continue to focus on opportunities to upcycle waste by working further on waste segregation practices and collaborating with our suppliers to evaluate new technology for waste recovery and reuse."

"Intels supply chain plays a pivotal role through the implementation of circular economy solutions for manufacturing waste upcycling, extending the useful life of equipment and returned products, materials reclaim, and the use of post-consumer recycled materials on transportation media."
"The consolidated efforts across the supply chain resulted in: 131,000 metric tons in total landfill avoidance, including 5,900 metric tons through the reuse of capital tools."
Less than 1% of high-value e-waste went to landfill.
"2,000 metric tons of material sent for precious metals (gold, platinum, copper, etc.)"

A 54% reuse/recovery rate on product returned to Intel.
An increase of e-waste collection to 40 countries globally.
"The extended life of more than 13,000 computing assets into secondary market programs."
An estimated reduction of up to 500 metric tons of Scope 3 CO2 emissions.
"T o build on these benefits and drive increased focus and coordination, we are taking an integrated approach across our supply chain groups (Materials and Equipment Sourcing, Logistics, and Resale) to building a common set of circular economy performance metrics."
These metrics are aligned to the Intel 2030 RISE goals of zero waste to landfill and implementing circular economy strategies.
"In 2021, we recycled over 78,000 metric tons, or 96%, of our construction waste."
Sustainable Packaging Intel has a history of practicing sustainable packaging methods to improve packaging designs and sustainable material selection.
"We focus on reducing unfavorable material, increasing material efficiency, designing for recovery and recycling, prioritizing recycled content, and sourcing responsible materials."
"Working with suppliers, we developed a reusable precision thermoform tray for incoming material and for finished goods shipping to customers and eliminated piece part trays that were historically sent to landfill."
The mass of the thermoform tray is 50% of that of an industry injection molded tray and made of a more recyclable material (PET).
The closed pocket elimi - nates non-recyclable covers that were previously used to prevent product contamination in typical industry trays.
We worked to include post-consumer recycled material in the thermoform trays so that nearly half of the tray is non-virgin material.
"Since 2009, we conservatively estimate that we have eliminated over 18,000 metric tons of plastic material through these initiatives."
"T o drive further progress, we set a target that by 2025, over 95% of the materials used in our new product packaging designs, by weight, will be recyclable or reusable."
"As of the end of 2021, we were ex - ceeding this goal, at 96%."

Sustainable Manufacturing Intel is committed to contributing to the global effort toward science-based approaches to GHG emissions reductions in line with efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C.
"However, we face challenges in gaining formal approval for an emissions-reduction target under the existing methodology of the Science-Based T argets Initiative (SBTi) due to a number of factors: First, the absolute contraction approach for setting science-based targets does not take into account early action to reduce absolute emissions."
"The convergence approach within SBTi's sectoral decarbonization approach (SDA) enables consideration of early action, but there is currently no SDA for the semiconductor industry."
"Second, demand for semiconductors is increasing, due in part to the role that technology plays in driving climate solutions."
Current frameworks do not include consider - ation of the application of technology to reduce climate impact in global manufacturing.
"In addition, emissions pathways for non-CO2 gases may differ from those for CO2 due to differences in factors such as mitigation potential."
Process emissions for the semiconductor manufacturing industry include non- CO2 gases such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and nitrous oxide.
Consideration of sector-specific differ - ences in emissions pathways for CO2 and non-CO2 GHG emissions is a potential area of importance for future research and for expanding opportunities for sector- specific approaches to targets.
"In 2021, we continued to work with industry stakeholders to assess the potential for the development of a sector- specific approach to setting science-based GHG emissions-reduction targets for the semiconductor manufacturing industry."
The goal is to expand the number of companies in our sector setting science- based targets.
Sustainable Chemistry Sustainable chemistry is a scientific concept that seeks to improve the efficiency with which natural resources are used to meet human needs for chemical products and services.
"Sustainable chemistry encompasses the design, manufacture, and use of efficient, effective, safe, and more environmentally benign chemical products and processes."
"Sustainable chemistry is also a process that stimulates innovation across all sectors to design and discover new chemicals, production processes, and product stewardship practices that will provide increased performance and value while meeting the goals of protecting and enhancing human health and the environment.1 Our 2030 sustainable chemistry initiative is based upon the development and implementation of a chemical foot - print methodology to enable quantification of a baselines against which further progress can be measured, as well as to identify those chemical uses and processes for which significant improvements can be made."
"We intend to apply the chemical footprint methodology not only to Intels direct manufacturing operations, but also to integrate the methodology within the semicon - ductor manufacturing supply chain both upstream and downstream of our manufacturing operations."
"In 2021, Intels Sustainable Chemistry T eam continued efforts to refine the chemical footprint methodology for use in evaluation of the chemical supply chain, as well as to integrate the methodology into the chemical supply chain to enable better assessment of full lifecycle impact."
"In addition, we continued to provide webinars to further the promotion of the chemical footprint meth - odology as a technology industry initiative."
"Sustainable chemistry baselines were completed for the current manufacturing technologies, as well as for the year 2020."
"We also completed an initial analysis of current chemical uses, and those identified as the highest impact chemistries have been included within a set of priority projects to further scope and disposition."
"In 2022, we plan to complete a proof of concept to enable visualization of the top impact chemical uses by mass and chemical footprint values, and to identify po - tential projects that will result in meaningful reductions in chemical footprint values."
"In addition, we will continue to actively participate in external chemical management initiatives geared toward the improvement of chemical management practices within our supply chain."
"Chemical Footprint Methodology Manufacturing Chemical Footprint = Mass of Chemical Used xWeighting Factors* For each chemical used, we have assigned a weighting factor from 1-4, with 4 representing the biggest impact."
The methodology will also take into consideration the effectiveness of the control technology.

"Introduction Our Business Responsible Inclusive Sustainable Enabling Appendix78 intel.com/responsibility 2021-22 Corporate Responsibility ReportReducing the Carbon Impact of Data Centers and the Network We have worked with our worldwide ecosystem to reduce data center carbon impact in two areas: 1) Lowering energy consumption during the compute use phase, which accounts for the primary source of data center carbon emissions; and 2) Reducing the embodied carbon in the equipment itself in the create phase, which represents roughly 10%-20% of emissions."
Use phase.
The primary source of emissions in the use phase is from electricity used to power the data center and network.
"One of the ways we are reducing electricity use is through AI-based telemetry, which intelligently monitors and controls electricity in the data center and throughout the network."
"Intel Xeon Scalable processors incorporate registers for monitoring cache, CPU frequencies, memory bandwidth, and input/ output (I/O) access."
"These telemetry capabilities show the potential for significant energy savings at scale; within its data center that houses 5G communication facilities, Japan T elecommunications operator KDDI reduced overall electricity consumption by 20% in a trial using 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intels comprehensive power management and AI capabilities."
Create phase.
"Intel is focusing on efforts to reduce the carbon footprint at a platform level by enabling modular component design where CPU, I/O, and accelerator modules can be repaired or upgraded independently to extend the useful life of the platform."
"Working alongside key data center partners, we are contributing to the Open Compute Project (OCP) to advance modular designs, establish carbon footprint metrics, and set reduction goals."
"The most recent advancements are specified in the Blue Glacier project, which published a Revision 1 specification for modular design through OCP."
Optimizing software for sustainability.
"We work with the worlds largest cloud and communications service providers, independent software vendors, and open source software communities to optimize hundreds of data center and network applications to address software inefficiencies."
"Software efficiency continues to lag hardware capabilities, resulting in wasted electricity and higher carbon footprint through over-provisioning of equipment."
"Intel introduced oneAPI to better exploit the latest hardwares cutting-edge features to unleash application performance across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators."
Emerging Innovation.
Other ways Intel is working to increase data center and network efficiency include: Advanced liquid cooling technologies that reduce the data center air conditioning burden while enabling reuse of exhaust heat are in various stages of proof-of- concept and production deployment.
This technology can reduce cooling electricity expenses by 90% and the carbon footprint by 40%.

"Digital Access for the Next 50% Intel formed an alliance with 50 partners from Fortune 500 companies, NGOs, and academiaincluding Dell, World Wide T echnology, and African Mobile Networks to build the N50 Project ."
"The project, part of the IRTI, aims to bring access to affordable digital content, applications, and services to the next 3.9 billion people to provide health, social, and financial benefits to margin - alized communities."
"In partnership with the N50 Project, the Intel Foundation is providing funding to Geeks Without Frontiers to build 10 solar-powered communica - tion centers in areas neighboring Ukraine."
"The centers, equipped with connectivity, charging ports, and more, aim to alleviate communication and information challenges for millions of refugees."
"Voice Banking T echnology for Motor Neurone Disease According to the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association , one in every 300 people will receive a diagnosis of MNDa condition that progressively robs a persons ability to move, speak, eat, and drink."
"Scientists have yet to discover a cure for MND, but technology is helping those living with the disease."
"Intel, Dell T echnolo - gies, Rolls-Royce, and the MND Association are partnering to apply voice banking technology to drive positive change for people with MND."
The technology solution works by training an AI-based algorithm that will serve as digital voice for someone who may lose their ability to speak in the future.
The digital voice can create any word or sentence with the same characteristics as the original voice using learned critical words and syllables.
"Record -ings are analyzed and digitized by SpeakUniques cloud computing infrastructure, which runs on Amazons EC2 instances and is powered by Intel Xeon processor- based servers."
"One Intel team helped shape the user experience and accessibility, while another contributed expertise gained from past voice accessibility projects with renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who had ALS, the most common type of MND."
What I think is brilliant about this project is that you're asking people to do something thats very natural to them.
"True acces - sibility is about recognizing the human experience and building around it, said Lama Nachman, Intel Fellow and director of the Human & AI Systems Research Lab."
Nachmans team built the communication platform that Hawking used and made it accessible to everyone through open-source platforms.

Follow-up walkdowns are performed with fire and rescue department to verify closure of each finding.
"The site implemented a robust process for capturing, assigning, closing, tracking, communicating, and verifying closure of findings."
"Aloha, Oregon A decommissioned chemical metering pump was being removed from the acid waste neutralization system."
"After the drain of the sulfuric acid line was completed, a flush of residual chemical and water was performed that was routed back into the tank."
"As a result, the wastewater outfall dropped below the permitted limit for approximately three minutes.$100 The local agency was notified within two hours per the sites wastewater permit."
Individuals were coached on non-standard work and preventative measures.
Isolation is required for work that may involve loss of control or indication of last stage acid waste neutralization tanks.
