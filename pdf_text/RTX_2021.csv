Our Board provides active and independent oversight and guidance to management.
"Given the importance of ESG to our values and strategy, the Board is also increasingly focused on our ESG positions, risks and initiatives."
"In 2021, the Board amended the charters of the Governance and Public Policy Committee (GPPC) and the Human Capital & Compensation Committee (HCCC) to clarify and enhance oversight responsibility for certain ESG topics."

"The CRS comprises two categories, People & Culture and Sustainability & Safety, that incorporate various objectives that are intended to reinforce the companys commitment to our long-term goals, including diverse representation and greenhouse gas emissions."
"The People & Culture and Sustainability & Safety categories are each weighted at 10%, with our financial metrics earnings and free cash flow each weighted at 40%."

"Our goal is to send our employees home safely, every day."
Our efforts start with our proactive safety culture.
"Every employee, from workers on the manufacturing floor to senior leaders, shares responsibility for our collective health and safety."
This shared goal and responsibility is a major contributor to our continued growth and success.
Our actions have led to a 12% reduction in our total recordable incident rate since the 2019 baseline.
"Our ambitious 2025 goals center on leading indicators of workplace safety, so we can identify issues before they become incidents."
"Protecting employee health and safety2025 workplace safety goals Ergonomic injuries (including injuries relating to lifting, lowering, pushing or pulling objects and from repetitive motion) are a leading type of workplace injury."
Our ergonomic goal focuses on reducing risk in order to proactively prevent injuries from occurring.

Our goal proactively targets reducing potential exposure well beyond what is required by regulation to further protect employee health.
We have set a goal to ensure that all operations implement a robust near-miss reporting system that encourages reporting hazards before they can result in an employee illness or injury.
"Identifying near-miss events is an essential part of a mature, proactive safety culture, resulting in a workplace that is safe from hazards and employees who are injury free."
"* W e use the 2015 baseline for high ergonomic risk, as both of our heritage organizations, Raytheon and United Technologies, had 2020 goals to reduce high ergonomic risk from that baseline."
Our 2025 goal is a continuation of their original goals.
The baseline for medium risk was set in 2020 after the merger when the 2025 goals were established.
** W e conducted a complete analysis of chemical and noise risks in 2021 to establish this baseline.
"01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix 19 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 EH&S Management System We employ our EH&S Management System, the cornerstone of our Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) program, as the roadmap for driving us toward our zero-injury ambition."
The EH&S Management System starts with an understanding of the health and safety risks present in our organization and the EH&S laws and regulations governing our operations.
"It documents a standard to which we hold ourselves accountable for key EH&S practices including, for example, emergency preparedness, working at heights and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment."
The EH&S Management System also drives us to continually improve.
"We developed the system using key elements from established external management system standards, with a focus on preventing incidents and, if incidents do occur, identifying root causes and implementing appropriate remedial actions.85% decrease in high and elevated ergonomic risks* 16% decrease in medium ergonomic risks** 34% of applicable sites have met requirements to ensure robust near-miss reporting 12% reduction in total recordable incident rate (TRIR) since 20192019 2020 20210.41 0.340.36Annual total recordable incident rate*** 2019 2020 20210.09 0.090.12Annual lost day incident rate (LDIR)***2021 progress toward our workplace safety 2025 goals * Sinc e 2015."

"We focus on reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency in our operations worldwide, including involvement in renewable electricity projects and contracts."
"Progressing toward decarbonizing aviation We are developing a broad portfolio of solutions, based on a number of different technologies, to help advance the air transport industrys commitment to reach net-zero by 2050."
"In addition, we have been collaborating with stakeholders across the value chain to support the development and use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and other technologies that improve overall aircraft fuel economy."
Collaborating with suppliers Our supplier relationships are critical to the continued success of our business.
"We work closely with all areas of our supply chain to ensure we use quality, responsibly sourced materials in our products."
"We also require our suppliers to both comply with environmental, health and safety laws and operate in a way that conserves natural resources and prevents pollution."
"Minimizing resource usage We track, and aim to reduce, the water we use and the waste we produce."
Were especially focused on reducing waste disposed via the most environmentally harmful disposal methods.
We also monitor the chemicals we use throughout our manufacturing processes and strive to reduce adverse effects to human health and the environment.
"We recognize we have an important role to play in addressing the climate challenges associated with our industry, and we are committed to improving environmental performance of our products and business."
Climate change is at the forefront of the long-term environmental issues we face today.
"In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported the importance of the ambition of limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels."
"There is no silver bullet that can singularly resolve the climate change problem; instead, the challenge demands a collective response at a global scale."
"We are well positioned to help address this crisis thanks to the scale of our company, the ingenuity of our people and our history of rising to meet generational challenges."
"Our leadership role in the aerospace industry provides a critical platform, given that aviation is one of the hardest-to-abate sectors in terms of cutting GHG emissions and that traffic volume is poised to double roughly every 20years to further connect the world and advance global development."
"As an aerospace and defense manufacturer, we recognize that our greatest potential impact on addressing climate change is reducing emissions through the products we design, develop, manufacture and support."
"Weve made a number of new commitments focused on reducing GHG emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) as well as emissions outside of our operations in our value chain (Scope 3 emissions), including but not limited to emissions from the use of our products, the total of which are significantly larger than emissions from our operations."
"In this section, we will discuss in detail our progress and commitments in addressing environmental issues, with a particular focus on GHG emissions."
"We also discuss our longstanding commitment to environmental matters, including significant progress on our waste and water performance."

33 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix 33 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021On the path to decarbonize aviation Raytheon Technologies takes pride in the role it plays in connecting people and cultures.
"As a longtime aerospace manufacturer, we take seriously our responsibility to provide safe, fast, efficient and economically viable ways for people to fly to meet one another."
"Our storied tradition of innovation in aviation began with Pratt & Whitneys inception in 1925, followed by Collins in 1933."
"Just as our founders sought to bring life to a new industry with cutting-edge technologies, today Raytheon Technologies is creating the future with higher performing and more sustainable aerospace solutions."
Sustainable development is vital for the future of the aviation industry.
Key aviation industry organizations such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) fully recognize that the aerospace industry must play a critical role in ensuring global temperatures do not increase more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The aerospace industry faces many complex challenges to meet this goal.
"As ATAGs Waypoint 2050 report outlines, air transport is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize due to a lack of off-the-shelf technologies that provide energy solutions meeting the speed and distance requirements for aviation."
The aerospace industry currently contributes around 2% of global carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions.
"However, given the projected growth of air traffic demand, the industry predicts its carbon emissions will more than double by 2050 relative to 2019 levels if technology does not improve and get adopted."
Raytheon Technologies and our business units Pratt & Whitney and Collins support the ATAG Fly Net-zero commitment to achieve industrywide net-zero carbon emissions in civil aviation by 2050.
"The future of sustainable aerospace hinges on multiple, distinct technologies some of which are just emerging."
"As breakthrough aerospace technologies are developed, their safety must be rigorously tested before they enter into service."
"This maturation process will take time, which is why Raytheon Technologies has a broad portfolio of solutions at varying levels of maturity to help reduce GHG emissions in the aerospace sector now and in the future."

The GTF engine builds on a long track record of innovation and efficiency gains at Pratt & Whitney a 70% improvement in fuel efficiency since we introduced the JT8D in the 1960s.
This engine is the industrys best-in-class for single-aisle applications.
"Our engineers revolutionized the traditional jet engine architecture, adding a gear system in between the fan in the front and the turbine in the back, so that the fan and the turbine can spin at their optimal speeds for improved efficiency."
"This geared architecture enables reduction in the number of engine stages and airfoils, providing industry-leading efficiency, weight and environmental benefits to the engine."
The GTF engine is the only geared propulsion system in service that is delivering industry-leading sustainability benefits.
"Since entering into service in 2016, this technology has saved operators 600 million gallons of fuel and avoided nearly 6 million metric tons of CO 2."
Our engineers are determined to drive additional incremental emissions reductions.
"To that end, this past December we announced a newer model that will be available in 2024, the GTF Advantage TM engine, that will improve the reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions to 17% versus the 2015 baseline."
"We are also ensuring that the GTF engine will be compatible with 100% SAF, to further reduce engine emissions."
"* At the same time, Collins is improving the efficiency of turboprop aircraft propulsion with advanced propeller systems."
"In 2019, Collins announced a new center in France to develop enhancements for existing propellers, new systems for future turboprop, and disruptive technologies for next-generation aircraft, while also helping to reduce cycle times for customers through increased automation."
"The center optimizes propeller designs that improve aerodynamics and reduce weight, fuel consumption and noise."
"Further improving the efficiency of aircraft engines will require innovation across several areas, including: Additionally, we have previously established and fully developed comprehensive processes that ensure emissions (GHG and non-GHG) from our aircraft engines comply with both current and future requirements issued by the governing International Civil Aviation Organization."

The engine and motor power balance is coordinated by advanced control systems to work together in parallel to optimize the efficiency of the propulsion system throughout the flight envelope.
"We estimate that our advanced GTF with hybrid-electric technology will provide efficiency improvements that enable a 25% reduction in CO 2 emissions by 2035, relative to 2015 baseline technology."
We are working across our business units and innovation teams to make hybrid-electric propulsion a reality for the next generation of commercial engines.
We are uniquely positioned to lead aerospace in electrification in commercial aviation through the combination of Collins expertise in aviation electrical systems and Pratt & Whitneys propulsion system manufacturing and integration capabilities.
"Initiatives within the hybrid-electric space include: The Collins, Pratt & Whitney and RTRC partnership with NASA, Penn State University, Georgia Tech and Howard University to develop hybrid-electric propulsion technologies."
"A $163 million Canadian Dollars Pratt & Whitney project supported by the governments of Canada and Quebec to develop a regional aircraft-scale hybrid-electric demonstrator, together with Collins and De Havilland Aircraft of Canada."
"With this demonstrator, we are targeting a 30% fuel efficiency improvement compared to todays best turboprops, with flight testing planned for 2024."
(See From gas to hybrid-electric: A demonstrator collaboration.)
From gas to hybrid-electric: a demonstrator collaboration Stakeholder collaborations are a key ingredient in the sustainable aerospace future.
"Consider the work Pratt & Whitney and Collins have undertaken in collaboration with De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited, the Canadian government and the government of Quebec."
"Together, these organizations are working on a hybrid-electric demonstrator with a De Havilland Dash 8 regional aircraft that could significantly reduce emissions from fuel consumption."
"The demonstrator will replace one of the aircrafts conventional gas turbine engines with a hybrid-electric propulsion system that pairs a 1MW electric motor with a 1MW internal combustion engine, for a total of 2MW propulsive power."
A production aircraft with two hybrid-electric engines has the potential to reduce fuel consumption by 30% for short haul flights.
The project will target testing a demo engine in 2022 and flight testing a full hybrid-electric flight demonstrator in 2024.
This demonstrator is a key milestone on the path to development of a commercially viable hybrid-electric aircraft.

"Raytheon Technologies has the full portfolio of technologies needed to enable hydrogen-based propulsion solutions, including: Hydrogen-burning engine concepts are not new for Pratt & Whitney, which first demonstrated a hydrogen-burning aircraft engine in the 1950s."
"Current concepts are more advanced, bringing meaningful improvements in overall engine efficiency through various means, including leveraging the cryogenic temperatures of the fuel as a heat sink for the aircraft."
"We also have collaborated with our partners in Japan to undertake low-NOx combustion of hydrogen, a critical step toward ensuring this technology has an important role to play in aviation decarbonization."
Pratt & Whitney has been selected by the U.
"S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop novel, high-efficiency hydrogen-fueled propulsion technology for commercial aviation, as part of DOEs Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E)."
"The Hydrogen Steam Injected Intercooled Turbine Engine (HySIITE) uses liquid hydrogen combustion and water vapor recovery to achieve zero in-flight CO 2 emissions, while reducing NOx emissions by up to 80% and reducing fuel consumption by up to 35%."
The HySIITE engine will burn hydrogen in a Brayton (thermodynamic) cycle and use steam injection to dramatically reduce NOx.
"Via an innovative semi-closed system architecture, HySIITE aims to achieve thermal efficiency greater than fuel cells and reduce total operating cost to be comparable with drop in SAF."
"Additionally, as an alternate to cryogenic hydrogen fuels, our team at RTRC is working on engine concepts that are powered by intermediate hydrogen fuels such as ammonia, which bring the benefits of hydrogen propulsion in a more transportable fuel."

S. Department of Energy program.
"Under a $2.6 million research grant from ARPA-E, Raytheon Technologies is developing a turboelectric aviation propulsion system that would use ammonia as both a fuel and a coolant potentially paving the way for the decarbonized future of flight."
"Ammonia is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, and can be used as a fuel that produces no carbon emissions from combustion."
"As part of our roadmap to 2050, the RTRC and ARPA-E have partnered to explore the possibilities of ammonia in civil aviation."
"Although both hydrogen and ammonia produce zero carbon emissions, ammonia has a few distinct advantages as it does not need to be stored nearly as cold (-33C vs. -253C for liquid hydrogen)."
"Ammonia is also more energy dense than hydrogen by volume, which translates to less aircraft structural weight and drag."
This program involves designing new systems that can convert liquid ammonia into its desired gaseous state for combustion.
"As the graphic at right shows, this process would involve a fuel tank to store the liquid ammonia, a pressurization pump, a heat exchanger, a catalytic cracking unit and a combustion chamber within the engine."
"Ammonia-powered flight Fuel tankPumpHeat exchangerCatalytic cracking unitCombustionchamber The ammonia starts as a liquid in the fuel tank, where its kept at -33C.1 Fuel tankHeat exchangerCatalytic cracking unitCombustionchamber PumpFrom there it goes into a pump for pressurization, then to a heat exchanger, which warms it to a gaseous state.2 Fuel tankPumpHeat exchangerCatalytic cracking unitCombustionchamber Then it goes to the catalytic cracking unit, where it receives even more heat and starts to decompose into hydrogen and nitrogen molecules.3 Fuel tankPumpHeat exchangerCatalytic cracking unitCombustionchamberThe fuel is fed into the combustion chamber and propels the plane forward with no carbon emissions.440 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix High-temperature materials and manufacturing technologies reduce fuel burn In 2021, Pratt & Whitney opened a ceramic matrix composites (CMC) R&D facility in Carlsbad, California."
"The 60,000-square-foot facility is dedicated to the engineering, development and low-rate production of CMC components for aerospace applications."
"These innovative ceramic composites are lighter and can withstand higher temperatures, which improves thermal efficiency for gas turbine engines."
"When ready, these materials will be integrated into military and commercial engines to increase range, improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions."
"In addition to the Carlsbad facility, Pratt & Whitney announced in late 2020 that we would be opening a new turbine airfoil production facility in Asheville, North Carolina."
This $650 million facility will use the latest technologies and processes to manufacture the next generation of turbine airfoils.
Aircraft system improvements Introducing lighter-weight and more energy-efficient aircraft equipment systems The weight and energy efficiency of airborne systems and equipment are critical variables that affect fuel burn and emissions for aircraft as a whole.
"Collins and Pratt & Whitney have focused on leveraging the latest materials and design and manufacturing processes to produce the lightest and most efficient aircraft products ever made, contributing to overall aircraft energy efficiency and helping reduce aircraft emissions."
"An aircrafts weight is directly correlated to its fuel burn, payload and range."
"We estimate that, under cruise conditions, every 1,000 pounds of weight reduction results in a 0.7% fuel savings for an average single-aisle aircraft."
"Key efforts across our business units to reduce aircraft system weight include: Leveraging advanced lightweight materials, including using composites for structural elements ranging from engine nacelles to cabin seats."
"For example: The DURACARB carbon brake technology from Collins saves about 700 pounds of weight on single-aisle aircraft, along with improved performance and durability."
"We are reducing weight by applying thermoset and thermoplastic composites to aerostructures, as well as to mechanical parts such as struts and shafts."
Advanced composite fan blades and fan cases for next-generation GTF engines enable lower weight with increased durability and operational capability.
Leveraging advanced manufacturing processes to make it possible to optimize product weight.
"Where possible, our engineers leverage technologies such as additive manufacturing and tomolithographic molding (TOMO) to produce equipment designs that are lighter weight than anything produced with conventional manufacturing technologies, without compromising on safety, quality or reliability."
We are also focused on improving energy efficiency in aircraft equipment.
"A broad class of equipment, including electronics, avionics, actuation, fuel systems and environmental control systems (ECS), consume aircraft energy in electric, hydraulic or pneumatic form."
Reducing equipment energy consumption directly translates into lower overall aircraft fuel consumption and lower emissions.
"Our efforts to improve equipment energy efficiency include: Deploying an electrified ECS for the Boeing 787, one of the clean-sheet-design aircraft in the new century."
"This system pressurizes and conditions cabin air by using electric power from the engine generators to drive compressors, taking fresh air via dedicated inlets instead of the more traditional approach of taking bleed air from the engine."
"From engine power extraction to cabin air compression, this concept yields a net efficiency gain and a reduction of fuel consumption."
"Converting hydraulic actuation to electric actuation, improving overall system efficiency and weight, such as in the electric actuation flight control systems on the Airbus A380."
Improving the energy efficiency of power electronics used in power distribution systems and motor drives through the use of advanced electronic designs and more efficient semiconductor devices.

Investing $18 million to develop smart actuation components for commercial airplanes and helicopters in our center of excellence for actuation systems in France.
This Collins program is supported through a four-year R&D program grant from the French Civil Aviation Authority.
"The investment will be used to develop a number of solutions, including a lighter, more compact motorized gearbox; more compact actuator structures with improved thermal management; a full-authority actuator to enable fly-by-wire for all helicopter platforms; AI-enabled prognostics and health management capabilities; and an advanced modular electro-mechanical actuator that can be used across a number of platforms."
"Innovations in thermoplastics Collins recently acquired Dutch Thermoplastics Components (DTC), a leader in the development and fabrication of structural thermoplastic composite parts."
"Thermoplastics composites offer higher impact resistance, unique process possibilities providing reductions in manufacturing cycle time and the need for fewer fasteners, in addition to what could be offered by traditional thermoset composites, such as strength and lighter weight."
"Further, thermoplastic composites are recyclable at the end of their life cycle."
"This acquisition underscores our commitment to using advanced materials and processes to address key areas of importance for our customers: weight reduction for fuel savings, reliability improvements and sustainable practices across the product life cycle."

Several solutions from Raytheon Technologies work together to unlock the ability to optimize and reliably execute optimized flight trajectories.
The combination of these solutions could reduce air transport emissions by 8% on average per flight by 2050 compared with 2015 baselines.
"Global air-ground data communications capabilities, such as Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Contract (ADS-C) and ARINC Global Network, and messaging services to enable TBO by providing digital connectivity between the Air Navigations Service Provider (ANSP), the Operations Control Center (OCC) and the aircraft."

"We continue this effort in support of the aviation industry objective to identify multiple 100% SAFs that will minimize environmental impact, increase availability and reduce cost."
We are currently partnering with ATR and Embraer on a 100% SAF flight demonstration program.
We aim to enable release of industry specifications for 100% SAF that is safe and approved by regulators to operate on all current and legacy engines.
"We continue to support technical efforts to increase approval of multiple pathways for blended and 100% SAF as a founding member of the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative (CAAFI), an industry-government coalition charged with developing, approving and releasing specifications for SAFs that meet all regulatory safety requirements."
The goal is to support the development of new pathways to scale up production capability and drive down cost.
"We support ATAGs efforts to collaborate with industry regulators, customers and partners to encourage global alignment for the development of a roadmap for sufficient global AAF production, including but not limited to SAF, to support 85% of aviation industry energy needs by 2050."
"And along the way, we aim to support the aviation industry to achieve 30% AAF (primarily SAF) availability relative to demand by 2035.Enabling the use of alternative aviation fuels The most common fuel used by commercial aircraft is Jet A, a kerosene- based fuel that meets specific performance and safety requirements."
AAFs include SAFs and other alternatives such as hydrogen and ammonia.
"SAFs are renewable synthetic jet fuels that can be produced by converting biomass feedstock and waste into liquid fuels, or alternatively by chemically combining CO 2 and hydrogen."
AAFs are poised to have an immense impact on the aviation sectors path toward net-zero.
Several SAFs have been approved within industry specifications (ASTM D1655) to be used as a 50% blend with conventional jet fuel.
"Todays pure SAFs offer up to an 80% or more reduction in fuel life cycle CO 2 emissions relative to fossil-fuel based jet fuel, yet SAFs currently comprise less than 0.1% of global jet fuel consumption."
Focused investments from industry and governments are occurring to increase global SAF production and reduce cost.
"The goal is to drive increased availability and use, which ATAG has projected to rise exponentially in this decade."
"Pratt & Whitney has been active in SAF testing and certification for almost two decades, and all of our modern engines are currently compatible with the approved 50% SAF blend."
"Collins designs and integrates advanced fuel measurement and management systems, as well as other fuel system components, such as fuel controls, pumps, valves and nozzles for nearly every type of engine and aircraft."
"Today, these systems and components are compatible with approved 50% SAF blends."
"In collaboration with engine and aircraft manufacturers, Collins is working to ensure compatibility with unblended (100% or neat) SAFs to provide even greater environmental benefit."
"Ensuring compatibility with 100% SAF may require testing, requalification or recertification, and in some cases the redesign of components or subcomponents depending on the future standards of 100% SAF."
"For example, for current fuel gauging systems Collins has developed a densitometer device that directly measures the density of fuel, allowing a 1% fuel quantity accuracy regardless of fuel type."
"For new aircraft, Collins is developing a pressure-based fuel gauging system that directly measures the pressure of fuel so we can accurately calculate fuel quantity regardless of type."
"In addition to our efforts at Raytheon Technologies, the contributions of airframers, SAF producers and others are essential to reach the air transport industrys net-zero 2050 goal."
"Across the industry, we must innovate separately and together to reach this essential milestone."

46 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 202147 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix Greenhouse gas emission reduction from our operations is a key element of our sustainability program.
We recognize our responsibility to operate our facilities in ways that efficiently use resources and minimize emissions to help respond to climate change.
We have developed robust programs and organization-wide reduction goals and track progress regularly to ensure we meet our commitments.
"These efforts are overseen by our corporate senior vice president of operations and supply chain, who is the highest ranking internal official responsible for climate change and sustainability."
"At the Board level, the Governance and Public Policy Committee provides oversight on climate-related issues, and the full Board is also periodically briefed on climate-related initiatives."
"In addition, our emission reduction targets are part of the Sustainability & Safety objectives under our Corporate Responsibility Scorecard (CRS) to our Executive Annual Incentive Plan."
"In 2021, we announced a goal to reduce GHGs from our operations 10% by 2025 from 2019 levels."
"Due to the increased urgency of the climate crisis, we are setting a longer-term, more aggressive GHG goal that aligns with a 1.5 degree Celsius science-based pathway as identified in the Paris climate agreement."
Our new goal is to reduce emissions by 46% by 2030 Decarbonizing our operations Our expanded climate-related goals for our operations 15% reduction in GHGs by 2025 from 2019 2.5% reduction in energy consumption by 2025 from 2019 10% renewable electricity usage by 2025 46% reduction in GHGs by 2030 from 2019 100% implementation of 11 energy/GHG best management practices (BMPs) by 2025 from 2019 levels.
Limiting global warming increase to 1.5 degree Celsius is increasingly being recognized as what is needed to prevent the most harmful effects of climate change.
"As an interim milestone toward our 2030 goal, we are raising our 2025 GHG goal to 15% (market-based) to align with a well below 2 degree Celsius science-based pathway."
"In addition, we are setting renewable electricity and energy consumption goals that will support and guide our GHG reduction efforts."
"We selected a 2019 baseline because it is the most recent year not impacted by COVID-19.While decarbonizing our operations is important, we recognize that decarbonizing along our value stream to address Scope 3 GHG emissions, particularly associated with the use of our products, has the potential for a much more significant impact on our overall emissions."
(See On the path to decarbonize aviation for our commitment to addressing our product emissions.)
"In addition, we are working to improve our measurement of relevant categories of Scope 3 emissions.48 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix Our strong energy programs earned Raytheon Technologies the 2021 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award from the U."
S. Environmental Protection Agency.
"Energy and greenhouse gas emissions Our original 2025 GHG goal included Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope3 business travel emissions."
"Scope 1 emissions are those directly released from our facilities, such as combustion of natural gas or jet fuel for engine testing."
Scope 2 emissions are primarily from electricity use.
Scope 3 business travel includes employee business air travel and car rental.
"In future years, we will be tracking performance towards our Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) GHG reduction goals."
"Our GHG emissions in 2021 were 1,507,000 metric tons of CO2 e 23% lower than our 2019 emissions."
"Our Scope 1 emissions represent 34% of that total, while Scope 2 (location-based emissions) represents 62% and Scope 3 business travel makes up 4%."
"However, our 2021 GHG emissions are lower than is typical due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic."
We expect our GHG emissions to increase over the next couple of years.
Another 2025 goal is 100% implementation of energy/GHG best management practices (BMPs) by 2025.
These are 11 proven processes and initiatives that help reduce energy use and emissions.
"As of the end of 2021, we have implemented 47% of them."
"These practices include evaluating building automation, reviewing our HVAC systems, improving equipment maintenance programs and implementing lighting updates."
"Reducing energy consumption Within our operations, energy consumption accounts for approximately 90% of our GHG emissions."
"Therefore, a central decarbonization strategy involves reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency in our operations."
We are constantly looking to identify and execute energy conservation and efficiency projects.
"In 2021, Raytheon Technologies business units invested over $12million in energy reduction-related projects."
"To help drive our energy reductions, we established a goal to reduce energy consumption 2.5% by 2025 from 2019 levels."
"Sites conduct energy and GHG assessments, surveys and treasure hunts to identify potential projects."
"They also perform Gemba walks on an ongoing basis to talk to the process owners in specific areas about ways to improve energy efficiencies, since the best ideas often come from employees who work in the areas."
"In 2021, we implemented more than 100 energy reduction projects of various size and reach."
We have established a cross-functional team to assist business units and sites in their energy reduction programs.
"The Conserving Raytheon Technologies Energy & Water (CREW) team oversees the standardizing of policy and processes, assists in program implementation and shares best practices."
Renewable electricity usage Renewable electricity is another important component of our decarbonization strategy.
"We are involved in over 30 renewable electricity projects and contracts around the globe that generated 92,000 megawatt hours in 2021."
"In addition to 22 renewable projects located on-site at company locations, we also purchased renewable electricity from offsite projects."
"One of our largest renewable energy contracts began in 2021 at Pratt & Whitneys site in West Palm Beach, Florida, through their participation in an off-site community solar program."
"In addition, several Collins and RI&S sites in the UK are buying green power equal to 100% of their consumption."
"Currently, 3.5% of our electricity, inclusive of all global sites, is from renewable energy resources (up from 1.5% in 2020) and we are actively looking to increase this proportion."
"As part of our expanded climate commitment, we set a goal to achieve 10% renewable electricity by 2025."
Note: Raytheon Technologies adheres to the GHG Protocol and the U.
S. EPA standards for our GHG accounting metrics.
GHG data is validated each year by a third party consistent with ISO 14064 (greenhouse gases).
"Figures represent Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based) and Scope 3, Category 6 (business travel)."
Figures from 2020 and 2021 reflect reduced GHG emissions due to the COVID-19 pandemics effect on the commercial aviation sector business.

"Climate risks are business risks and, as such, they are financial risks."
We believe the first step in managing these risks is to identify and understand them.
"Raytheon Technologies has processes in place for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks, as well as climate-related opportunities."
"One key process is our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, which we use to identify, understand, prioritize and appropriately manage the full range of significant risks to the company."
"ERM is a year-round continuous process, led by the corporate finance organization, with an annual cycle for structured reviews, discussions and decision-making."
"The top risks are compiled annually and briefed to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, as well as the full Board."
"In connection with this process, the Board allocates oversight responsibilities for these top risks among itself and its committees."
"Our well-defined, long-range strategic planning process also helps identify, assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunities, particularly transitional technology or market risks due to climate change."
"Each of our business units develops strategic plans, which are the central mechanism for setting business-level operational, technology, R&D investment and funding priorities."
"The plans are based on extensive research and analysis on the targeted markets, changes in customer needs and priorities, customer procurement, changes in public policies, technology advances and competitor assessments."
"The Board of Directors is briefed on the strategic plans, which are updated annually."
Our Business Resilience & Crisis Management (BRCM) program provides a key method for identifying and managing physical climate-related risks.
"This program is aligned with ISO 22301 (business continuity) and includes requirements and processes to help our organization prepare for, respond to and recover from a wide range of risks and threats, including natural events caused by climate change."
"The BRCM program is run by the vice president, chief security officer, who reports to the corporate senior vice president of operations and supply chain."
"Reducing climate risks, improving resilience Threat and vulnerability assessments."
"Each business site conducts a review of its physical risks, including those that may be associated with climate change."
"The review analyzes the probability and severity of, and ease of recovery from, specific events."
"The impacts of potential physical risks go well beyond the physical boundaries of our facilities and include our employees, supply chain, distribution networks and customers."
"For example, physical risks may include severe weather events, heat waves or flooding."
"Sites must perform these assessments every two years, using approved tools and methodologies."
Continuity and response plans.
"Business units and sites regularly maintain and update an incident response plan, which documents our response for physical threats and prioritizes life and safety, and is subject to audit."
"For example, weve used the BRCM process to identify, assess, prepare for and respond to hurricane threats and vulnerabilities in several areas where the company has locations, such as Florida and Puerto Rico; wildland fires in California and other states; and severe winter weather in northern states."
"In addition, we maintain business continuity plans to ensure the continuity of critical processes."
Crisis management.
"Our incident and crisis management structure includes escalation and notification protocols, as well as senior management engagement from the local level to the C-suite."
"This structure has been employed for events including hurricanes, major security incidents and the COVID-19 pandemic."
Training and exercising.
Incident and crisis management teams are routinely trained in process and tools.
We use tabletop exercises and drills to assess the efficacy of our plans and identify any gaps.
The Business Resilience & Crisis Management program involves: 50 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix Description Potential impacts Mitigation efforts Physical risks Risks associated with increasing frequency and severity of storms and other extreme weather events.
"Increased costs due to weather damage to company assets, business interruption, customer and supply chain impacts, and employee disruptions."
"Managed through the BRCM program and includes expenditures to make our facilities more resilient to severe storm events, as well as insurance coverage."
"Regulatory risks Risks associated with emerging climate and energy regulation such as carbon pricing, emission restrictions and energy taxes."
Increased operation and compliance costs.
"Ongoing efforts to reduce energy consumption and decarbonize our facilities through efficiency projects, equipment updates, facility modernization and renewable energy."
"Market/technology risks and opportunitiesRisks associated with increased demand for offerings focused on climate change, transitioning to lower emission technologies for our products, including potential decrease in demand for certain existing products, and our dependence on suppliers and government actions, etc., as well as the risk that competitors develop solutions that gain acceptance before we do."
"Significant investment and investigation of new technologies, alternative power sources, new materials and airframe structures, and different fuel and energy storage."
"Strategic planning efforts, development of technology roadmaps and increased R&D funding for sustainable technologies and other measures."
Monitoring climate change from above Several RI&S technologies are already being used to help meet the demand for improved data and analysis relating to climate data and weather forecasting.
"They include: EVI-5 GLIMR (Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer) Designed to closely monitor the health of our oceans and assess risks for coastal communities to protect both our environment and our economy, this instrument is being used in a new NASA mission."
"It will provide unique observations of ocean biology, chemistry and ecology in the Gulf of Mexico, portions of the southeastern U."
"S. coastline and the Amazon River plume, where the Amazon enters the Atlantic."
"MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) This system, which is flying on NASA Earth Observation System (EOS) satellites Aqua and Terra, helps scientists determine the amount of water vapor in a column of the atmosphere and the vertical distribution of temperature and water vapor measurements crucial to understanding Earths climate system."
"VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) Using VIIRS data, scientists can measure cloud and atmospheric particle properties, ocean color, sea and land surface temperature, ice motion and temperature, fires and the amount of sunlight reflected from the Earths surface."
There are two VIIRS on orbit as part of the Joint Polar Satellite System for NASA and NOAA.
Three additional VIIRSs are on order for continuity of observations.
TWICC (Theater Weather Imaging and Cloud Characterization) Being built for the U.
"S. Space Force to replace the aging DOD Meteorological Satellite Program satellites, TWICC will provide critical environmental sensing to the U."
"S. and its allies, as well as shared continuity of observations to NASA and NOAA."
Climate risk analysis We participate in the voluntary global GHG disclosure system called CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) and respond to its annual climate questionnaire.
"Our comprehensive response in 2021 earned a score of A-, the best score received in our industry."
Only three peer companies received the same score.
"* CDPs detailed climate questionnaire addresses issues of governance, climate strategy, climate risks and opportunities, GHG emissions, accounting methodologies and goals."
It incorporates all the reporting elements from the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
(See Appendix for TCFD Index.)
"As part of the assessment and disclosure process, we have identified three general types of climate-related risks to which we are subject: physical, regulatory and market/technology risks."
"To further understand our risk and opportunities, we use climate-related scenario analysis."
"For example, we modeled multiple climate scenarios published by the International Energy Agency, including one that limits global warming increase to 1.5 degree Celsius over various time horizons."
"In addition, we included several relevant climate-related drivers specific to our commercial aviation business."
We also considered the scenario analysis that was conducted by ATAG and described in its Waypoint 2050 report.
Climate-related risks are influencing our business strategies and financial planning.
"This is particularly evident in commercial aviation, where innovation is critical to respond to the climate crisis and to meet the aviation sectors net-zero goal."
"As described in On the path to decarbonize aviation, we are focused on creating more sustainable technologies and products, such as improved engine efficiency, new propulsion systems and advanced structures and materials."
"Additionally, we are making significant investments in sustainable technologies and developing technology roadmaps for high-priority technology areas."
"We are pursuing efforts to respond to and mitigate these risks to the extent possible:** * C ore A&D peers include: Airbus, Boeing, General Electric, General Dynamics, Honeywell, L3Harris, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Safran."
"** See Raytheon T echnologies CDP disclosure for more information.51 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix Saving water, drop by drop Collins reduced water consumption by implementing numerous water projects in 2021, including: In Figeac, France, a new system for demineralized water production was implemented."
"Water is treated and then used for production water, providing a savings of 260,000 gallons."
"In addition, water consumption software was installed for real-time connection of water meters to continuously monitor different water uses, diagnose leaks faster and determine water consumption kinetics and peak flow rates."
This information will allow us to identify and define future projects to reduce water consumption.
"In Monroe, North Carolina, irrigation optimization helped to promote the intelligent use of water, including segregating the site into zones based on exposure, implementing drought tolerant plants, grouping low and high-water-use plants, using moisture sensors and precision nozzles and improving scheduling."
"The projects resulted in a savings of nearly 46,000 gallons."
"As stewards of our environment, we are committed to driving pollutants in our manufacturing processes to the lowest achievable levels and conserving natural resources in the design, manufacture, use and disposal of our products and the delivery of our services."
This commitment is part of how we operate and has been for decades.
"Similar to our GHG emission reduction goals, we have set goals for reducing our water consumption and reducing waste sent to landfills and incineration, the two most environmentally harmful disposal methods."
All of these efforts are organized under the EH&S Management System.
"At each site, we establish an EH&S Committee, which develops an annual EH&S plan that addresses activities to support their goals and targets and identifies necessary resources."
"Water consumption in 2021 was 19% less than our 2019 baseline, though usage was artificially low due to the effects of COVID-19 on commercial aviation and employees working from home."
We anticipate consumption to increase in the next year or two.
"In addition, by the end of 2021 we implemented 50% of our water best management practices, well ahead of our 2021 goal."
Water BMPs are proven processes and initiatives that will help reduce water consumption.
"They include forming a site water team, developing a leak management plan and enhanced cooling tower management."

The site runs a surplus office supply reuse and donation program as part of a comprehensive waste reduction and recycling program.
"In 2021, the site donated more than 2.5 tons of surplus office supplies, furniture and electronics, including 160 computer monitors, to local schools and nonprofit organizations."
This program supports both waste reduction and important community organizations.
Managing our waste We are strategically reducing the amount of waste we send to landfills and incinerators.
"In 2021, we reduced the amount by 24% from our 2019 baseline, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills and incineration by 8,095 tons."
"In 2021, the amount of waste sent to landfills and incineration was 26,325 tons."
"To achieve this progress, we are focusing on minimizing waste generation; increasing recycling by improving waste segregation and finding additional recycling outlets; reusing materials where we can to extend their useful life; and expanding food composting at our facilities."
"Our sites are making good progress in implementing our waste BMPs, well ahead of our 2021 goal."
"In 2021, we implemented 56% of them."
Waste BMPs are proven practices that will help sites reduce waste and improve recycling rates.
"They include a detailed waste assessment, development of a recycling plan and a container management plan, and coolant recycling requirements."
"In addition, in the U."
"S. 20 of our facilities in nine states have earned the zero-waste certification Total Resource Use and Efficiency (TRUE), which is managed by the Green Business Certification, Inc."
"TRUE is a rigorous certification that requires extensive recycling and reuse practices, mature waste management programs and active employee participation, as well as passing a third-party audit."
The sites are required to meet program requirements annually to maintain the certification.
"RMDs Tewksbury, Massachusetts, location was the first aerospace and defense manufacturing site to be certified (in 2014), and in early 2020 RI&S McKinney facility became the first site in Texas to receive a platinum rating."
"Many of our hazardous waste streams are not suited for recycling and reclamation and instead require treatment, incineration or some other manner of proper disposal."
"We periodically evaluate new technologies for waste reduction, recycling and reclamation that could be used to reduce our hazardous waste disposal volumes."
We experienced no release of CERCLA hazardous substances in an amount equal to or greater than the reportable quantity identified in the U.

"In a circular economy, every organization and individual that touches a given product seeks to reduce material use, redesign materials to be less resource intensive and recapture waste as a resource for reuse."
"We apply this mentality in several ways across the organization, including the entire manufacturing and product life cycle: Maintaining a components useful lifespan."
"Our maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) shops focus on reworking parts to keep them flying and in productive use as long as possible."
"For example, Pratt & Whitney engines are in the air for 15 years or more, undergoing multiple required and regularly scheduled maintenance and performance restoration shop visits over the engines service life."
These shop visits prolong the service life and keep the engine operating at specification.
Reusing and recycling materials.
We look for ways to reuse materials to extend their useful life and recycle materials at the end of their useful function.
"For example, an oil recycling system was installed at the Collins Saint-Marcel, France, actuation facility, and the site was able to reuse 1,500 liters of oil last year, eliminating over 3,000 pounds of hazardous waste."
"Likewise, the Collins Fort Worth, Texas, Landing Systems Service Center installed a wastewater filtration system that turned 23,000 gallons of oily wastewater into useable wash water for cleaning aircraft wheels avoiding the need to transport it off site for treatment and reducing the sites hazardous waste generation by 75%."
Recycling components so they can be reconstituted and used again.
"The Pratt & Whitney scrap and revert team focuses on managing scrap parts, capturing strategic revert alloys, protecting Pratt & Whitney technology and improving sustainability while decreasing costs."
The teams efforts have yielded more than 4 million pounds of scrap metal recycled from September 2020 through September 2021.
"Additionally, over 2.4 million pounds of input material was reverted back to the supplier to be turned into new castings for production."
"In addition, the Collins MRO facilities recycle end-of-life products, reclaiming and refurbishing appropriate components to keep them out of landfills and extend their on-wing life."
"Intertrade, a Collins-owned company, buys, refurbishes, brokers and sells used aircraft components."
"In 2021, Intertrade refurbished and sold 232 tons of aircraft products, extending their life and keeping them out of landfills."
"53 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix IAEG recognition In 2021, five Raytheon Technologies employees were recognized by the International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG) for their outstanding contributions to IAEG and for supporting efficiency and effectiveness, strategic development and customer value."
"All five of the companys winners support our GCS program, working across business units and functions to support compliance and reduce risk across product design, sourcing, manufacturing, product delivery, product services and end-of-life considerations."
"We use a variety of chemicals, chemical formulations and materials to manufacture complex parts and components and to assemble, maintain and service our products."
"We have an active and integrated Global Chemical Substances (GCS) program to comply with global chemical substance requirements, understand our reliance on such chemicals and minerals."
"We strive to reduce adverse impacts to human health and environment, as well as potential business disruption risk."
"The GCS program monitors and tracks global chemical regulations and identifies their potential impacts, including recognition that regulatory changes could require changes in our operations, sourcing processes and/or production methods."
The GCS program is a cross-functional collaboration principally between our Engineering and Operations & Supply Chain teams.
"The GCS program reports monthly to the corporate EH&S vice president, and the GCS Executive Committee (GCSEC) conducts periodic cross-functional reviews, co-chaired by the Corporate vice presidents of EH&S and Engineering."
"GCSEC members include vice presidents from supply chain, operations, quality, legal, and research and development."
"In the context of EU REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals), our program activity includes participation in multiple authorization consortia."
"We use internal, supply chain, trade association and other sources of chemical substance dependency information to identify associated risks for chemical substances deemed to be of concern."
"We apply strategies that target use-reduction opportunities, as well as alternatives development, selection and deployment."
"Critical minerals In 2021, we began an enterprisewide study to identify our dependence on a larger group of critical minerals and review their sources."
"Its a complex endeavor, given that we are not a primary processor; instead, we purchase finished and semi-finished metal products."
"For example, we use cobalt in specialty wear-resistant coatings used in aircraft parts; gallium in high-power GaN devices used in radars; chromium in high-temperature alloys in jet engines; and rare earth elements in high-strength permanent magnets in aircraft and missile actuator motors."
"Magnesium is a constituent of many common aluminum alloys used in a wide variety of structural applications in aircraft, missiles, and ground and sea-based shelters and enclosures."
Each of our business units is currently identifying dependence on critical minerals in products and processes.
The results of this study will help us define our future priorities and manage related risks.
Pratt & Whitney uses advanced alloy systems that contain a variety of these critical minerals.
"For many years, it has employed various means to manage the risks associated with potential disruptions, including stockpiling and long-term sourcing contracts."
Reducing risks of chemical usage 54 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix Flying toward a chromate- free future Raytheon Technologies has been working toward eliminating the use of chromates for decades.
"These chemical compounds are often applied to aerospace and defense parts to help prevent metal corrosion, increase wear resistance and improve adhesive bonding."
"However, chromates pose environmental and health risks."
"Complete substitution of chromates is challenging because they provide unique performance in a wide range of applications and need a wide range of substitutes, each of which rrequire extensive evaluation, testing, qualification, customer approval and certification by various global governmental agencies."
All four of our business units are making steady progress in reducing our dependence on this class of chemicals.
"For example, Collins has qualified a chromate-free surface pretreatment solution to repair metal bond aircraft body components."
We are actively engaged with suppliers and industry groups to develop more chromate-free bond primers that will create a complete chromate-free protection system for bonded metal structures for select substrates and applications.
These efforts build on the success of the chromate-free landing gear primer we debuted in 2018.
This solution is more environmentally friendly than the products that are currently in use and meets the EUs REACH regulations.
"In 2021, Pratt & Whitney modified a design specification, removing hexavalent chrome sealing from a sulfuric acid anodizing process for aluminum parts."
This accomplishment was the end result of a long-term effort to qualify and fully industrialize the non-chromate alternative for this commonly used process.
"RI&S and RM&D have implemented various alternatives, including the use of trivalent chromium conversion coating on many aluminum structures."
These efforts culminated in the first major system designed to be fully chromate free.
"55 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix The Raytheon Technologies Environment, Health and Safety (EH&S) Policy establishes the core tenets of our EH&S program, including being stewards of our environment, continuously improving our processes and programs, and promoting employee awareness and participation."
(See our policy statement.)
"The policy identifies key oversight, compliance and procedural responsibilities for senior management, including the CEO."
"The senior vice presidents of operations, supply chain, quality and EH&S and the vice president of EH&S oversee our EH&S efforts."
"They report on the progress of the EH&S program to the CEO every quarter, and to the Governance and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors at least once per year."
"The EH&S Management System is the cornerstone of our EH&S program and organizes the elements of the EH&S program into an efficient mechanism for compliance with EH&S laws and regulations, as well as company requirements."
It also enables our belief in continual improvement.
The system was developed using key elements from ISO 14001 (environmental management) and other management system standards.
Overseeing environmental compliance Environmental compliance Compliance remains a foundational priority.
We regularly assess our operating locations for compliance with regulatory requirements and risk management issues.
"The findings from these assessments are tracked until they are closed, and management is informed of the program results."
The Management System provides tools for identifying and systematically managing EH&S impacts associated with our activities.
"It defines roles and responsibilities, allowing operations to effectively plan and manage EH&S programs."
Sites continually identify and assess environmental hazards and risks and employ strategies to manage and mitigate them.
"We conduct tiered compliance audits and engage outside auditors to monitor our environmental, health and safety compliance."
We conduct root-cause analyses to ensure appropriate corrective and preventive actions are taken in response to any incidents or deficiencies that we identify.
We communicate with and train our employees to ensure they are aware of environmental and safety issues and requirements.
"For more information on health and safety oversight, refer to the Protecting employee health and safety section of this report."

"We are committed to engaging with all areas of our supply chain to ensure we use quality, responsibly sourced materials in our products."
"Our efforts start at the top, where supply chain compliance is led by the senior vice president, operations and supply chain, who briefs the Board of Directors on supply chain matters annually."
"Members of the enterprisewide Raytheon Technologies Supply Chain Council and Quality Council, as well as the Contracts and Legal organizations also provide oversight for supply chain matters."
Decisions and processes are then filtered down to each business unit and every supplier through our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Quality Policy.
Our standard terms and conditions of purchase require suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
"In addition, they require suppliers to adopt and comply with a code of conduct or policy statement regarding business conduct, ethics, and compliance that satisfies, at a minimum, the principles set forth in our Supplier Code of Conduct."
"Among other things, the Supplier Code requires all suppliers to conduct operations in a manner that: Complies with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and directives."
Actively manages risk.
Conserves natural resources.
Prevents pollution.
Safeguards the environment.
"Minimizes waste, emissions and energy consumption."
"To cascade this impact throughout our supply chain, our Supplier Code requires each of our suppliers to, among other things, have management systems, tools and processes to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the requirements contained in the Supplier Code."
"To help achieve these outcomes, we actively engage with our suppliers."
We provide onboarding training to new strategic suppliers and communicate with existing suppliers as needed.
We continue to innovate and are developing a supplier sustainability plan to engage with and assess the programs and performance of our supply base.

59 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix The quality and safety of our products are essential to our business and a focus for all Raytheon Technologies activities.
"Our promise to our customers and their end users is straightforward: We design, manufacture, service and maintain safe products that meet or exceed all applicable government standards, industry regulations and customer requirements for safety and product quality."
"To ensure we fulfill that promise, we have built a proactive culture that prioritizes product safety and quality across the organization, starting with our CEO and Board of Directors."
Product safety is among the key risks identified under our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program.
"We have established processes for regular reviews with the GPPC on product safety matters, including incident metrics and managed safety issues, as well as for immediate reporting in the event of significant product safety incidents."
"Our product safety programs and goals are overseen by the corporate product safety officer (PSO), who is supported by Raytheon Technologies executive leadership."
"The president of each business unit is responsible for the overall safety of products designed, produced or maintained by their business and appoints a business unit PSO to execute a product safety management system (SMS)."
"Our core product safety teams meet eight to 10 times a year for safety-related discussions, best practice sharing and activities related to safety culture."
"All of our products and services, across business units, are assessed for safety performance and continuous improvements."
Our focus on safety and quality starts when our products are just a concept.
"We apply military and commercial safety system methods consistent with military standards and commercial aerospace recommended practices, as well as aerospace standards for quality, throughout the design process."
"To reduce product safety and quality risk, we establish design requirements to avoid or minimize risks using safety assessment tools, including: Design failure mode effects analysis, which determines what might go wrong with a given product design, how critical the failure may be and how to prevent or mitigate the risk or the likelihood of occurrence."
"Process failure mode effects analysis, which takes the same approach to manufacturing processes and quality controls."
"Safety hazard analysis, which identifies potential hazards associated with product failure or misuse, the criticality of those hazards, the mitigation or control of those hazards and the verification of the hazard controls."
"Failure mode effects and criticality analysis, a data-driven approach to risk assessment."
"Proactive approaches to quality, such as employing AS9145 requirements for advanced product quality planning and production part approval process."
"Raytheon Technologies multiple SMS solutions govern all of our products and parts from production to the use phase, ensuring they meet or exceed the regulatory requirements of the FAA, Transport Canada (TC), the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and other relevant agencies."
"Each SMS provides clear accountability, with explicit policy statements from leadership on product safety goals and objectives."
"Our commitment to product safety, quality and transparency Raytheon Technologies product safety program objectives Promotion of continual improvement in our safety culture, processes and products."
"Full employee awareness of SMS policies, processes and tools relevant to their responsibilities."
"Enterprisewide responsiveness to, and open reporting of, identified safety hazards."
"Proactive identification and management of safety-critical parts, features and manufacturing controls."
Implementation of safety risk controls to acceptable risk levels.

S. Navy / SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific under Contract No.
"N66001-11-C-4053.In consideration of the 2021 ERM program and its risk oversight role, the Board of Directors recently amended the charter of the Governance and Public Policy Committee (GPPC) to confirm the Committees oversight responsibility for company product safety risks (with the Special Activities Committee assisting on classified product safety)."
60 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix Ensuring product safety We focus on safety throughout the life cycle of Raytheon Technologies products and services including after they are delivered to our customers.
Our business units practices and procedures include: A Product Safety Incident Review Board that meets twice annually to review significant safety-related issues across the four business units.
"Extensive data management tools to report, monitor and track corrective actions for product safety issues and hazards, including significant safety-related events."
Safety training programs for employees and contractors.
Emergency response and accident investigation protocols.
"This approach benefits our employees, customers and business."
"For instance, in 2021 both the FAA and TC formally acknowledged the Pratt & Whitney SMS for meeting the intent of U."
S. and international SMS standards.
"The FAA is also reviewing our Product Safety Community of Practice (COP) program at Collins Aerospace, which enhances our processes and capabilities for safety risk analysis and management."
"The COP accomplished the generation of realizable standard work, documenting best practices and establishing standards that address important elements of safety risk analysis and assessment methods."
"For their work leading this effort, two Collins employees received Raytheon Technologies 2021 Product Safety Award."
"At Raytheon Intelligence & Space (RI&S), our product safety protocols include performing robust system safety assessments prior to program startup, including identification of potential hazards and proactive implementation of mitigation strategies to reduce the safety risks of our future fielded products."
The team promotes our product safety culture by proactively holding safety awareness employee events and communicating the importance of a safety-first mindset.
"For example, Raytheon UK recently implemented an EH&S awareness campaign, Safety for Everyone (SaFE), to remind all employees of the importance of product safety and near miss reporting, and to stop and speak up if they see potential safety issues."
"Another illustration of RI&Ss superior safety culture is demonstrated by the Raytheon Multi-program Testbed flight team, which received praise from customers for fully implementing an FAA Safety Management System that enabled safely executing 55 test missions in 2021, including a highly successful deployment to the Northern Edge exercise in Alaska.61 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES ESG REPORT 2021 01 Introduction 02 Commitment 03 People 04 Planet 05 Principles 06 Appendix Product quality Raytheon Technologies is committed to achieving competitive excellence and providing our customers with products and services that meet or exceed our quality representations and requirements."
"We strive to accomplish this objective by continually improving our people and our processes, sharing best practices across our business units and throughout our supply chain, and promoting an ethical culture."
"The Raytheon Technologies Quality Council, which includes senior Quality and Mission Assurance leaders from each business unit and the corporate function, meets regularly to share best practices, collaborates on continual improvement initiatives, oversees the Quality Management System (QMS) activity in the business units and aligns all on our enterprise quality policies."
"Each of our business units must have a documented QMS to ensure compliance with customer, statutory, regulatory and industry requirements."
All of our facilities and sites that provide products and services must be compliant with an industry QMS standard that is appropriate to the product or service delivered at that site.
We demonstrate that compliance through internal QMS audits and third-party certification of our QMS.
"Our QMS processes meet or exceed current industry standards and are maintained and audited through a rigorous, tiered approach."
"These audits may include the supply chain, where suppliers may be audited for compliance based on risk."
Our first-tier suppliers may be required to flow these same requirements to all levels of the supply chain.
"For example, we control age-dated materials via regularly scheduled product and process verification conducted in our factories and our suppliers factories."
"We may also control these materials, depending on product risk, via a positive recall system with less frequent audits on the overall system performance."
"The QMS auditing process for Raytheon Technologies is a competitive differentiator, in that we use the QMS Advanced Surveillance Recertification Program (ASRP) within several of our business units."
"Collins, RI&S and Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) operate according to the ASRP requirements, a demanding process that few companies opt to undertake."
"Pratt & Whitney is working toward ASRP certification, building on the best practices identified by the other business units."
ASRP requirements go above and beyond the standard internal audit program.
"Rather than the standard QMS audit once per year by the certification body, we use a more robust and rigorous system of internal tiered audits, including those at the site, business and enterprise levels."
ASRP enables and encourages cross-site and cross-business trending and data sharing to promote increased responsiveness.
"An independent third party audits each participating site on a reduced frequency, with increased emphasis on the internal auditing processes and effectiveness of the Enterprise Audit Team."
ASRP is a rigorous and demanding audit process that is difficult to attain.
"The rigor of ASRP supports our commitment to product quality: In third-party certification audits, ASRP companies have significantly fewer major nonconformances in key areas than non-ASRP companies."

We also operate a due diligence program focused on identifying and mitigating human rights risks associated with potential product sales.
The Human Rights Council developed the framework for this program and each business unit is responsible for embedding controls in its operations to screen potential sales involving certain types of products in countries that present higher risk of human rights violations from product misuse.
"The Council is charged with periodically reviewing the results of these screenings, and working with the business units on specific sales opportunities that may present heightened human rights risks."
Raytheon Technologies is committed to respecting human rights.
"This commitment is delineated in our Code of Conduct and embedded in both our culture and our values of trust, respect, accountability, collaboration and innovation."
Respect for human rights is a core operating principle for all of our people and our business units globally.
"The Raytheon Technologies Human Rights Council is responsible for overseeing company processes, policies and practices to identify, assess and address human rights risks."
"The Council, which we launched in 2021, is composed of leaders across multiple functions and each of our business units."
"During 2021, the Council developed our new enterprise Human Rights Policy based on legacy company policies and practices."
"The policy articulates our commitment to respect and protect human rights and sets forth the principles we expect our business units and employees, as well as our customers, suppliers and other partners, to uphold."
"We monitor and evaluate our impact on human rights through due diligence and other measures, and take actions designed to mitigate such impact."
"Our Code of Conduct, company policies, and ethics and compliance training reinforce our commitment to safe and healthy working conditions and zero tolerance for discrimination, harassment and child or forced labor."
Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the standards to which we hold our suppliers and third-party providers.
Our suppliers are also required to adhere to the standards set forth in our Modern Slavery and Conflict Minerals policy statements.
"For more information on our supplier due diligence activities, see Supplier quality, environment, health and safety matters."
"To reinforce our expectations, we have a robust conflict minerals compliance program that employs a risk-based due diligence process based on an internationally recognized framework, and we participate in industry initiatives to raise awareness of responsible sourcing of conflict minerals."
