"Because as significant as COVID -19 is, its not the only challenge our world faces."
"Climate change presents environmental, social, and economic crises on a whole new level."
For nearly two millennia humans have been carbonizing our planet and we need to act together to decarbonize.
"Our first annual sustainability report, released in January 2021, showed early progress on our commitments to become a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030 and protect ecosystems by building a Planetary Computer."
2021 was a year of both successes and challenges.
"While we continued to make progress on several of our goals, with an overall reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased year over year, due in substantial part to significant global datacenter expansions and the growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the pandemic."
"A closer look at 2021 During our most recent fiscal year, we grew business revenue by 20 percent while continuing to reduce our operational emissions, as represented by Scope 1 and 2 combined, with a decrease of approximately 17 percent through our purchasing of renewable energy."
"However, as our business has grown and weve seen increased use of our devices and cloud services, our total Scope 3 emissions (comprising the companys entire value chain) have increased by about 23 percent year-over-year."
"These emissions include, among other things, the carbon emitted from electricity generation to power devices at home or at work and for producing the concrete and steel we use in construction."
"We work to limit these emissions when we design and manufacture our products, and work with our suppliers to report and reduce their emissionsbut still saw an increase."
This serves as an important reminder that Scope 3 emissions are the most difficult to control and reduce.
This year has highlighted the challenges of reducing Scope 3 emissions and were committed to sharing our learnings to help other organizations who are wrestling with these same challenges.
One Scope 3 category that saw an annual increase was capital equipment.
This category includes the emissions to produce equipment we bought this year (and will use for a long time) as well as the carbon emissions associated with the construction of new buildings including both datacenters and office space.
"For example, as the Microsoft Cloud business expands, construction of new datacenters and new server equipment is needed to support growing customer demand."
The emissions associated with the capital equipment category accounted for about 30 percent of our Scope 3 total this year.
"Another Scope 3 category that saw an increase was the use of our products, specifically the estimated emissions associated with powering products we sold including Xbox and Surface devices."
This category accounted for about 29 percent of our Scope 3 total this year.
"Around the world, the electricity used to power devices today largely comes from grids reliant on carbon-intensive sources such as coal or gas, so Microsoft must account for that carbon for the lifetime of our devices to accurately track our Scope 3 emissions."
"And, because every part of the world has a different mix of electricity generation sources, we calculate a devices climate impact based on where the device was sold."
"The journey to net zero Despite these Scope 3 increases, we remain dedicated to building a world better than the one we found, and to helping our customers and partners achieve the same."
"The impact of this work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience this year highlights a few takeaways relevant to many organizations executing against their sustainability commitments."
1.
Progress wont always be linear.
"The rate at which we can implement emissions reductions is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time, ranging from our own business growth and supplier mix to the rate of growth of green infrastructure, such as the supply of and transition speed to renewable energy."
"Additionally, different sources of emissions will be addressed on different time frames as climate technologies and renewable alternatives advance."
"And as measurement methodologies improve and new standards emerge, companies like ours may see emissions rise or fall year-over-year."
"Nonetheless, the challenge remains: we must continuously improve on our efforts to decouple our emissions from our growth until we reach our carbon negative commitment in 2030."
"Some of this will happen through the completion of specific goals such as our shift to a 100 percent electric campus vehicle fleet, our move away from diesel fuel as a backup energy source for our datacenters, and the carbon benefits of our waste reduction improvements due to our expanding fleet of Circular Centers."
"Other progress will happen through the expansion of our renewable energy purchasing program to cover the energy consumption of our consumer devices, through advances by our suppliers in reducing their own emissions, and through increased purchasing of new materials as they enter the markets, including green steel, low carbon concrete, and other infrastructure components of a future net zero carbon economy."
4 Foreword (continued) 2.Progress relies on us all counting carbon consistently.
There a re several external factors or bugs in the worlds net zero carbon program thatif addressed will help us all make greater progresstoward our net zero goals.
"The world lacks a commonmeaning of the term net zero and a common unit of measurement for assessing the climate impact ofvarious net zero approaches, and we must all focus onmaturing the markets needed to achieve a net zerocarbon economy by 2050."
We explored these topicsin greater detail through t he lens of our work on carbon removal.
W e will continue to inn ovate and invest to meet our ambitious commitments and well do so in a principled way.
"We will also continue to be transparent about our progress, our challenges, and our learnings to help others on their journey."
"As we look to the future we are committed to: Counting everything, including challenging Scope 3 emissions."
"We are putt ing programs in place to help lower them, from working with our sup pliers to help them decarbonize to continuing to innovate withour company-wide internal carbon tax to incentivizeemissions reduction and continuing to invest incarbon removal."
Only investing in carbon removal offsets instead oftraditional avoid ed emissions offsets because removal is an underdeveloped and critical tool to solve theworlds climate challenge.
You can only get to netzero when youve reduced all that you can and yourremaining carbon emissions are completely balancedby long-term carbon removal.
"Last year, we madethe worlds largest purchase of carbon r emoval at 1.4 million metric tons and in this fiscal year we are ontrack to top that by procuring 1.5 million metric tons."
"From pledges to progress While 2021 presented us with some new learnings, weve also made some great progress that we share in more detail in this report."
A few examples that illuminate the diversity of our work include the following.
"Four datacenters are Zero Waste certified, with new certifications for the San Antonio, Texas and Quincy,Washington datacenters and renewed certifications forour Boydton, Virginia and Dublin, Ireland locations."
"We announced the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainabilityto provide comprehensive, integrated, and automatedsustainability management for organizations at anystage of the sustainability journey."
"Through an investment from our Climate InnovationFund, were helping LanzaJet complete theirsustainable fuels plant in Georgiaa move thatwill help decarbonize our datacenters as well as theairline industry."
"While overall device emissions grew because of highersales and usage, we reduced the carbon footprintfor several of our products."
"Surface Pro 8 is one ofthe most energy efficient Surface Pros ever and weintroduced Energy Saver, a new low-power standbymode for Xbox consoles."
"We granted $100 million to Breakthrough Ene rgy Catalyst to accelerate the development of climate solutions the world needs to reach net-zero across fourkey areas: direct air capture, green hydrogen, longduration energy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel."
"We are committed to becoming a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by 2030."
"With net zero becom i ng the new normalmore than 1,500 companies with to tal net revenue of $11.4 trillion have pledged that they will become carbon neutral or net zerothe world must move from climate pledges to climate progress."
"As a leading technology provider of sustainable solutions, Microsoft stands ready to support our customers, partners, and the world in the move towards a net zero, environmentally sustainable future."
"And while the shape of what the future holds is unknown, we will continue to build the foundations needed today and do the work that needs to be done to deliver on our commitments."
Its what the world needs us all to do.
"Brad Smith President and Vic e Chair Dr. Lucas Joppa Chi ef Environmental Officer 5 2021 progress $571M Allocated $471 million to date via our Climate Innovation Fund to accelerate our carbon goals, as well as water and waste."
We also donated $100 million to Breakthrough Energys Catalyst initiative.
"6 Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems 2.5M tons In FY21 and FY22, Microsoft successfully contracted to remove 2.5 million mtCO 2, meeting our cumulative two-year goal."
"1.3M m In FY21, Microsoft invested in replenishment projects that are expected to generate over 1.3 million cubic meters of volumetric benefits."
"Circular Centers We have planned five Circular Centers, with Amsterdam open, construction underway in Boydton, Virginia, and three more to be added in 2022."
"> 17,000 acres In FY21, we contracted to protect more than 17,000 acres of land."
"5.8 GW In FY21, we signed new power purchase agreements (PPAs) for approximately 5.8 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy across 10 countries around the globe."
670M Our programs with Water.org account for over 670 million liters9 of water benefit per year.
">15, 20 0 tons In FY21, we diverted more than 15,200 metric tons of solid waste otherwise headed to landfills and incinerators."
">500 users The Planetary Computer private preview released as planned in April 2021, with more than 500 users signed up and using the APIs and scalable compute."
"87% supplier reporting In July 2021, 87 percent of our in-scope suppliers reported their emissions to CDP, up 12 percent from 2020."
">95K people Through our partnership with Water.org , we provided more than 95,00010 people with access to safe water or sanitation."
"Zero Waste Four datacenters are Zero Waste certified, with new certifications for the San Antonio, Texas and Quincy."
"24 petabytes We have made available 24 petabytes of data with more than 30 key environmental and Earth observation datasets to Azure in consistent, analysis-ready format that is freely available for use by anyone."
"Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability In July 2021, we launched the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability to provide comprehensive, integrated, and automated sustainability management."
U.S.
"Water Prize In 2021, Microsoft was awarded the U."
S. Water Prize for Outstanding Private Sector Organization for adopting our water positive program and committing to being water positive by 2030.
18% reduction We reduced single-use plastics in our Microsoft product packaging by 18 percent.
"850+ grants Since its inception in 2017, our AI for Earth program has provided more than 850 grants to organizations working in 110 countries around the world, granting more than $20 million in Azure credits."
"How we work Make it central to the business while making it relevant at business group levels Set the tone from the top Hold everyone accountable for progress and a governance structure to track progress in real time Take steps to accelerate markets, ecosystems, and global progress Scale strategy to achieve ambitions by using the whole of the business Set ambitions based on the science Report on everything, not just progress Microsofts commitments to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030 while building a Planetary Computer are well known."
"To guide the progress across the company on those goals, we have changed the way our sustainability strategy and accountabilities are set and how progress is evaluated."
"In the interest of transparency and also to help other organizations get started, we are sharing how we work first, prior to our commitments and progress on themsustainable digital transformations require both strategic frameworks and cultural buy-in to be successful."
Set ambitions based on the science The best available science and policy indicate that every organization needs to do even more in far less time than previously thought.
"As we saw the science in 2019, it was clear that our carbon neutral goal was not what the world neededthe world needs to reach net zero by or before 2050."
"That meant we needed to set goals aligned to the science and language of the science, and we needed to be more ambitious."
"In 2020, we made a series of environmental sustainability commitments, including being carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030."
"Scale strategy to achieve ambitions by using the whole of the business At Microsoft, we think about the positions of influence that we can use."
"We start by taking accountability for our operations as a company, but we expand this significantly as we think about the different roles that we play as a customer, supplier, investor, employer, policy advocate, and partner in innovation to customers, organizations, and institutions around the world."
The challenge is to find where our organization can have the most impact across our positions of influence.
"Microsoft looked at our commitments based on our operation a l footprint across carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems, the technology that we provide to our customers and partners to power their sustainability initiatives, and larger influence that we can have on the world with research, investments, strategic partnerships, and policy and advocacy."
Set the tone from the top Sustainability is no longer just a corporate social responsibility (CSR) function or a way to mitigate riskit must be mainstreamed into every part of the business.
That starts with making sustainability part of the brand commitment and embraced by all leaders.
"At the heart of our culture is the understanding that for Microsoft to do well, we need the world to do well and that we are a company that pursues profit by solving the problems of people and the planet."
"This belief is deeply held by the leadership of Microsoftthe CEO, CFO, and Presidentthe entire company sees the commitment and it sets the tone across the company that sustainability is at the core of our business."
"Make it central to the business while making it relevant at business group levels Corporate commitments give your company a north star, but you need to embed the strategy and build operational commitments across your business."
"At Microsoft, we knew we needed a way to implement and execute on our strategy across the entire company, in every business group."
"For each focus area (carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems), we set commitments in each business group and developed roadmaps to reach these commitments."
"We are also committed to enabling our suppliers with capacity-building tools and resources, as well as sustainable supply chain financing."
How we work 7 How we work (continued) Hold everyone accountable for progress and a governance structure to track progress in real time Governance and accountability are critical to ensuring alignment and prioritization across your business.
"At Microsoft, we hold our business groups accountable for their carbon emissions via an internal carbon fee of $15 per metric ton."
"In January 2021, we expanded the carbon fee so that it includes Scope 3 emissions from our supply and value chain, in addition to Scope 1 and Scope 2."
We set measurements and scorecards for each business groups sustainability commitments across the company and review progress twice a year.
"We have established a Climate Council that includes senior business leaders from every business group to provide sustainability advice, collaborate, drive alignment, prioritize resources and funding, and review progress on our commitments."
We also tie a portion of our executive incentive plan to our carbon reduction goals.
"Take steps to accelerate markets, ecosystems, and global progress If the world is going to meet net zero goals by 2050, companies need to use their entire ecosystem and all of their positions of influence."
"In addition to taking accountability for our operational footprint across carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems, Microsoft is deploying capital, supporting innovation, and advocating for larger policy change."
"We led the largest corporate carbon removal RFP last year, spending our dollars to drive the carbon removal market forward and to address our own needs."
"Our $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund is investing in organizations across our areas of commitment to build a larger, more robust ecosystem of effective companies and solutions."
"Our sponsorship at COP26 and numerous engagements with governments at the city, regional, state, and national levels are aimed at creating policy environments that further accelerate the impact of this work and the transition to net zero."
"Report on everything, not just progress Transparency is both embedded in each step and a specific commitment."
"In this report, as well as other white papers, methodology papers, and speaking engagements, Microsoft is committed to sharing our learnings with the world."
"When things go well, we will share that as well as the playbooks to follow to achieve similar results outside our organization."
"And if things go less well, we will share that too so we can all learn and grow together."
We are also delivering innovative technology and services to help our customers and partners power environmental sustainability.
"And we go beyond that with our biggest bets in policy, investment, catalytic partnerships, and research and development."
Sustainable digital transformations require both strategic frameworks and cultural buy-in to be successful.
8 Employee engagement Feature story Empowering our global workforce We recognize that our employees are the most important asset and resource in advancing innovation in sustainability and are creating opportunities for them to contribute to our efforts.
Empowering our global workforce is the center of our sustainability strategy.

"42 Resources 43 -15 Our approach A commitment to a carbon negative futureThe context The consequences of climate change are increasingly apparent, from wildfires to devastating flooding."
"The scientific reality of climate change is more accepted than ever beforeto avert the worst effects of the rapidly changing climate, the world needs to transition to a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050."
But we still lack key strategies to avoid catastrophic climate change.
"The world needs agreement on the meaning of global net zero emissions, measurement to track our progress toward net zero, and mature markets for carbon reduction and removal that are necessary to get us there."
"Through our operations, technology, and advocacy, Microsoft is addressing these three areas to help drive the change that society needs."
"Our strategy to reach carbon negative by 2030 is relatively simplewe will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by improving efficiency, adopting new solutions, and purchasing zero carbon energy."
1 We are engaging suppliers and our business groups to cut our Scope 3 emissions by more than 50 percent and well rely on carbon removal to reach carbon negative.
"This year, we took strides forward on zero carbon energy, continued progress on carbon removal, and improved our methodologies and measurement of emissions data across the company."
We will continue to further refine how we measure and approach these categories as we move forward.
"We also took new steps to accelerate the work of others via the launch of a new solution, the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability , to help our customers measure their carbon emissions more effectively, and created resources to help decarbonize our supply chain."
Our commitment: carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050 to remove from the atmosphere an equivalent amount of all the carbon dioxide our company has emitted either directly or by our electricity consumption since we were founded in 1975.
Reducing direct emissions We will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by the middle of the decade through energy efficiency work and reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2025.
"Replacing with 100/100/0 carbon free energy By 2030, 100 percent of our electricity consumption will be matched by zero carbon energy purchases 100 percent of the time."
"Reducing value chain emissions By 2030, we will reduce our Scope 3 emissions by more than half from a 2020 baseline."
"Removing the rest of our emissions By 2030, Microsoft will remove more carbon than it emits."
"By 2050, well remove an equivalent amount of carbon to all our historical emissions."
"Empowering customers and partners We will help our suppliers, customers, and partners around the world to reduce their carbon footprints through our learnings and with the power of data, AI, and digital technology."
Using our voice on carbon-related public policy issues We will support new public policy initiatives to accelerate carbon reduction and removal opportunities.
"Investing in the future We have created a $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund to accelerate the global development of carbon reduction and removal technologies, as well as related climate solutions to reduce water and waste."
"16 Our progress Reduced Scope 1 and 2 by 16.9% We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market- based) emissions by 58,654 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO 2) in FY21."
Scope 3 emissions increased by 22.7 percent.
"5.8 GW of renewable energy In FY21, we signed new power purchase agreements (PPAs) for approximately 5.8 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy across 10 countries around the globe, totaling more than 8 GW of renewable energy via PPAs or long-term contracts."
"Supplier reporting to ols We released a set of in-depth capacity-building tools and resources, developed in partnership with ENGIE Impact, WSP, and CDP to help companies, especially our suppliers, report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and set strategies to reduce emissions from electricity."
"87% supplier reporting In July 2021, 87 percent of our in-scope suppliers reported their emissions to CDP, up 12 percent from 2020."
This data informs suppliers baselines for reduction targets and gives Microsoft a more accurate picture of its Scope 3 emissions.
"Following the CDP cycle, Microsoft built out action plans with suppliers to assess and report emission reductions through 2030."
"2.5M tons carbon removal In FY21 and FY22, Microsoft successfully contracted to remove 2.5 million mtCO 2, meeting our cumulative two-year goal."
"This includes 1.4 million mtCO 2 2 contracted in FY21 and 1.1 million mtCO 2 contracted to date in FY22, on path to meet our goal of 1.5 million mtCO 2 in FY22."
"$571M Allocated $471 million to date via our Climate Innovation Fund to accelerate our carbon goals, as well as water and waste."
We also donated $100 million to Breakthrough Energys Catalyst initiative.
"Launched the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability In July 2021, we launched the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability to provide comprehensive, integrated, and automated sustainability management for organizations at any stage of the sustainability journey."
"Our approach (continued) Improved device efficiency While overall device and console use phase emissions grew as a result of higher sales and usage during the pandemic, we reduced the carbon footprint for several products and usage scenarios: Surface Pro 8 is one of the most energy efficient Surf ace Pro devices ever."
"The new Surface Laptop Studio has a30 percent smaller carbon footprint thanits predecessor, the Surface Book 3 13.3 Energy-saving mode, a newlow-power standby mode for Xboxconsoles, uses as little as 0.5W."

"5.8 GW In FY21, we signed new PPAs for approximately 5.8 GW of renewable energy across 10 countries around the globe, totaling more than 8 GW of renewable energy via PPA s or long-term contracts."
Getting to carbon negative It is critical that companies take a rigorous approach to achieving net zero.
"This begins with recording and reporting emissions with better data collection and automation, reducing emissions as much as possible, replacing electricity consumption with renewables, and removing the remaining emissions."
"In January 2020, Microsoft announced its intention to be carbon negative, which will see us cut our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our operations to nearly zero and by over half by 2030 across our value chain with improv ements in energy efficiency, replacing with renewa ble energy for Scope 2, and removing the remainder of emissions."
We will also remove the equivalent amount of our historical carbon emissions by 2050.
Implement ing these commitments is a journey.
"At Microsoft, we have come to see this as a 5-R Journey that begins with recording and reporting emissions with better data collection and automation, then reducing as much as possi ble with that data-informed roadmap first, then replacin g fossil fuels in our electricity consumption with renewables, and finally removing what remains."
Our total com pany emissions (market-based) in 2021 were approximately 14 million mtCO 2.
"Of this total, about 120,000 mtCO 2 were Scope 1 emissions at Microsoft datacenters and campuses."
"Taking into account our renewable energy purchases, our Scope 2 emissions were approximately 160,000 mtCO 2."
"The bulk of our emissionsmore than 97 percentare in Scope 3, which includes emissions from our supply chain, the lifecycle of our hardware products and devices, travel, and other indirect sources."
"While our com bined Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased this year, we did see an increase in Scope 3 emissions, driven mainly by the growth of our cloud services business and an increase in sales and usage of our devices."
">50% We are committed to cutting our GHG emissions by over half by 2030 across our value chain, removing the residual emissions, and removing the equivalent amount of our historical carbon emissions by 2050."
It is critical that companies take a rigorous approach to achieving net zero.
We have come to see this as a 5-R Journey.
"20 Getting to carbon negative (continued) Reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions across our operations In each building at every campus and datacenter, sustainability is a key priority for Microsoft across all phases of a projectfrom site selection to design and construction to operations and decommissioning."
"By the middle of the decade, we are committed to reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero."
Reducing carbon emissions with efficiency solutions Ensuring our campuses and datacenters are energy efficient is a key first s tep in reducing our emissions.
"We are changing the w ay we build and operate facilities, using all-elect ric efficient system designs like the use of geothermal ene rgy and thermal energy recovery, and improving th e efficiency of our cloud."
"Scopes explained Scope 1 Direct emissions created by your activities Examples include the exhaust that comes from the vehicles on your campus, natural gas that your buildings directly consume, and the generators you might run."
Scope 2 Indirect emissions from the consumption of the electricity or heat you use Examples include energy sources that power your office buildings or your home.
Scope 3 Indirect emissions from all other activities in which youre engaged This is by far the largest category of emissions and covers all parts of your value chain (upstream and downstream).
"Upstream examples include supply chain, materials in buildings, business travel, and manufacturing."
Downstream examples include the electricity customers consume using your products.
Scope 3 measurement poses a significant opportunity for improvement.
Building for Zero C arbon and LEED certifications We are pursuing Z ero Carbon certification for our Silicon Val ley campus and Redmond campus modernization project with International Living Futures Institute.
"We have committed to certifying our Microsoft dat acenters and major offices to LEED Gold or Platinumwi th a focus on the categories of energy and atmospher e, water efficiency, materials and waste, location and t ransportation, sustainable sites, and indoor environmental conditions."
Four of our datacenters are LEED Gold cer tified and 74 projects are going through certification.
"Deploying AI to improve energy efficiency Microsoft is usi ng Bonsai, a low-code AI platform that is part of the Autonomous Systems suite from Microsoft, to improve the ef ficiency of its Redmond campus chiller plants."
These ch iller plants provide the air conditioning within an HVAC system and typically represent a substantial portion of the energy footprint of buildings.
We have seen a 12 per cent increase in median efficiency based on energy e stimates and plan to implement Bonsai in the 12 remain ing chiller plants this fiscal year.
"In the past, energy co nservation measures (ECM) projects took more than 12 months."
Bonsai enabled us to build a model and test recommendations in two to four weeks with comparable results.
Designing and op erating highly efficient datacenters All future datacenters will be LEED Gold certified with emphasis on water and energy conservation.
All lighting is high-efficiency LED with motion detection to minimize use of space light.
"Cooling systems are integrated with the servers, providing cooling only when the servers require it.21 Avoiding emissions with kinetic energy for backup power At the Bengaluru C osmo office site, we installed an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) with flywheel to store kinetic energ y to provide backup power without the need for lead acid batteries typically used in conventional UPS."
"The UPS flywh eel has the additional benefit of avoiding thous ands of metric tons of carbon emissions over its 20-year lifecycle and avoiding 1,500 lead acid batteries treated as hazardous waste at end-of-life."
Increasing ca rbon awareness and lowering carbon in cloud operations We are piloting n ew approaches that lower the carbon footprint of our code as well as large-scale workloads for Microsoft and o ur customers benefit.
"We piloted a new feature calle d Start/Stop VM s, which can automa tically turn off VMs during idle hours."
"Our engineers have also created more transparency inside Azure Machine Learning, displaying reso urce metrics (including GPU e nergy, utilization, and computational cost) to help data practitioners assess and mitigate the hidden costs of their machine learning workloads, and partnered with the Allen Institute for AI to develop a set of best practices and tools in this space."
"We developed the Carbon Aware Core, which helps schedule workloads in times and regions with the lowest carbon footprint, which is being piloted by Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Research and will be provided as an open-source toolkit through the Green Software Foundation."
Engineers are also testing and deploying novel approaches like Kubernetes Sche duler to take advanta ge of grid-level fluctuations in carbon intensity to mi nimize carbon.
"Transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy By 2025, we expect to power our datacenters and facilities with 100 percent additional, new renewable energy generation that matches our electricity consumption on an annual basis."
"Already, weve contracted for more than 8 GW of renewable energy."
"In addition to these purchases, were using our campuses as living laboratories for energy innovation."
See our full approach to renewable energy on the next page.
On-site zero carbon energy solutions We have installed on-site renewables at select campuses as well.
"At our Silicon Valley campus, a solar panel system will offset energy consumption up to 15 percent."
"Our Beijing and Shanghai Zizhu campuses have made similar efforts, installing photovoltaic (PV) solar panels on empty roof space in FY20 which are expected to generate 15,450 MWh of electricity over the next 25 years to power the campus."
LinkedIns new campus in Omaha features an on-site solar array over the parking structure.
"The system has an estimated annual output of approximately 750,000 kWh/year of electricity, equivalent to about 15 percent of all site energy usage, and is being integrated with on-site battery storage to help reduce peak demand and address any intermittent excess solar generation produced by the array."
"Harnessing thermal energy to halve energy consumption on campus In 2021, we unveiled our plans for a new, hyper-efficient thermal energy center for our Puget Sound campus, which utilizes geothermal wells to heat and cool our buildingsresulting in a 50 percent reduction in energy usage compared to the typical utility plant."
"In our Silicon Valley campus, thermal energy storage tanks will support the closed loop water system that provides all heating and cooling needs for the campus."
Removing fossil fuels from our campuses and datacenters We are leaving no stones unturned in our quest to reach net zero.
"We are eliminating our dependency on diesel fuel at our datacenters, electrifying our campus fleet, and moving to all electric kitchens."
Eliminating diesel fuel in datacenters Cloud providers around the world rely on diesel-powered generators for backup power to support continuous datacenter operations.
Microsoft has committed to be diesel-free by 2030.
Innovations include the following.
Renewable fuels: Our datacenter region in Sweden will be one of Microsofts first sites to use lower-carbon renewable fuel for backup power.
"The datacenters generators run on Preem Evolution Diesel Plus, the worlds first Nordic Eco-labelled fuel, which contains at least 50 percent renewable raw material, and nearly an equivalent reduction in net carbon dioxide emissions compared with standard fossil diesel blends."
This solution is being expanded to other datacenters across the world with other suppliers.
Getting to carbon negative (continued) Batteries as backup power: We are assessing the long-term feasibility of deploying large batteries as backup power for critical infrastructure via our strategic collaborat ion with TOTAL and are continuing research and development in this area.
We are also implementing an extended battery solution for datacenters that operate on highly reliable grids.
Our Swedish campuses are slated to pilot a battery energy storage system (BESS) solution to remove reliance on generators.
Hydrogen fuel cells: We are also piloting hydrogen fuel cells as viable green energy for backup power at our datacenters.
We announced a worldwide first in 2020hydrogen fuel cells powering a row of datacenter servers for 48 consecutive hours.
This successful pilot provided a proof of concept for supporting backup power needs that could be implemented once batteries reach their capacity.
Our primary power supply to an operating datacenter is now a hydrogen fuel cell.
"Electrifying our fleet We are committed to fully electrifying our global campus operations vehicle fleet of over 1,800 vehicles by 2030."
"Since announcing this target, we have spent the last year developing regionally specific implementation strategies, analyzing the vehicles, and determining the infrastructure needed to support operations."
"In the coming year, we will launch a series of pilots appropriate to each region to keep us on track to goal."
"Powering all electric kitchens with renewable energy In our Puget Sound campus modernization project, we have removed natural gas from campus, including cooking over 15,000 meals a day with only renewable electricity."
"LinkedIns updated design and build guidelines call for all-electric kitchens powered by renewable energy, designed to cook over 5,000 meals a day on clean power."
"1,800 We are committed to electrifying our global campus vehicle fleet of 1,800 vehicles by 2030."
Electrifying our global campus operations vehicle fleet.
"22 Feature story 100/100/0: a new approach to carbon-free energy Our com mitment is that by 2030, 100 percent of Microsofts energy supply, 100 percent of the time, will come from carbon-free resources."
This commitment completes the link between carbon-free resources and our facilities in both space and time.
Hourly renewable supply and demand matching strategies can help lay the groundwork for a decarbonized grid.
"23 Getting to carbon negative (continued) A path to carbon negative via energy The vast majority of Microsofts direct carbon emissions footprint comes from electricity, and as such, our work on carbon reduction has centered on using less of it, while at the same time ensuring we support the adoption of more carbon-free energy in the grids where we operate."
"While our goal has remained consistentto get to an energy supply that is entirely carbon-freeour approach has evolved as the supply of renewable energy has increased, markets have matured, and data has become more granular."
"A journey towards 100 percent Our initial commitment, set in 2012, was to cover 100 percent of our energy consumption with renewable energy certificates (RECs)."
We achieved our goal that same year by purchasing enough RECs to cover our annual energy consumption.
"However, a REC purchase is not always a direct contract with new renewable generation and does not always mean that the renewable generation is on the same grid as where we are consuming electrons."
"Put simply, pursuing unbundled RECs de-linked energy production and consumption in both geography and time, reducing the overall impact."
"Recognizing the importance of linking our renewable purchases to new impactful and additional renewable energy projects, Microsoft began engaging in renewable energy procurement through power purchase agreements (PPAs)."
"PPAs are a direct contractual relationship between a purchaser and a supplier for new renewable energy via a project or several projects; that is, the execution of the PPA provides the necessary revenue stream for new renewable energy projects to be built."
The direct contract establishes greater investor confidence in renewable projects and paves the way for more renewable generation on the grid.
We formalized our commitment to procuring energy from new impactful renewable energy projects in 2016 and updated it in 2020.
"In 2016, Microsoft announced a commitment to increasing proportion of PPA purchases, on a path towards 100 percent renewable energy."
"We pledged to procure enough renewable energy to offset 50 percent of our energy consumption by 2018 and 60 percent in the next decade, and further specified that wed aim to secure new renewable energy in the geography where our offices and datacenters are, bringing a stronger geographic connection between our contracted renewables and our electricity consumption."
"In 2020, as part of our carbon negative announcements, we committed to bring our commitment up to 100 percent by 2025."
"Like our earlier commitments, this was on an annual basis, requiring us to sign renewable energy offtake agreements to cover our energy needs; simply put, we will match every electron we consume on an annual basis with renewable energy."
"Moving beyond 100 percent to 100/100/0 While we are proud of this progress, the global shift to net zero carbon energy is not happening quickly enough."
The International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that the path to net zero emissions is very narrow and will require the deployment of all available clean energy technologies between now and 2030.
"For solar power, it is equivalent to installing the worlds largest solar park roughly every day."
"4 This reality is due to the fact that most electrons flowing onto grids today come from carbon-intensive sources, requiring large-scale replacement to meet our energy needs."
"Currently, energy storage is not deployed at scale, and the grid infrastructure of today is old and inadequate to meet the balancing needs of new renewable energy resources and the integration of net zero carbon resources, nor to the increasing consumption demands of a rapidly electrifying society."
Getting to carbon negative (continued) That is why we set a new 100/100/0 goal in 2021.
"Our commitment is that by 2030, 100 percent of Microsofts energy supply, 100 percent of the time, will come from zero carbon resources on grids where we operate."
The 100/100/0 commitment completes the link between zero carbon resources and our facilities in both space and time.
"Our 100/100/0 commitment provides a vision and roadmap to pair our operational goals with our research, technologies, and investments to drive global change."
"We are bringing new research to bear, including a white paper authored by RMI that highlights the potential for hourly energy monitoring tools to provide transparency into supply and demand for zero carbon energy."
The paper illustrates that hourly renewable supply and demand matching strategies can help lay the groundwork for a decarbonized grid.
The impact of our 100/100/0 commitment will be significant.
Matching zero carbon resources in both space and time will reduce Microsofts emissions to zero at all times and also bring benefits to the broader grid since the zero carbon resources we contract for will also be available to serve the grid when our consumption is lower or zero carbon energy output is higher.
"Moreover, we will be driving early deployment of advanced resources like hydrogen and long-duration storage to fill in the gaps when renewable energy sources are not generating."
"And finally, the energy transition will affect all and needs to benefit all, which is why we have built climate equity into our purchasing commitments."
Our impact to date Our renewable and zero carbon commitments to date are having real-world impact.
Microsoft is one of the largest purchasers of renewable energy in the world.
"Across 2020 and the first part of 2021, Microsoft signed new purchase agreements for approximately 6 GW of renewable energy across 10 countries around the globe."
"This includes over 35 individual deals, with 15 of those deals in Europe spanning Denmark, Sweden, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Ireland."
This latest procurement brings our operating and contracted renewable energy projects to 7.8 GW globally and we are positioned to continue to grow our renewable resource portfolio.
"In addition to these PPAs, Microsoft partnered with Volt Energy , the only national African American owned solar de velopment company, for a 250-MW portfolio of solar projects with the intent to create new opportunities for under-resourced communities and to help support a more diverse renewable energy industry."
"This builds on our progress on our community purchasing and skilling work with Sol Systems, which began a year ago."
We re also taking our learnings from our operational work and building new products to help accelerate global decarbonization.
"For example, our research led to the co-creation and adoption of the first commercial round-the-clock hourly energy-matching solution with o ur utility partner Vattenfall."
"Building on this work, were announcing a new around-the-clock pilot in the Netherlands with energy provider Eneco and FlexiDAO, a technology supplier, which will match one of our Amsterdam datacenters hourly energy consumption with the Dutch offshore windfarm Borssele."
"We k now that our actions alone will not decarbonize the grids, but we are committed to taking ambitious action to drive market demand signals that will influence the speed and scale at which the transformation happens."
"As Microsoft builds the tools and markets to meet our zero carbon commitments, we are mindful of the need for products, purchases, and policy that will enable a carbon-free energy system for all."
"Every net zero scenario shares a common, and essential, element: a massive increase in electrification."
"Electricity holds the promise of wiping out vast sections of the global emissions portfolio, but this only happens if the electrons supplying the electricity are generated from zero carbon energy sources."
Dr. Lucas Joppa Chief Environmental Officer Our Sweden datacenter will be fully supplied with hourly energy consumption with an offshore windfarm.
24 25 Getting to carbon negative (continued) Reducing Scope 3 emissions We are committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions by more than half by 2030.
"While we do not have direct control over most emissions in the Scope 3 category because they are generated by third parties, they represent more than 97 percent of our total emissions."
"Our carbon negative commitment includes reducing these emissions and removing what we cannot reduce, which we do through a reduction strategy in campuses and datacenters, rethinking the design of our devices, and engaging with our supply chain."
"This year, we saw an increase in Scope 3 emissions, driven mainly by the growth of our cloud services business and an increase in the sales and usage of our devices."
Campuses and datacenters Changing the way we work begins with measuring our impact on the planet.
"This includes looking at embodied carbon in each material that goes into our buildings, as well as the future of how we work, travel, and think about events."
Designing embodied carbon out of our buildings Were committed to reducing not just operational carbon but also embodied carbonthe carbon emitted during the manufacture and transport of building materialswhich accounts for at least 11 percent of global emissions and has historically been harder to track and reduce.
We have taken a number of steps to address and lower our carbon footprint.
We are committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions by more than half by 2030.
"We will achieve this through reduction strategies in campuses and datacenters, rethinking design of our devices, and engaging with our supply chain."
Our Silicon Valley campus includes the largest mass timber building in the United States.
"Data-driv e n decision-making and emissions tracking Microsoft partnered with other industry leaders to create a new open-source, Azure-hosted tool, the Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3), to track the embodied carbon of the raw building materials."
"We used the EC3 tool in designing 17 new buildings (3 million square feet) in our Puget Sound campus modernization project, where we are on track to reduce embodied carbon emissions by at least 30 percent."
We are now using the EC3 tool around the world in both our campuses and our datacenters to track and reduce embodied carbon and have found opportunities to reduce concrete and steel embodied carbon by 30 to 60 percent in our datacenters.
"5 Understa nding construction emissions to reduce them Microsoft an d our general contractors are creating a baseline for construction process emissions, which include transportation of materials to the construction site and construction installation."
"To date, there has been little data and no established, industry-consistent methodology for creating a baseline, making it difficult for design teams to know if their emissions are better or worse than a typical construction project."
"We piloted the tracking of construction activity emissions in our Puget Sound campus modernization project, starting with the demolition phase (including site excavation), as well as how much water we used."
"Getting to carbon negative (continued) 26 Leading the way on low-carbon building materials We are in n ovating and investing in low-carbon building materials across our global campuses and datacenters with the aim to achieve net zero embodied carbon, including the following."
"Mass timber: At our Silicon Valley campus, we are using mass timber, resulting in the largest mass timber building in the United States."
"In addition to using this lower carbon building material, we elected to keep two of the existing buildings on the site, providing 36 percent of the new campus footprint and accounting for a 28.6 percent reduction in total embodied carbon."
"5 With two floors of mass timber, the embodied carbon savings increases to approximately 36 percent with an estimated total of 372 kg CO 2e per square meter.5 With over 345,000 square feet, or 2,400 tons, of 100 percent Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified mass timber, the wood reflects biophilic principles and a reduced carbon mission."
We continue to incorporate mass timber on our campuses and are now testing the suitability of mass timber in datacenter environments and investigating sites to pilot these new materials.
Cement: Cement accounts for approximately 8 percent of global emissions.
We are testing and piloting low-GHG cement innovations like CarbonCure to reduce the carbon footprint of our buildings.
LinkedIn is using low-carbon and carbon-sequestering concrete mixes for our new Silicon Valley headquarters and is now using these materials in our LinkedIn Dublin campus.
"In our datacenters, we are reducing how much cement we use by utilizing longer 56-day cure times in lieu of typical 28-day cure times."
We are also specifying the use of cement replacement pr oducts such as fly ash and slag that reduce the carbon footprint of concrete.
"Low-carbon materials: We also complete d research on low-carbon materials in collaboration with Carbon Leadership Forum (CLF), a nonprofit industry academic organization at the University of Washington."
"The research explores six low-carbon materialsearthen slabs, non-Portland cement concrete slabs, algae-grown bricks/panels, mycelium (mushroom) structural tubes, purpose-grown fiber, and agricultural waste panels that can help reduce carbon emissions and change the climate profile of building constructions."
We are piloting the use of these materials for our datacenters.
We are innovating and investing in low-carbon building materials across our global campuses and datacenters with the aim to achieve net zero embodied carbon.
"This year, we became a founding member in SABA."
"This year, we became a founding member in SABA."
"Rethinking how we travel Although emissions related to business travel represented less than 5 percent of our total emissions, we know that we can have a larger impact with our investments and partnerships."
We have made two investments in SAF with airline partners KLM and Alaska.
"This year, we expanded this work by becoming a founding member in the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) and participating in the World Economic Forums Clean Skies for Tomorrow ."
We are actively supporting the development of an SAF certificate which will set GHG accounting standards for the use of SAF to reduce emissions by both customers and airlines in the future.
"We are also looking to reduce emissions in other areas where our learnings in SAF can be applied, from freight and logistics to the fuel used in our datacenter backup generators."
"Devices Over the past year, devices became even more essential as they kept us connected, working, and learning through the pandemic."
"This year, higher-than-anticipated demand translated to higher sales and greater usage, which caused our absolute emissions to grow."
We are committed to reducing the carbon intensity of our devices and our efforts have also grown this year.
"We have made significant investments to expand our data-driven lifecycle assessment (LCA) and telemetry approach to better measure, inform, and prioritize top reduction opportunities to reduce our device carbon intensity across the full lifecycle of our devices."
"These efforts include carbon-conscious design, reducing supply chain emissions, innovating energy-efficient hardware and software in use, and enabling product repairability, reusability, and recyclability."
"This will allow us to deliver the best product experience with lower carbon intensity, while also partnering with our users to minimize carbon footprint when using our products."
"Building a data-driven platform for product design In 2020, we began working on a platform to allow engineers to make real-time design and material selection decisions based on carbon impact, a key enabler in modeling and reducing our future device emissions."
"To generate our device carbon footprints, we conduct LCAs in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 which enable us to estimate emissions from manufacturing our devices down to the individual component level."
"Further, we are upgrading our audit management sourcing tool to ensure supplier carbon reduction initiatives are fully reflected in these product carbon footprints."
We pair this with improved product usage and distribution data.
"For example, the most recent iterations of the Xbox Series X|S have improved our awareness of full ecosystem energy usage from consoles, information which is critical to future energy efficiency improvements and emissions reductions."
These investments allow us more control over our product emissions across their full lifecycle.
"Sustainable Product Lifecycle Experimenting with lower carbon design As informed by our LCAs, a significant lever in product development is the engineering of low-carbon design alternatives, such as using recycled materials and designing for a smaller manufacturing footprint."
"Reduced waste We designed our Surface Laptop Studio to allow for stamping, a lower-waste manufacturing technique that reduced our aluminum scrap rate for the products base by at least 25 percent, a key contributor to an overall product carbon reduction of 30 percent versus its predecessor, the Surface Book 3 13 ."
"6 Metals We are developing opportunities to reuse manufacturing scrap in aluminum production, allowing us to use lower-carbon, 100 percent post-industrial recycled closed loop aluminum for future Surface computer housings."
"For neodymium in magnets, a rare earth material, we are also exploring post-industrial scrap as a manufacturing feedstock, enabling us to produce 100 percent recycled neodymium in magnets for future products."
"Circuit boards In our labs, we are working to engineer a lower-carbon and reduced-waste flax-based wiring board and experimenting with 3D printing; we have started to explore 100 percent post-industrial recycled tin in our soldering paste; and we are aiming to reduce overall materials needed through new spacing guidelines that can shrink our circuit boards in size by up to 25 percent."
"30% Reduction in total carbon emissions of 30 percent for Surface Laptop Studio versus its predecessor, Surface Book 3 13 ."
"-Getting to carbon negative (continued) 27 Product design Raw materials sourcing Packaging and distribution Product use Product manufacturing End-of life Repair, refurbishment, and recycling - Surface Pro 8 running Windows 11."
17% Total energy consumption for the Surface Pro 8 is 17 percent smaller than Pro 7.
>80% Energy-saving mode can reduce Xbox power usage in standby mode by over 80 percent.
"Reducing the footprint of distribution Microsoft is an active member in the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC), an industry collaboration through Smart Freight Centre, committing to reducing logistics emissions through sustainable freight initiatives."
Microsoft uses this framework to calculate and measure the carbon impact of its Scope 3 transportation emissions.
"7 For shipping, we have an intelligent platform to measure our emissions impact down to individual shipments, and a carbon emissions budget has been developed utilizing the same methodology."
"In our distribution network, this year we finished a complete conversion of our primary distribution center in Europe to 100 percent renewable energy."
This facility now generates 1.3 million kWh from solar energy and avoids 690 mtCO 2 annually.
Through FY22 we will plan to convert our US distribution centers to 100 percent renewable energy through solar panel installations and using green renewable sources.
"We are also building more sustainable shipping options, such as the delivery option launched in December 2021 to avoid higher-carbon air freight, to give customers a choice of more sustainable options when ordering from Microsoft."
"Boosting efficiency of devices in use For Microsoft devices, energy efficiency is a balance of hardware and software innovation."
"This year, overall device and console use phase emissions grew as a result of higher sales and usage from customers reliant on these products during the pandemic."
"That being said, several of our newest products launched in 2021 were designed to be the most energy efficient devices in their product lines, including the Surface Pro 8 and Surface Laptop 4 running Windows 11."
"The most recent iterations of the Xbox Series X|S have improved our awareness of full ecosystem energy usage from consoles, information which is critical to future energy efficiency improvements and emissions reductions."
Software design can also increase efficiency.
"We are focused on offering low-emissions usage options such as Energy-saving mode on Xbox, which can reduce power usage during standby mode from 15 W down to 0.52 W, as well as Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will be powered by Azure datacenters running on 100% renewable energy by 2025."
"With the release of energy-saving mode, we are updating the initial bootup experience for users to provide clear messaging to enable user understanding of power modes, while encouraging them to implement energy-saving mode on their consoles."
This will be paired with a reduction in idle and shutdown timers to continue to improve power consumption during console idle periods.
"Providing transparency for customers To increase transparency for customers and stakeholders, we publish LCA results for our Xbox consoles and Surface devices."
"The LCA results are contained in our Ecoprofiles , along with information about the products material composition, energy consumption, packaging, ecolabels, product recycling, and other environmental attributes."
"We have also developed a new, dynamic way for commercial customers to gain insight into the carbon footprint of their entire Surface device fleets."
The Microsoft Surface Emissions Estimator enables sellers to work with customers and estimate the carbon impact of the Surface devices and key accessories they purchase from us.
"Getting to carbon negative (continued) 28 Getting to carbon negative (continued) Supply chain In July 2020, Microsoft added additional sustainability requirement s to its Supplier Code of Conduct to support the com panys bold carbon ambitions."
This new language requires suppliers to disclose their own carbon footprints and develop plans to reduce them.
Microsoft has spent the past year rolling out these requirements to a subset of its suppliers and building a program to support them.
"Engaging with suppliers on reduction roadmaps In July 2021, 87 percent of Microsofts in-scope suppliers reported thei r emissions to CDP, up 12 percent from 2020."
"Following the closure of the CDP cycle, we worked with suppliers to build action plans of emission reduction activities leading up to 2030."
This included educational webinars and one-on-one meetings with suppliers to dive into their individual footprints and discuss relevant reduction levers.
Microsoft also provided suppliers with resources to aid in their reduction efforts.
"We continue to believe that for Microsoft to reach our reduction goals, collaboration with suppliers is fundamental and we look forward to continuing the journey together."
"In 2021, we released a set of in-depth capacity-building tools and resources to help our suppliers report their GHG emissions, develop clean energy strategies, and reduce their energy-related emissions."
"Providing new tools and training for supplier reporting When Microsoft rolled out emission reporting and reduction requirements in our Supplier Code of Conduct, the top feedback from suppliers was the need for simple yet comprehensive resources to walk them through the carbon accounting process."
"In response, we released a set of in-depth capacity-building tools and reso urces , developed in pa rtnership with ENGIE Impact, WSP, and CDP to help companies, and particularly our suppliers, report their GHG emissions, develop clean energy strategies, and reduce their energy-related emissions."
"In September 2021, LinkedIn released a new course, Fundamental s of Sustainable Supply Chain Management , to help organi zations and professionals more effectively engage with their suppliers."
"Building new forms of financing for suppliers Based on our engagements with suppliers, we knew more technica l resources were necessary but insufficient to drive change ."
Our suppliers need access to new forms of finance t o invest in new solutions.
"This year, we launched a new partnershi p with the Inter national Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group."
"IFC will work with designated Microsoft suppliers in emerging markets, starting in Asia, to identify technical solutions reducing GHG emissions, provide implementat ion assistance, and offer financing solutions to help them make investments in more efficient and low-carbon oper ations."
"Reimagining circularity in our supply chain We have taken a first-of-a-kind approach towards designing and implementing Circular Centers in our datacenter campuses, aligning our end-of-life dispositioning processes with an integrated plan across the entire supply chain."
"From sustainable design at the start of an asset lifecycle to sustainable sourcing, manufacturing, delivery, and use, towards a diversified approach after decommissioning, this integrated plan ensures that assets are dispositioned to optimize value, security, compliance, and sustainability."
"Over the past year, we have engaged with new suppliers who are able to remanufacture assets and components, effectively enabling new lifecycles for our assets."
"We have successfully demonstrated takeback/buyback models with our original asset suppliers, closing the loop on assets and enabling suppliers to repurpose or reuse assets and components, resulting in significant sustainability outcomes for emissions reduction and material recovery."
"Our Circular Center program will enable 90 percent reuse of datacenter computing assets, significantly contributing to our goal of reducing emissions by more than 50 percent by 2030."
"In FY21, our overall reuse of assets was 78 percent."
"Using lifecycle assessments for targeted hardware improvements As we outline in Chapter 4 of our Responsible Sourcing 2021 Report, we are executing an ambitious plan to empower all strategic device suppliers to commit to science-based carbon reduction activities specifically targeted to reduce emissions associated with hardware manufacturing."
"We have used LCAs to prioritize supplier categories that contribute the greatest emissions as well as the types of actions suppliers can take to make the biggest shifts in decarbonization, including powering their operations with renewable energy, increasing process and energy efficiencies, and reducing material use and waste onsite."
"To learn more, see Chapter 4 of the Responsible Sourcing 2021 Report 29 Removing carbon In January 2021, Microsoft announced that we had made the worlds largest purchase of carbon removal in history."
"Our focus on removals instead of avoided emissions offsets is aligned to our carbon negative commitment but is also motivated by what climate science tells us is needed to reach net zerospecifically the IPCCs projection that the planet could need as much as 10 gigatons of carbon dioxide removal by mid-century, depending on the scale and pace of decarbonization."
"With our purchases as well as our investments, we are working to help build this new market with integrity and quality."
It hasnt been easy.
"As we documented in our September 2021 Nature article, high-quality carbon removal is scarce for three reasons."
"First, there is not a clear common definition of net zero and the role that removals play in net zero goals."
"Second, removals are not well accounted for in the practice of carbon measurement, which itself is still evolving."
"And third, the removal market is very young, especially for truly permanent carbon removal, which is prohibitively expensive."
"We know that were among the early entities to do homework on this topic, and thats why we are committed to sharing lessons learned, as documented in our 2021 white paper and high-quality removal criteria ."
We are actively working with our Climate Innovation Fund to invest in promising carbon removal companies.
"We have contributed comments to policy frameworks that set the standards for carbon removal, such as a carbon removal certification program by the European Commission, and efforts by the United States federal government (both the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy) to specify high-quality removal."
And we continue to evolve our own removal portfolio mix to be a balance of low-durability and high-durability volumes.
"Carbon removal projects In our first year, we chose projects that will help meet our commitment while supporting innovation in the market, including the following."
Community-based reforestation Taking Roots CommuniTree reforestation in Nicaraguathe largest such project in the countrypartners with farming families to help develop sustainable livelihoods by growing native tree species on marginal farmland.
The United Nations and the European Union have used this project as a model for reforestation.
"Biochar We invested in a portfolio from Puro.earth Oy, including from Carbon Cycle, Carbofex, and ECHO2, small operations in Germany, Finland, and Australia that use biomass residue (for example, wood chips and forest waste) to sequester carbon dioxide in biochar for use in soil amendment and other products."
Direct air capture We are actively working with our Climate Innovation Fund to invest in promising carbon removal companies and projects.
Climeworks Orca direct air capture plant in Iceland removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it permanently underground using a mineralization technology developed by the Icelandic company Carbfix.
"Our FY22 aspir ation was even larger, aiming for 1.5 million mtCO 2."
"We launched a new request for proposals in July 2021, seeking the highest quality of projects on the market, both nature-based and engineered."
"We are on a path to fulfilling that goal, with 1.1 million mtCO 2 contracted to date in FY22."
Getting to carbon negative (continued) 1.1M mtCO2 removal contracted to date in FY22.
"Looking ahead, we know that the market needs to improve the quality of carbon removal accounting, and that we need to have a clearer line of sight to affordable supply."
Thats why in 2021 we undertook the following projects.
"In partnership with Carbon Direct, we published our carbon dioxide removal guidance ."
These criteria are our minimal viable specifications for the most common project types that we will consider for procurement.
We will continue to expand on our criteria as the market adapts and see this as part of our market development work.
We funded research by Carbon Plan to produce their lessons learned and analysis from a systematic review of 14 protocols for soil carbon offsets for buyers from projects in the voluntary market today.
"We commissioned a re port from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on likely carbon removal supply and cost projections for 2030, which will be available in Q1 of 2022."
"We collaborated with researchers from the University of Vermont, University of Minnesota, Concordia University, and Simon Fraser University to develop and explore the climate implications of temporary carbon storage in nature as a means to inform our carbon removal strategies."
We co-founded the Business Alliance for Scaling Climate Solutions and the carbon removal workgroup of the World Economic Forums Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders.

"The foundation has grown to 20 members and over 350 individual contributors collaborating on standards, innovation, and education."
"The first version of the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) standard, a methodology for scoring software applications, was released in December 2021."
"39 Enabling systems change (continued) Advocating for net zero Future climate-related risks would be reduced by the upscaling and acceleration of far-reaching, multi-level, and cross-sectoral climate mitigation and by both incremental and transformational adaptation."
Those efforts must be guided by policy that accelerates carbon reduction and removal opportunities.
"Over the past year Microsoft deepened its policy advocacy on carbon and sharpened its focus on net zero goals, energy grid decarbonization, measurement, and markets in the United States and European Union through direct lobbying, engagement, and groups such as the Climate Leadership Council, CERES BICEP Network, Advanced Energy Economy, Climate and Clean Energy Solutions, and the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance."
Microsoft initiatives include the following.
Net zero policies Microsoft is encouraging countries to make net zero carbon-aligned national commitments and develop effective implementation plans.
Microsoft advocated for the United States reentry to the Paris Climate Agreement which occurred in January 2021 and for a national US climate target to cut emissions by 50 percent by 2030.
"We also voiced Microsoft support of the European Commissions Fit for 55 package , a set of legislative initiatives that will set the framework for the whole EU to achieve the binding target of reducing GHG emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 (based on 1990 levels)."
"Grid decarbonization Microsoft advocated for strong climate and clean energy provisions in the 2021 US budget reconciliation and infrastructure bills including new siting authority for transmission lines, support for innovative technologies and projects that remove carbon dioxide, modernizing the grid, accelerating clean energy, and strengthening resilience to the impacts of a changing climate."
"Microsoft actively engages in decarbonization and grid modernization policy efforts in Arizona, Texas, Illinois, and Virginia, and encouraged FERC to issue policy guidance on how to incorporate state-determined carbon prices in wholesale electricity markets."
"In Europe, Microsoft engages actively with the European institutions advocating for robust clean energy rules and sustainability metrics for datacenters and submitted comments in February to the European Commission Public Consultations on the revisions of the Renewable Energy Directive and Energy Efficiency Directive."
Microsoft engaged with the UK government and energy regulator to inform the Digitalising the UK energy system for net zero strategy published in July and its implementation.
Carbon measurement Microsoft is advocating for common accounting and public disclosure of carbon and climate-related information.
"In June, Microsoft submitted comments to the US Securities Exchange Commission in support of the development and adoption of disclosure rules that will provide material, decision-useful information for investors."
"In September, Microsoft filed an aligned response to the UK Financial Conduct Authoritys consultation on Carbon Measurement and provided information to the US Department of Defense on climate change disclosure practices to support implementation of the Executive Order on Climate Related Financial Disclosure."
"In March, Microsoft joined t he European Green Digital Coalition , supported by the Eu ropean Commission, with the goals of developing standardized, credible, and comparable methodologies for calculating the net impact of green digital solutions in different sectors, and accelerating the contribution of digital technology to our collective 2030 goals."
"Microsoft supported a new academic report by Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL), exploring how trade and trade-related policies could be used to support de carbonization, focused on the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAM), as part of advancing the conversation around common standards for carbon measurement and accounting."
"Carbon-related markets Microsoft is advocating a range of policies to help carbon-related markets mature, including carbon pricing and research and development (R&D)."
"Microsoft supported the Washington State Climate Commitment Act, approved in May, which sets a cap on emissions and establishes a robust carbon pricing and investment program."
"Microsoft advocated for increased US R&D in key technologies such as energy storage and direct air capture, which was included in the 2020 Energy Act and the bipartisan infrastructure package."
"Microsoft is advancing the development of carbon removal markets and consistent, high-quality carbon removal standards through comments to the US Department of Agriculture and by joining the Carbon Capture Coalition."
"In August, Microsoft submitted a response to the European Commission Carbon Removal Certification Mechanism survey to advocate for common standards for carbon removal quality and to provide input into the design of a future legislative framework."
Microsoft is advocating for common accounting and public disclosure of carbon and climate-related information.
40 Key trends FY21 was a year of progress and learning for Microsoft on our journey to carbon negative.
1 Carbon removal demand is hotand durable supply is short.
Carbon removal is a sellers market.
"The pipeline is short for surging demand, and corporate buyers need more project development."
"Climate change is further complicating this, as wildfires erode the forest carbon purchases weve made and we, as well as other purchasers, need expanded credit buffers to ensure credits we pay for are removing carbon from the atmosphere."
2 Progress on carbon reduction will be lumpy as carbon data and measurement improves.
"As Microsoft and the world mature in carbon accounting, we will continue to get better at understanding how our decisions reduce, or sometimes increase, carbon emissions."
"For example, some of the data used to estimate hardware emissions within certain categories of Scope 3 is drawn from industry-average secondary data rather than directly from suppliers."
"This data may not be reflective of recent supplier activity, which may cause fluctuations in emissions as primary data from suppliers is introduced."
3 Carbon removal still lacks common standards needed to scale.
"Projects d ont consistently account for durability, additionality, and leakage."
"To scale the market in the long term, we need the enabling infrastructure to measure, monitor, and verify carbon removal quality now, and we need clear guidelines under the Paris Agreement about how to reconcile corporate and country-level actions."
See Microsoft Carbo n Removal - Lessons From an Early Corporate Purchase to learn more.
4 Climate change is a global issue whose impacts are felt locally.
Displacing incumbent technologies and spurring innovation needs to be supported in all geographies to address the uneven distribution of those impactsboth positive and negativearound the world.
5 Small percentages of our emissions require big efforts to address.
"For example, diesel fuel accounts for less than 1 percent of Microsofts overall emissions."
"But finding solutions to reduce reliance on traditional diesel fuels, which power the backup infrastructure that supports our datacenters, will require significant innovation and investment by those with a much greater stake and reward than Microsoft alone."
This same scenario plays out for electrifying our fleet and transitioning to induction cooktops.
41 Whats next?
"1 Develop the markets Longer-term purchasing contracts send a firm demand signal for developers, creating a business case for them to help build plants."
2 Drive quality Microsoft is dedicated to continuing being a pioneer in addressing the climate crisis head on.
We will continue to help ensure project quality in the market and drive for more accurate carbon accounting.
"3 Innovate in renewable energy and carbon reduction We expect to focus on further innovations in renewable energy, carbon reduction, and carbon-free materials."
"For example, by using machine learning to forecast electricity load, we can enable grid-interactive datacenter components, such as batteries for backup power, to participate in ancillary energy markets and stabilize an electric grid with a higher penetration of renewable energy sources."
Well conduct new research to inform the technical and business possibilities of co-locating datacenters with offshore wind farms and investigating the feasibility of using supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2) as a coolant for immersion of servers within the datacenter.
"4 Pilot diesel-free backup power We are innovating and piloting other backup power sources in our datacenter regions, which could in the future provide viable replacements for generators."
"Batteries already supply short-term backup power needs, filling the roughly 30-second gap between a potential outage on the grid and the time it takes to power up the diesel generators."
"In the future, batteries with a longer duration could replace the role diesel generators play today."
5 Reduce embodied carbon We are continually evaluating design changes and developing new specifications to facilitate deep embodied carbon reductions in our campus and datacenter designs.
"We are analyzing both the optimal use of conventional materials, such as concrete and steel, and pursuing more ambitious opportunities with emerging alternative materials that carry significantly less embodied carbon."
"We are also developing solutions to help organizations reduce and manage emissions and energy consumption, such as through Azure IoT solutions for energy and sustainability."
"6 Continue to invest in carbon removal We continue to pursue new opportunities to fund high integrity, engineered carbon removal projects."
"We are also investing in digital tools to scale nature-based carbon removal solutions, such as soil carbon sequestration technologies."
7 Decarbonize our supply chain We will continue refining emission reduction plans with suppliers and ensuring that they have the resources they need to make these reductions with a goal of having the aggregate reductions meet Microsofts Scope 3 commitment.
"We will continue to embed sustainability into procurement processes and reset goals, metrics, and incentives to support carbon reduction targets."
"8 Enable product carbon compara b ility In Microsofts commentary to the Securities Exchange Commission climate disclosure, we predic ted, Individual consumers will have the ability to choose among competing products based on relative carbon emissions, as they do today when it comes to the nutritional content of food products."
"While many companies report their products carbon footprints using well-established methodologies, these footprints are not currently comparable due to divergent, non-standard, and proprietary data and assumptions."
Microsoft is exploring how to enable new methodologies and standards for comparable product labels that could be used across industries and administered by independent certification or regulatory bodies.

"47 Getting to water positive To meet our commitment to being water positive by 2030, we will reduce our water footprint across our direct operations, while replenishing and increasing water access in water-stressed regions where we work."
"Reducing our water footprint We are taking new approaches to water collection, treatment, reuse, and reduction at our campuses and datacenters across the globe."
This includes efficiency measures as well as fit-for-purpose water usage designwe are focused on using the right type of water in the right context from campus to datacenters to device manufacturing.
Key efforts include the following.
"Using less, reusing more, and recycling water across our datacenters Microsoft is using the Smart Water Navigator , which we developed with Ecolab, in our datacenters to prioritize and manage incoming water quality sources like recycled water."
"In San Antonio, Texas, we have significantly reduced the datacenters potable water usage, which will now be used to supply water to homes, providing economic as well as environmental benefits."
"We deployed sensors in our Quincy, Washington datacenter location, where were using the data on real-time water quality to drive operational insights and adjustments to maintenance and water chemistry."
"Across our operations, were testing new techniques, like raising supply air temperatures and harvesting water from our rooftops, to further reduce water consumption."
Using the right type of water in the right context in datacenters.
"Keeping datacenters cool using air Across our global datacenter fleet, outside air is our primary method of cooling for an average of nine months of the year."
"External temperatures and humidity play a key role in determining when additional cooling is requiredand when required, we utilize an adiabatic cooling system to reduce air temperature by evaporating water in its presence."
"Adiabatic cooling, along with higher temperature operations, significantly reduces power and water usage when comparing to mechanical water-based cooling systems."
"At our new datacenter region in Arizona, which opened in June 2020, we use zero water for cooling for more than half the year, taking advantage of adiabatic cooling."
"We are also partnering with First Solar to provide solar energy rather than traditional electricity generation, which will reduce power plant cooling water."
"Zero water At our new datacenter region in Arizona, we use zero water for cooling for more than half the year, taking advantage of adiabatic cooling."
"48 Getting to water positive (continued) Pioneering research and implementation of liquid immersion cooling to reduce water In 2021, Microsoft was the first cloud provider to run two-phased liquid immersion cooling in a production environment, demonstrating viability for broader use in our datacenters."
"We are using liquid immersion in a production environment, which involves placing servers in a tub of inert fluid that boils at 50C, which removes the heat generated by the chips, servers, and power supplies, and condenses the fluid in coils at the top of the rack."
This rains back in the tank.
"Because of the elevated operating temperature, this type of cooling does not require use of evaporated water."
"Our latest testing addresses the concept of overclocking, which is to operate chip components beyond their pre-defined voltage, thermal, and power design limits to further improve performance."
Our tests found that some chipsets show an increased performance by 20 percent with liquid cooling.
"This may also have benefits beyond reduction of water use, as this approach can allow for datacenter rack designs that create increased capacity per square foot in a datacenter."
Raising the temperature while maintaining quality Were investigating and piloting turning up the heat in our datacenters.
The higher server inlet temperatures will reduce cooling hours and water use.
"If the pilot is successful, we expect to be fully implemented by 2025, which has the potential to eliminate water use for cooling in regions like Amsterdam and Dublin, while reducing water use in dry regions like Arizona and Wyoming."
Fit-for-purpose water design in our Hyderabad campus.
"4M liters In Hyderabad, India, were piloting air-to-water generators to help offset 4 million liters of ground water extraction per year."
"Building net zero campus in California In 2021, our new Silicon Valley campus officially opened."

"These generator plants will help offset 4 million liters of ground water extraction per year, based on company calculations, in this water-stressed region, where water scarcity is an ongoing crisis that is expected to worsen."
"Reducing water in device textiles Microsoft uses textiles in our computer palm rests and type covers, and the textile industry is one of the biggest consumers of water."
"Each of the various manufacturing phases, including yarn processing, greige production, and the dyeing finish process requires a significant amount of water."
"To reduce water, we removed the dyeing process on our CLARINO fabric by switching to a solution dye technique which reduces water consumption by 20 percent."
"This is a completely solvent-free, environmentally friendly manufacturing choice that is used in three of our products currently in production across the HoloLens and Surface type cover lines."
"49 50 Getting to water positive (continued) Replenishing water As part of our commitment to be water positive by 2030, we will replenish more water than we consume, focusing on high water-stressed regions."
"We will achieve this goal by investing in water projects that protect watersheds, restore wetlands, and improve infrastructure."
"In addition to generating volumetr ic water benefits, many projects offer a wide range of additional co-benefits."
"When sourcing water rep lenishment projects, we consider contextual conditions of the watershed and aim to invest in project s that align with site-specific water assessments and h ave local stakeholder support."
We have invested in 21 proj ects to date in nine water basins across the globe.
"In FY21, Microsoft invested in projects that are expected to generate over 1.3 million cubic meters of volumetr ic benefits."
"Progress towards our commitment is made pos sible due to several strategic partnerships with non-governmental organizations, such as Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF), the Water Resilience Coalition (WRC), the Nature Conservancy, and implementation partners, including Trout Unlimited, Ducks Unlimited, National Audubon Society, and WaterAid."
"We also participate in the California Water Action Collaborative, a network of over 25 organizations learning together, collectively developing projects, and advancing innovative solutions to improve water security and resilience across California."

Reversing environmental degradation in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges.
"1.3M In FY21, Microsoft invested in replenishment projects that are expected to generate over 1.3 million cubic meters of volumetric benefits."
"Given the nascent water r eplenishment project market, we make investments at le ast a fiscal year before a project delivers volumetric benefits."
"We are still able to make estimates on volumetric benefits, just as we do with renewable energy proj ects upon signing even though the project has yet to be built."
We are taking new steps to validate these estimates.
"In FY21, 10 of Microsofts replenishment project investments underwent a third- party quantification to v erify and update the initial volumetric benefit estimates using the Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting (VWBA) guidance."
We will continue to use the VWBA guidance to q uantify volumetric water benefits when contract ing with a replenishment partner.
"Many projects are already delivering volumetric, ecosystem, and community benefits, such as the following."
Restoring the East Creek meadow Microsoft has invested in a project to restore the East Creek meadow and reverse environmental degradation caused by disconnection of the channels in Californias Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Mountain ranges from th e meadows and floodplains below.
"September 2021 gro undwater levels indicate that the meadow is beginning to retain groundwater during the dry season, even with reduced precipitation and late-season contributions from snowpack runoff."
"The restoration has als o contributed to fire resiliency within two months of the Dixie fire, native species were re-sprouting in the b urned areas due to residual soil moisture."
"Getting to water positive (continued) Groundwater recharge and water security in Phoenix Microsoft and Gila River Water Storage are recharging and replenishing groundwater levels in the cities of Goodyear and El Mirage, Arizona, to balance a portion of Microsofts future water use, contributing an estimated additional 610,000 cubic meters."

Key trends 2021 was a year of progress and learning for Microsoft on our journey to water positive.
1 Water requires a collective approach.
Companies will not be successful in managing water stress in regions where we operate if we try to tackle challenges independently.
"It will be vital to partner with a wide range of stakeholders, including NGOs, governments, customers, and competitorsparticularly in high-stress locations with a limited supply of replenishment projects."
2 Replenishment is more than a procurement exercise.
"Project oversight and monitoring of projects with multi-year benefits, and check-ins with implementation partners are all important."
"Its also necessary to validate the total volumetric benefit, additional co-benefits, and project duration through third-party quantification."
"Cultivating credible partners to identify the right project type for each unique location is critical, particularly for locations with limited supply of shelf-ready projects."
3 Better water data drives action.
Utility bills only provide some of the information companies need to truly understand and manage their risk and reduce their water use and the data typically does not arrive for months after the water was used.
"By installing sensors across our datacenters, we have been able to track our water use in real time, allowing us to more effectively monitor our reductions and identify opportunities for increased water efficiency."
"As we improve the quality of data across our operations, we have learned that the true cost of water is not aligned with its true value."
This misalignment makes it challenging for companies to make the business case for water-related investments.
It is something we are grappling with and will continue to explore across our operations.
58 Whats next?
1 Replenish more water than we consume by 2030 We will continue to make progress against our 2030 replenishment commitment.
We have prioritized our investments in high-stress locations where we operate and work with partners to identify the right type of replenishment projects that align with the unique challenges in each location.
"We will continue to prioritize opportunities to partner with other stakeholders, including companies that operate in the same locations."
"2 Enable access to drinking water and sanitation We will continue to work with Water.org to make prog ress against our accessibility commitment, providing 1.5 million people with access to clean water by 2030."
"Our support thus far has focused on Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico, and will expand to include China, Malaysia, and South Africa."
"We will continue to explore water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) solutions that will provide people across the globe with access to clean water and continue to identify opportunities to implement them."
3 Invest in partnerships We will continue to invest in new and existing partnerships that will enable Microsoft to make progress against our commitments and help protect water resources for future generations.
"Given the collective approach required to solve shared water challenges, we will continue to build on partnerships like the Water Resilience Coalition (WRC) that bring companies together to pool funding and invest in solutions in locations with extreme water stress."
We will also continue to support investments through our AI for Earth fund that strengthen water data and drive outcomes.
"4 Increase water efficiencies across our operations and identify innovative solutions To drive water use reductions in the short and long term, increasing efficiency is critical and it must be paired with innovation to ensure businesses can continue to operate in an unpredictable future with increasing water challenges."
"As we identify innovative approaches that work, we look forward to scaling these within Microsoft and sharing them outside of our four walls to further reduce pressure on the shared water resources we depend on."
"5 Evaluate water impacts beyond our operations We recognize that water is a challenge not just across our operational footprint, but also across our value chain."
We will continue to explore ways we can support suppliers in understanding and managing their water risks.
We also recognize that water and energy are interlinked.
Energy is required to pump and transport water and similarly water is required to produce electricity.
We will continue to strengthen our understanding of the ways our energy procurement decisions can affect water resources.
6 Identify technology adoption opportunities for water We will use the investment from our Climate Innovation Fund into Emerald Technology Ventures to identify technology adoption opportunities for emerging water technologies that can help Microsoft achieve our water positive commitment and support our customers.

Everyone must do their part.
"Dr. Lucas Joppa, Chief Environmental Officer Contents Our approach 62 Getting to zero waste 65 Driving transformation 69 Enabling systems change 71 Key trends 74 Whats next?"
"75 Resources 77 61 Our approach Our commitment to a zero waste future The context Every year, people consume 100 billion tons of materials, and in 2020 only 8.6 percent of those materials were cycled back into the economy after use, according to the 2021 Circularity Gap Report ."
"Linear systems and existing infrastructure are not adequate to maintain, collect, and redistribute materials effectively for a global circular economy."
"As a result, waste, including plastics, e-waste, and food waste, pollutes our land, clogs our waterways, depletes natural resources, and contaminates the air we breathe."
"We recog nize the urgent need to protect the worlds biodiversity and ecosystems, give equal access to a safe and healthy environment, reduce carbon emissions associated with the creation and end-of-life of these materials, and meet the needs of a growing population."
"As a company that makes and manufactures devices, as well as uses manufactured goods in our campuses, datacenters, and operations, we have an obligation to responsibly source materials and an opportunity to build a more circular approach into our work and the world."
"To reach our commitment to become a zero waste company by 2030, we are taking an increasingly circular approach to materials management to reduce waste and carbon emissions."
Our strategy goes beyond waste diversion as we work across our value chain beginning with design and material selection.
"Wherever possible, we reduce the amount of materials needed."
"We responsibly source materials for our operations, products, and packaging."
"We are increasing the use of recycled content, selecting recyclable or compostable materials, reducing hazardous substances, and designing out waste."
"We keep products and materials in use longer through reuse, repair, and recycling programs."
"Our com mitment: zero waste by 2030 across our direct waste footprint Increasing reuse of servers and components through Circular Centers By 2025, 90 percent of servers and components within our regional datacenter networks will be reused."
"Eliminating single-use plastic By 2025, we will eliminate single-use plastics in all Microsoft primary product packaging and all IT asset packaging in our datacenters."
"Making fully recyclable products and packaging We will design Surface devices, Xbox products and accessories, and all Microsoft product packaging to be 100 percent recyclable in OECD countries by 2030."
Driving to zero waste operations We will achieve 90 percent diversion of operational waste at datacenters and campuses and 75 percent diversion for all construction and deconstruction projects by 2030.

"64 Getting to zero waste To meet our commitment to being zero waste by 2030, we are reducing, reusing, and diverting waste in our campuses and datacenters."
We are also focused on keeping our products and packaging in use longer by designing for circularity.
Campuses and datacenters Our operations are a considerable part of our waste footprint.
"Getting to zero waste requires more ambitious efforts to reduce as much waste as we can, reuse products to extend use life, and recycle or compost wherever possible, as well as thinking through everything from visitor badges to server racks with circularity in mind."
"Building a circular cloud At Microsoft, we have taken a first-of-a-kind approach towards designing and implementing circularity into our cloud, aligning our end-of-life dispositioning processes with an integrated plan across the entire supply chain."
It starts with sustainable design and responsible sourcing of an asset.
"We use our assets as long as we can effectively, then reuse what we can to extend hardware life."
"After decommissioning, we move towards a diversified approach, ensuring that assets are dispositioned to optimize value, security, compliance, and sustainability."
"Over the past year, we engaged new suppliers who are able to remanufacture assets and components, effectively enabling new lifecycles for our assets."
"We have successfully demonstrated takeback/ buyback models with our original asset suppliers, closing the loop on assets and enabling suppliers to repurpose or reuse assets and components, returning higher financial benefits as well as significant sustainability outcomes for carbon emissions reduction and material recovery."
We have built Circular Centers inside our large datacenter campuses to intercept and process all decommissioned assets.
"These include an intelligent disposition and routing system using Azure SQL, Power BI, and Embedded Power Apps integrated with Dynamics 365, which determines the optimal route for every component, creating a plan for every part, extending useful lifecycles well beyond the datacenter, and engaging our upstream and downstream suppliers."
Reusing datacenter hardware via Circular Centers.
"The Ci r cular Centers are also a significant contributor to our sp ares program, using harvested components from decommissioned assets to repair cloud hardware."
"Increasingly, such approaches are creating more value and enabling greater resilience across our supply chain."
"Our circular cloud will enable 90 percent reuse of datacenter hardware by 2025, significantly contributing to our goal of achieving zero waste datacenters by 2030 and goal of more than 50 percent emissions reduction by 2030."
Reusing cloud hardware via Circular Centers A critical piece of achieving our zero waste goal is managing e-waste from our growing datacenters.
"Last year, we piloted a new approach to asset reuse by building a Circular Center within our Amsterdam datacenter campus, which represents 7 percent of our server capacity globally."
"We process decommissioned cloud hardware to service strategic routes, secondary markets, and suppliers, using intelligent routing software in combination with Dynamics 365."
90% Our circular cloud will enable 90 percent reuse of datacenter hardware by 2025.
"65 66 Getting to zero waste (continued) Over the past year, our Amsterdam Circular Center model has achieved 83 percent reuse and 17 percent recycling of cloud hardware."
"Based on the success of the pilot, were exp anding to five additional campuses in the US (Boydton , Chicago, Quincy), EMEA (Dublin), and APAC (Singapore) regions, and extending this model to most of our cloud computing assets."
"This program should achieve 90 percent reuse by 2025 with projected savings of approximately $100 million each year, once scaled."
"We also sei zed opportunities to become more resilient, build better ties with communities, and increase collaboration with upstream and downstream partners."
"Were bridging the skills divide in our datacenter communities by supporting technical training programs at community colleges, vocational schools, and other education institutions."
This work depends on decommissioned and excess datacenter equipment to facilitate the hands-on labs called Datacenter Academies in datacenter communities.
Zero waste datacenters Microsoft has a goal to achieve 90 percent diversion of datacenter operational waste by 2030.
"To reach this goal, were working closely with our waste haulers to optimize waste diversion programs across our global datacenter portfolio."
"Were also partnering with third-party industry experts to investigate options for hard-to-recycle materia ls, such as air filters used in our datacenters."
Explori ng innovative partnerships and solutions to reduce waste and transition to a circular economy are key strategies for achieving our 2030 goal.
"In FY21, we achieve d Zero Waste certifications for our San Antonio, Texas and Q uincy, Washington datacenters and renewed certifica tions for our Boydton, Virginia and Dublin, Ireland l ocations."
75% Our goal is 75 percent construction and deconstruction waste diversion for all projects.
"90% Our goal is 90 percent waste diversion for campus projects over 75,000 square feet."
Zero waste campuses Weve created a roadmap for key zero waste initiatives for each camp us and committed to Zero Waste certifications by 2030 for a ll Microsoft campuses.
"LinkedIns new campus in Omaha opened in 2021 with a focus on zero waste, which led to the team utilizing reclaimed wood wherever possible, including tabletops, lockers, and stairs."
52 percent of the wood on the project is reclaimed and the rem aining 48 percent is FSC certified.
"Construction waste diversion Microsoft has a goal of 75 percent construction waste diversion for all projects and 90 percent for campus projects over 75,000 square feet."
"To reach these goals, Microso ft and LinkedIn are refining RFIs for vendors, standar dizing waste tracking and reporting, and establishing a decommissioning partner to ensure that our used furniture and materials are reused."
Our Puget Sound campus modernization project included deconstructing 12 existing buildings.
"We found mu ltiple reuse opportunities, including using concret e waste for temporary roads and fill for the new campus, a nd recycling ceiling and carpet tiles into new tiles."
Our Puget Sound project is currently achieving over 90 percent diversion.
"Reducing waste in campuses Last year, we began the rollout of recyclable paper visitor badges to Microsoft sites globally, which will help avoid seven tons of plastic waste annually."
"Additionally, were establishing new programs to reduce food waste, other single- use plastics, and virgin finite materials."
"Across Asia, sites lik e Singapore are utilizing sustainable meal boxes to cut down on w aste generation."
"Similarly in Japan, a new reusable cup initiative launched in July 2020 has complet ely phased out disposable cups and is estimated to potentially save 960,000 paper cups annually."
"Our Istanbul site is using solar powered compost tanks to reduce waste by 1,000 kg each month."
Our Puget Sound modernization project is currently achieving over 90 percent construction waste diversion.
Getting to zero waste (continued) Devices Zero waste for our devices and packaging means taking a circular economy approach to design out waste and keep materials in use longer.
"We are extending the lifespan of our devices through programs like Design for Repair; we are designing our devices and packaging to use fewer materials and to be increasingly recyclable; and we are supporting reuse, repair, refurbishment, and recycling infrastructure to ensure that Microsoft devices are kept in use longer."
"Were also increasing use of recycled material in our own devices, accessories, and packaging."
"Shifting to recycled materials Ocean plastics In October 20 21, we launched the Ocean Plastic Mouse which has a shell made with 20 percent recycled ocean plastic, the fi rst consumer electronics application of this material."
"G oing beyond just ocean-bound plastic, which is plastic that is collected within 50 km from shorelines, each mouse contains resin made from recycled water bottles taken directly out of oceans, beaches, and waterways."
The launch of th e Ocean Plastic Mouse is a small step on our longer journey to use innovative recycled materials.
The resin is now available for others to use in their own products to help address the global challenge of ocean plastic.
"Post-consume r recycled plastic Over the pas t year, we have used more post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics in our products, including Surface power supply units, Surface devices, Xbox consoles and controllers, and PC accessories."
"With the new E lectric Volt and Daystrike Camo Special Edition controllers, we incorporated 30 percent PCR resins into the external housing and 50 percent PCR in the inter nal midframe for the first time in any Xbox hardware."
"Following in their footsteps came the Aqua Shift cont roller, four variations of the Space Jam New Legacy con trollers, and our Xbox Design Lab series of controllers."
"These controllers contain a portion of resins made from recycled materials like automotive headlight covers, plastic water jugs, and CDs."
Our testing shows the materials provide the same controller durability and performance gamers have come to expect.
"With the re-launch of our Xbox Design Labs, we have incorporated the same PCR resins into 75 percent of all Xbox Design Lab controllers."
"Starting i n late 2021, Xbox Series S became our first console to i ncorporate PCR resins into the manufacturing of the body and various internal components."
"To date, we have incorporated approximately 28 percent PCR into the products overall design without compromising quality or durability."
We are now investigating ways to incorporate more PCR into the design along with reducing wall thickness to utilize less material overall.
Zero waste for our devices and packaging means taking a circular economy approach to design out waste and keep materials in use longer.
"Post-industrial recycled materials We are developing opportunities to reuse manufacturing scrap in aluminum production, allowing us to use lower-carbon, 100 percent post-industrial recycled closed loop aluminum for future Surface computer housings."
"For our neodymium magnets, a rare earth material, we are also exploring post-industrial scrap as a manufacturing feedstock, which would enable us to produce 100 percent recycled neodymium in magnets for future products."
Repurposed inventory Textiles at Microsoft are normally used on Surface palm rests and type covers.
"However, given the unique challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experimented with scrap Alcantara fabric and repurposed it into a product engineered to be a reusable, premium, and comfortable three-layer face covering for Microsoft employees."
The Ocean Plastic Mouse is the first consumer electronics application of recycled ocean plastic.
"67 Reducing waste in production Traditionally, many materials used in the production of devices are made using industry-standard computer numerical control (CNC) manufacturing."
"With CNC, the shape of the product component is cut out of a large block of raw materials after which the excess is discarded."
"To reduce waste in production, we have started to introduce material stamping techniques in our manufacturing which instead mold the raw materials to the desired end shape."
"For our new Surface Laptop Studio, stamping reduced our manufacturing aluminum scrap rate for the products base by at least 25 percent."
Enabling repair Repairability and serviceability can extend the lifespan of our devices.
"In 2021, our Design for Repair engineering program helped launch the Surface Pro 8, the Surface Laptop Studio, and Surface Laptop SE, which are considered to be some of the most repairable devices in their product lines with replaceable displays, batteries, keyboards, and more."
"We have also established a growing Authorized Service Provider (ASP) network to expand customer repairs across countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, and France."
"We recently partnered with iFixit to offer service tools for Surface devices to iFixit Pro independent repairers, Microsoft Authorized Service Providers, Microsoft Experience Centers, and Microsoft Commercial customers which can be purchased directly from iFixit."
"Our goal is to continue to expand safe, secure, and sustainable repair options for our Surface and Xbox devices."
"Microsoft has also committed to hiring an independent consultant to conduct a study on the sustainability benefits of repairable Surface and Xbox devices, including impacts on carbon emissions and waste."
Microsoft will publicly post a summary of our findings on our website by May 2022.
"Designing for recyclability Sustainable packaging As we make progress on our 100 percent recyclable packaging goal for all devices by 2030, our Ocean Plastic Mouse and new Surface Slim Pen, available in 2021, are the first of our products to ship in 100 percent recyclable and plastic-free packaging."
"The Ocean Plastic Mouse packaging is comprised of 20 percent wood fiber, which is sustainably forested, and 80 percent Bagasse fiber, a fast-growing and highly regenerative bio-renewable material."
The packaging for our holiday 2021 Surface products such as Surface Duo 2 and Surface Pro 8are 99 percent recyclable on average.
"And, starting with our Surface Laptop 4 packaging launched in April 2021, all of our new packaging is made with 100 percent sustainably forested content as certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)."
"We also eliminated a single-use plastic product, converting our Xbox gift cards from plastic to paperboard, reducing over 500,000 kg of plastic annually."
Recyclable devices Driven in large part by both materials selection and designing for disassemblya natural byproduct of designing for repairwe produced a Surface Laptop 4 (metal version) that is 93 percent recyclable in OECD countries by UL standard ECVP 2789.
Our Xbox Series X and S were also found to be 97 percent recyclable as a part of Microsoft expanding its recyclability commitment to also include Xbox and Xbox accessories.
"Complex flame retardants, additives, and polymer grades used in consumer electronics make recycling of many plastics at end-of-life difficult."
Microsoft is collaborating with suppliers in the industry to explore a closed loop supply chain for these difficult-to-recycle materials.
"Using end-of-life plastic material from Xbox consoles, PC accessories, and more, weve created a new closed-loop recycled resin that is being evaluated for use in upcoming products."
"Responsible end-of-life We have focused on enabling responsible end- of-life with o ur devices, processes, and materials."
"To ensure products are kept in use longer, Microsoft and our partners work to repurpose or recycle used devices through several programs while encouraging consumers to engage with recycling programs in their own communities."
"Examples include Microsofts Devices Trade-In Program , our Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher Program (MAR) , and our voluntary mailback recycling program ."
100% Packaging for Ocean Plastic Mouse and Surface Slim Pen are 100 percent recyclable.
"500,000 kg We eliminated a single-use plastic product, reducing over 500,000 kg of plastic annually."
75% of all Xbox Design Lab controllers now utilize post-consumer recycled plastic.
"Getting to zero waste (continued) 68 Driving transformation We believe that Microsofts most important contribution to waste reduction will come not from our own work alone, but by helping our customers, partners, and suppliers around the world reduce their waste footprints through our learnings and with the power of data, AI, and digital technology."
"Implementing a circular model that minimizes waste requires interventions up and down the value chaininnovative design, materials, service business models, reuse and redistribution processes, collection, processing, and more."
"To achieve multipl e uses for a material, many of these levers need to be used at once and require coordination with a diverse set of stakeholders."
Technology can play a role in bringing dat a transparency of material flows and connectivity for bu siness and consumer engagements.
"We believe that Microsofts most important contribution to waste reduction will not come from our own work alone, but by helping our customers, partners, and suppliers around the world reduce their waste footprint through our learning and with the power of data, AI, and digital technology."
"That said, our own ope rations are our best laboratory for innovation."
"In FY21, we invested to digitize waste data across the comp any and identified opportunities to improve data collec tion."
"We used Microsoft technology to track and report on materials and waste, developing PowerApps for facility managers, APIs to directly connect with recycling vendors, Dynamics 365 to aggregate bulk data, and the Power BI platform to visualize data across portfolios."
"We now have more consistent, high-quality data about the amount of waste, the type and quality, where it is generated, and where it goes, informing strategy to achieve our targets."
"Customers and partners We are dedicated to using our technology to help customers, partners, and suppliers around the world reduce their waste footprints through our learnings and with the power of data, AI, and digital technology."

"70 Enabling systems change We are focused on new ways to harness the power of technology, partnerships, and investments to drive impact at scale and pace to help the world more effectively transform to a circular economy."
Circular materials management requires all stakeholders to participate in the transition from discarding materials to reusing them.
Appropriate infrastructure and technology are important factors needed to actualize this vision while minimizing environmental impact.
"To enable and accelerate the circular economy, the world must consider what materials are used, how goods are manufactured, how products are used and reused, how and where materials are collected at end-of-life, and how they are brought back into the supply chain."
Circular materials management requires the transition from discarding materials to reusing them.
Funding innovation via CIF The Climate Innovation Fund (CIF) invests in technologies and processes that can reduce the amount of waste generated by repurposing waste into other usable materials and products and enabling the continuous safe use of natural resources.
"In 2021, we invested in Rheaply , a technology-enabled p latform that brings together companies, government, educational institutions, and more to generate increased visibility and circularity of physical assets."
Rheaply allows for transfers of materials that may otherwise go to waste and is building insights around waste diversion and embodied carbon emissions saved on the platform.
"In FY21, we kicked off an internal pilot with Rheaply to better understand the opportunity for creating an internal hardware reuse program."
"We aim to extend the life of internal hardware turned in for recycling, creating a standardized, scalable, traceable, and circular program for our assets prior to responsibly recycling."
"We are also seeing impact from our 2020 Closed Loop Partners fund investments, including the following developments in their portfolio."
"Turning waste into clean energy HomeBiogas (HBG), based in Israel, is a leader in developing affordable, simple-to-use biogas systems, enabling people and businesses around the globe to turn their own organic waste into renewable energy and liquid fertilizer on site."
A typical household can save six tons of CO 2 emissions a year with the entry-level biogas system.
"HBG serves over 10,000 households across more than 100 countries."
"The company has improved the circularity of the products themselveslengthening the shelf life to over 15 years, and making the materials used for the digester 100 percent recyclable."
"Closed Loop Partners, an early investor of HBG, currently represents the largest ownership stake in the company, which currently trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange."
"8 Providing a model for circular economy infrastructure Balcones Resources, the largest privately held recycling company i n Texas, became the Closed Loop Leadership Funds inaugural investment in October 2019."
"As part of Balcones growth strategy to build best-in-class recycling operations across the southern United States, the company closed a bolt-on acquisition of Single Stream Recyclers (SSR) in 2020."
SSR is the first AI-powered recycling company in the United States.
"Balconess facility in Austin, Texas processed 136,000 tons of high-quality recyclable materials in 2020, including 80,000 tons of paper, more than 20,000 tons of glass, and at least 4,000 tons of plastics."
"8 71 Investing in AI Through our AI for Earth program, we are supporting startups an d nonprofits using cloud, data, and AI to accelerat e the pace of innovation in waste, including the following projects."
"Using AI to study the sustainability of housing demolitions and relocations The University of Connecticut is applying AI to detect construction changes between the years of 2014, 2017, and 2020 in Sha nghai, China."
The purpose is to find out whether dem olition and relocation has led to substantial waste of resources.
Seeing trash and targeting local actions using AI Lets Do It Foundation has developed an AI algorithm for detecting trash in geolocated images.
"Today, the algorithm is surveying images all over the world, locating waste on a global scale so that a network of cleanup teams and local municipalities can target the most affected locations."
Using AI and robotics to accelerate the worlds transition to the circular economy.
"Revolutionizing the waste management industry Recycleye uses AI and robotics to revolutionize the waste management industry, accelerating the worlds transition to the circular economy."

Enabling systems change (continued) 72 Driving collective action Transitioning to a global circular economy takes an ecosystem of aligned partners.
"We seek transformational partnerships that help develop and deliver research, guidance, and implementation roadmaps that enable the circular economy."
"Collaborating as a Partner to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation In July 2021, we advanced our relationship with the Ellen Mac Arthur Foundation from Member to Partner, elevating opportunities for Microsoft employees to learn and engage on topics of the circular economy through community platforms, workshops, events, courses, and collaborative projects."
"Leading on packaging innovation In January 2021, Microsoft kicked off a project with members of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Network (including Aquafil, BASF, Berry Global, CHEP/Brambles, Cisco, the Estee Lauder Companies, Flex, Mainetti, Mondi, and SCG) to create a circular packaging solution to replace the existing linear path plastic-based stretch wrap that is used to stabilize and protect products in transit."
"This cross-sectoral group is researching and piloting three different pathways to eliminate single-use stretch wrap used in a linear path: replacing stretch plastic with a compostable film, implementing reusable materials for securing pallets, and improving the recovery of single-use, linear plastic-based film for higher value and closed loop recycling solutions."
The pilots and results will be detailed in a white paper to be published in Q2 of 2022.
"Driving standards with the Capital Equipment Coalition North America In January 2021, Microsoft became a founding member of the Capita l Equipment Coalition North America alongside DLL, GE Digital, Philips, and SAP and in partnership with the U."
S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE).
"We joined the Coalition to support the capital equipment industrys acceleration to a closed loop model that preserves and recovers the value of materials across a products lifecycle, leading to reduced waste and carbon emissions."
"As a group, were working towards circularity standards and methodology that measures the environmental impacts of X as a Service models compared to traditional ownership models."
10 Microsoft is collaborating with 10 other companies to test circular packaging solutions to replace stretch wrap packaging.
"Delivering research, guidance, and roadmaps that enable the circular economy."
"Designing new solutions with Circular Electronics Partnership An alliance of international organizations and their member c ompanies, the Circula r Electronics Partnership is committed to driving a coordinated transition towards a sustainable and economically viable circular industry by creating alignment, avoiding duplication, and stimulating ambitious circular action across the electronics value chain."
"The Partnership builds off the collaboration that produced A New Vision for Circular Electronics and convenes seven global organizations and their respective members: the Global Electronics Council (GEC), the Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE), Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and World Economic Forum (WEF)."
"The partnership is the first time that experts, business leaders, and international organizations will co-design solutions around the circular electronics industry and will establish a network to elevate the action and ambition of the industry in a coordinated way."
Enabling systems change (continued) 73 Key trends 1 Circularity supports decarbonization pathways.
"Implementing circularity activities like purchasing recycled materials, offering a service model, or keeping materials in use longer can reduce the embodied carbon of materials."
Circularity plays a key role in reaching our carbon negative commitment to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by half by 2030.
2 Circularity still lacks common standards needed to scale.
Circular economy initiatives do not share a standard method of measurement across industries or product types and may not always accurately represent environmental impact.
"To scale implementation in the long term, we need the enabling infrastructure to measure, monitor, and verify material origin and flows."
3 Waste data tools optimize quality and time.
"In FY21, we invested to digitize waste data across the company."
"We now have more consistent, higher-quality data about the amount of waste, its type and quality, where it is generated, and where it goes."
"As we implemented waste data tools across the entire company, we saved time collecting and reporting this data from our cross-company sustainability managers to executive leadership, to customers and regulatory bodies."
4 Equity and economy are equally important in a circular economy.
"To date, the primary focus of a circular economy has been on the economy aspect."
"Equity is equally as important, and we need to focus on a just transition for every person, organization, and community."
The world must address the disproportionate effects of upstream resource extraction and downstream waste management and pollution.
It is critical to develop a strategy that ensures under-represented and under-resourced communities are not left behind in the transition to a circular economy.
5 Zero waste roadmaps need site-level adaptability.
Planning for waste interventions must be considered throughout the value chain and by location.
Upstream decisions like procurement and use of materials affect downstream management and processing of materials as eventual waste.
"Location also affects zero waste implementation, and a certain degree of customization can ensure alignment to global efforts while contextualizing the program for local realities."
"While there are best practices that can be shared and replicated on a global scale, there are unique characteristics for each campus, such as its local infrastructure, size, or dining services."
"Creating a localized approach to zero waste drives local ownership and program effectiveness, while also laddering up to a global target."
FY21 was a year of progress and learning for Microsoft on our journey to zero waste.
74 Whats next?
1 Continue towards zero waste by 2030 We will scale programs such as our Circular Centers and the elimination of single-use plastics from packaging for Microsoft products and within our supply chain.
"Across the company, we are using baseline data to inform annual roadmaps that will result in meaningful environmental outcomes for our employees, consumers, and the diverse communities in which we operate."
"2 Build circularity into our contracts We will work upstream to develop better materials, including recycled materials, and ensure contracts are in place to support circular processes."
We are also contracting with suppliers to engage in reverse logistics models and take-back programs for waste reduction and reuse of packaging materials.
"From downstream waste haulers, we are contractually requesting data transparency, optimization of services, and waste sorting education to promote zero waste outcomes."
3 Use our voice to align waste and circularity standards We will help to drive standardization across circularity standards within the Capital Equipment Coalition and use our voice to coalesce industries towards a set of principles to promote circular economy progress.
"There is an opportunity for cross-industry collaboration for waste and circularity data standards, including a framework for capturing reliable and consistent data and methodologies."
"4 Implement circularity to reduce embodied carbon We are continually exploring design changes, material selection, and business processes to facilitate deep embodied carbon reductions across our operations and products."
"We are analyzing the optimal use of conventional materials, such as concrete and steel, and pursuing more ambitious opportunities with emerging alternative materials that carry significantly less embodied carbon."
"5 Advance waste data tools Building on our FY21 work to transform our waste accounting, we will continue to improve our waste data tools so they more accurately model business activity."
The ability to forecast environmental impacts will drive upstream sustainable decision-making that minimizes waste and associated carbon emissions.
"It will also help us understand the environmental impacts of circularity practices like reuse, repair, redistribution, and recycling."
"We are exploring the best methods to account for this, such as measuring the per-year and absolute carbon footprint of a product."
"6 Increase employee engagement In FY22, as new recycling initiatives are deployed at the Circular Centers, we are focused on further iterating operational procedures and training for zero waste practices."
"We are also building design guidelines for engineers that define principles for circular, low-carbon hardware."
75 Whats next?
"(continued) 7 Expand our circular strategy in devices Our work around recycled content, repairability, recyclability, and material efficiency continues to grow."
Our framework for circularity will account for each phase of the device lifecycle and align with leading industry reporting standards and forthcoming circularity legislation.
"We will also continue expanding programs, such as the Microsoft mailback program, to ensure consumers around the world have access to an easy, convenient, and free service for returning their Microsoft branded devices and packaging for reuse, refurbishment, or recycling."
"By the end of FY22, Microsoft plans to implement the mailback program in 40 countries."
"8 Scale the circular cloud We are deploying new Circular Centers in Dublin, Chicago, and Singapore by July 2022."
"We also plan to launch a Circular Center in Quincy, Washington in 2022, followed by Sweden in 2025."
"Working with our internal and external partners, we will develop new dispositions that maximize reuse and minimize waste."
"In addition, we are exploring additional circularity functionality, such as harvesting for spares and warranty reuse, scaling buyback to network hardware, and providing recycling support all of which can be performed at the Circular Centers."
We are also working with our logistics packaging partners to reduce single-use plastic in packaging and transition to recyclable and compostable packaging.
We are focused on further iterating operational procedures and training for zero waste practices.

77 Ecosystems Only when we have a massive amount of planetary data and compute at a similar scale can we begin to answer one of the most complex questions ever posedhow do we manage natural resources equitably and sustainably for a prosperous and climate-stable future?
"Dr. Lucas Joppa, Chief Environmental Officer Contents Our approach 79 Taking responsibility for our land footprint 81 Driving transformation 82 Enabling systems change 84 Key trends 87 Whats next?"
88 Resources 89 78 Our approach A commitment to protect more land than we use and build a Planetary Computer The context Healthy ecosystems are critical for a healthy planet environmental sustainability cant exist without ecosystem sustainability.
"Unhealthy ecosystems, created or exacerbated by climate change and biodiversity collapse, threaten our entire civilization."
"And yet, according to the latest United Na tions Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES-8) study, the health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than previously thought."
"Put simply, we are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health, and quality of life worldwide."
Microsoft r ecognizes that ecosystems are the thread that connects all our sustainability commitments.
"Ecosystems are where we invest in carbon sequestration projects that help us achieve carbon negativity, they are the watersheds we commit to protect and replenish, and they are where waste is ultimately diverted."
"We need a strong, efficient, scalable way to monitor, understand, measure, and ultimately manage the impact of our actions or inactions on ecosystemsboth globally and locally."
"In the past year, Microsoft has made considerable progres s towards its leading ecosystem commitments of protecting more land than we use and delivering our Planetary C omputer to provide access to the worlds critical environmental datasets and to function as a computing platform that enables partners to measure, monitor, model, and manage healthy ecosystems."
Our commi tment: protect more land than we use by 2025 and build a Planetary Computer Building a Planetary Computer We will aggregate environmental data from around the world and put it to work through computing and machine learning in a new Planetary Computer.
Using our voice on ecosystem-related public policy issues We will support and advocate for public policy initiatives that measure and manage ecosystems at the national and global scale.
Taking responsibility for our land footprint We will take responsibility for the ecosystem impacts of our direct operations by protecting more land than we use by 2025.
Empowering partners and customers around the world We will use the Planetary Computer to develop and deploy the digital technology that helps our partners and customers with environmental decision-making in their organizational activities.
"79 11,000 Microsoft land use footprint is (100 percent of land use) acres 17,268 of total land contracted to protect in FY21 (150 percent of land use) acres FY21 Our approach (continued) Our progress > 17,000 acres In FY21, we contracted to protect more than 17,000 acres of land."
"This puts us on a path to exceed our commitment to protect more land than we use by more than 5,000 acres."
">500 Planetary Co mputer users The Planetary Computer private preview released as planned in April 2021, with more than 500 users signed up and using the APIs and scalable compute."
"24 petabytes of data We have made available 24 petabytes of data with more than 30 key environmental and Earth observation datasets to Azure in consistent, analysis-ready format that is freely available for use by anyone."
"80 850+ grants Since its inception in 2017, our AI for Earth program has provided more than 850 grants to organizations working in 110 countries around the world, granting more than $20 million in Azure credits."
"Delivered new Planetary Co mputer a pplications We partnered with subject matter experts to use the power of the Planetary Computer to develop a growing set of applications that enable data-driven decision-making for the environment, ranging from conservation planning and forest risks to land cover and classificati on."
"Ecosystems C hart 1 Achieving our target of protecting more land than we use by 2025 In FY21, we contracted to protect more than 17,200 acres, which is 50 percent more than the land we use to operate."
"18,000 16,000 14,000 12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 0 Acres of land Protecting ecosystems Taking responsibility for our land footprint Microsoft directly operates on approximately 11,000 acres of land around the world, and we recognize that our own land footprint has an impact on ecosystems."
We have made a commitment to permanently protect more land than we use by 2025.
We are also looking at ways for our datacenters to integrate and give back to the natural environment.
"Since making this co mmitment in April 2020, we identified two lead ing land protection organizations, the National Fish and W ildlife Foundation (NFWF) within the United States and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) globally, to partner with to achieve our commitment to protect more land than we use."
"We used a data-informed approach to identify ecosystems most at risk, using TNCs last chance ecosys tem framework and NFWFs nationa l landscape conservation framework."
We also prioritize projects that have the support and involvement of local and indigenous populations.
"In FY21, we contract ed for projects that will help protect more than 17,000 acres of land, including the following TNC Belize Maya Forest Project We contributed to the purchase of the Maya Forest land , one of the largest remaining tropical forests in the A mericas outside of the Amazon."
"The approximately 236,000 acres secures a vital wildlife corridor in Central Americas dwindling forests."
"This area is critical for the protection of iconic wildlife species, such as jaguars and ocelots, and pres erves a significant living carbon reserve."
"NFWF Western Big Game Migration Program We contributed to the purchase of permanent conservation eas ements in Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada that will protect the migration corridors for species of greatest conservation need, including mule deer, elk, bighorn sheep, and moose."
"This effort also allows apex predators to thrive, including mountain lions, grizzly bears, and Canada lynx."
Providing contiguous protected lands is crucial for enabling the successful migration of these wide-ranging species.
"Giving back to the natural environment As we expand our operational footprint with new datacenters, ou r approach includes work to find ways for our datace nters to give back to the natural environment."
Understanding how we can provide the same (or better) performance as an intact ecosystem starts with understanding how an ecosystem performs on its own.
"We have begun assessment of ecosystem performance in 12 datacenter regions, to be completed by end of 2021."
"Through this research, we are quantifying ecosystem performance in terms of services including water quantity and quality, air, carbon, climate, soil health, human health and wellbeing, and biodiversity."
"The goal is to renew and revitalize the surrounding arearesulting in mutual, regenerative value for the local community and environment."
"We measur e this in percentages of intact ecosystems, meaning the higher the percentage, the more effective we are at meeting natures benchmark for the area."
"The findings are helping to inform one of our first projects in North Holland, which is part of our Amsterdam datacenter region."
"Around the datacenters, we will construct lowland forested areas as well as forested wetlands, which are highly saturated with water and vegetation suited for water filtration to naturally process storm water and runoff."
Modeled results from these different approaches suggest that ecosystem performance can be restored to as much as 75 percent (where we are able to successfully recreate 75 percent of the function of the untouched ecosystem).
The Maya Forest land is one of the largest remaining tropical forests in the Americas outside of the Amazon.
"5,000 We will exceed our commitment to protect more land than we use by contracting for more land protection, putting us on path to exceed our goal by 50 percent."
"81 Driving transforma tion We believe that Microsofts most important contribution to protecting ecosystems and biodiversity is delivering the Planetary Computer, which provides access to the worlds critical environmental datasets, AI, and digital technology."
"Our land footprint is relatively small, which is why we also focus on using our technology to support ecosystem health."
"We believe that our biggest contribution to the protection of ecosystems is to identify, invest in, and orchestrate a coherent cloud infrastructure that brings together all relevant stakeholders and offers best-in-class science-driven tools, AI, digital catalogs of species, distributed computing frameworks, and global satellite images."
"We make these tools cloud-native, bring our business partners to deploy them to be used, and build trust by making visible the science roots and the provenance of the data, while creating best practices for deployment by deploying ourselves first."
"We are also embracing open source, identifying critical petabytes of satellite images being collected and released as open data, including the Copernicus satellite programs and tools like Marxan."
The manifestation of this work is what we call the Planetary Computer.
"This open-source solution includes data catalogs, APIs, and applications to empower both data scientists and environmental scientists to craft more effective and informed strategies to protect and restore ecosystems."
"Product In April 2021, we released the Planetary Computer , which e nables global-scale environmental monitoring by combining petabytes of data and spatial analysis tools to power sustainability applications."
It is a platform that lets users build on the power of the cloud to accelerate environmental sustainability and Earth science.
"The Planetar y Computer consists of four major components: The Data Catalog , which includes more than 24 petabytes of data about Earth systems, hosted on Azure and made available to users for free."
APIs that allow users to search for the data they need across space and time.
"Instead of sifting through millions of files, we index content so any user can ask directly f or a type of data (for example, give me all data from these satellites for Kansas in summer 2020 when it was not cloudy and give me those times on a specific map projection of the average values)."
This vastly reduces the complexity of dealing with petabytes of data.
"The Hub , a managed computing environment that allows scientists to process massive geospatial datasets."
"To date, we have seamlessly deployed more than 20,000 cluster node workers to support our user workloads."
"Applications , built by our network of partners, that put the Planetary Computer platform to work for environmental sustainability, ranging from conservation planning and forest risk management to land cover classification."
The Sentinel-2 program provides global imagery in 13 spectral bands and a revisit time of five days.
82 The Planetary Computer uses open-source tools and supports open standards.
"In fact, the foundation of the Planetary Computer is the incredible ecosystem of tools being developed in the open by our partners and the much broader open-source community."
"For example, our Hub builds on the work done by the Pangeo community to put the tools of data science to work for the Earth science community, and our API builds on the work done by the STAC community to streamline and standardize the cataloging and discovery of geospatial data."
"The Planetary Computer API and Planetary Computer Hub are currently in private preview, accepting a small set of early users, with plans to go public in mid-2022."
All the datasets are available and can be accessed via Azure Blob Storage.
Datasets can be used by developers working within or outside of our Planetary Computer Hub.
They can integrate each component in their existing processes or use the full Planetary Computer with one single experience.
24 PB We have made available 24 petabytes of data with more than 30 key environmental and Earth observation datasets.
"Driving transformation (continued) Protecting and managing land, oceans, and biodiversity."
"Customers and partners We partnered with subject matter experts to use the power of the Planetary Computer to develop applications that enable data-driven decision-making for the environment, including the following."
"Global land cover maps In June 2021, Esri published a new high-resolution 2020 Global Land Cover map for users around the world."
The 10-Meter Land Cover map is the collaborative result of compute and Sentinel-2 data from the Microsoft Planetary Computer and a novel deep learning AI model developed by Impact Observatory .
"High- resolution, open, accurate, and timely land cover maps are critical for decision-makers in many industry sectors and developing nations, supporting a broad range of sustainability and conservation efforts."
The data is hosted in ArcGIS L iving Atlas of the World and the Planetary Computer .
Ecosystem mapping and monitoring Conservation Science Partners Analytics Lab uses the Planetary Computer to better visualize ecosystem monitoring projects and help make the findings more intuitive and accessible.
"These mapping applications assess wildlife habitat connectivity on working landscapes, anthropogenic impacts to terrestrial landscapes, and changes in forest structure over time."
"Conservation planning with spatial data The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is using the Planetary Computer to protect and manage land, oceans, and freshwater biodiversity for nature and people."
"In partnership with Microsoft, TNC is scaling impact and accelerating conservation with Marxan, a world-leading decision-support software for spatial conservation planning."
Microsoft and TNC are enabling more equitable access to Marxan by bringing it to the cloud with platform development support from Vizzuality.
"Together we are helping people around the world make evidence-based decisions more quickly, inclusively, and transparently to protect the worlds biodiversity."
Risk assessments for forest-based climate solutions CarbonPlan is using the Planetary Computer to enable more transparent and scientifically rigorous evaluation of forest-based climate solutions.
"By shining a light on data from past and future carbon offset projects, procurement programs can better understand the climate risks of carbon credit purchases."
Microsoft used this application to visualize the climate risks of forest carbon offsets to help us manage our carbon removal purchasing program more effectively.
"Carbon sequestration estimates for above-ground stock Chloris Geospatial uses the Planetary Computer to generate their above-ground carbon stock non-commercial product, which gives anyone the ability to analyze forest carbon globally."
"83 Enabling systems cha nge We are focused on new ways to harness the power of technology, partnerships, investments, and policy to drive impact at scale and pace to help the world protect ecosystems and biodiversity."
At Microsoft we know that our actions alone will not be enough to protect ecosystems and biodiversity.
"The world will need new partnerships, solutions, and policies that have the potential to scale rapidly and globally."
"Investing in AI To empower organizations working on environmental challenges, we provide training and access to cloud and AI technologies."
"Since its inception in 2017, our AI for Earth program has provided more than 850 grants to organizations working in 110 countries around the world."
"While initially these grants provided access to Microsoft cloud services and additional training, weve expanded the program to now include the Planetary Computer."
"This past year, we also added new partners that bring significant new capabilities to the program."
We partnered with the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Secretariat to better reach geospatial researchers and practitioners working at the forefront of environmental use cases.
We launched the $1 million GEO-Microsoft Planetary Computer grant program to support early adopters of the Planetary Computer to apply Earth observations to address environmental and societal challenges.
We selected the first eight grant recipients in September 2021 who all received access to the NICFI Satellite Data Program on Azure and launched a second request for proposals in October 2021 in partnership with Planet Labs.
Monitoring to be able to create more effective reforestation plans and monitor reforestation progress.
"Deforestation prediction We partnered with Vale and our Brazilian subsidiary to build PrevisIA, a solution for NGO Imazon that anticipates information on regions with a higher risk of deforestation and wildfires in the Amazon Rainforest through AI."
"The open platform analyzes various data such as topography, land cover, urban infrastructure, official and unofficial roads, and socioeconomic statistics to refine the deforestation risk model and identify the different types of territories threatened by deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest including indigenous lands and conservation units."
All the information is publicly disclosed at a control panel.
"Public bodies, private companies, and civil society can plan and carry out preventive actions, combating and controlling deforestation."
"84 Enabling systems change (continued) People-powered research, using open source and Azure technologies to lower the barriers to entry for scientific discovery."
"Accelerating scientific discovery with crowdsourcing Zooniverse is the worlds largest platform for people - powered research, using open source and Azure technologies to lower the barriers to entry for scientific discovery."
"Researchers upload their images, videos, or audio files like camera trap images of wild animals or satellite imagery of a star and Zooniverses global community of over 2 million volunteers tags, annotates, or transcribes the file to aid classification."
85 Preventing illegal trade of shark and ray products We partnered with Conservation International and the National Parks Board of Singapore to develop a mobile application that helps identify shark and ray species using technology such as computer vision and AI.
This will enable ground inspectors at national borders to rapidly assess and identify shark and ray species and seize products that are suspected to be illegal.
"Protecting coastlines and shorelines We partnered with the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI) to build a solution using remote sensing technologies to detect coastal changes and predict shorelines and water line evolution for the next 10, 20, and 50 years."
"A change detection map assesses the coastal hazards on urban infrastructure and population, including the impact of seawater intrusion on agricultural and food production in the north of Qatar."
Modeling release sites for disease-fighting mosquitoes The World Mosquito Program (WMP) uses Azure to model human population distribution in dengue-endemic areas to determine the best release locations for disease-fighting mosquitoes to stop the spread of deadly dengue fever.
"Through high-resolution satellite imagery, demographics, and climate data the model is trained to provide accurate estimations of spatially-distributed human population density."
This allows WMP experts to easily develop optimal release strategies for Wolbachia mosquitoes.
"Research shows that Wolbachia can sustain itself in mosquito populations without continual reapplication, making this a long-term, cost-effective and self-sustaining approach with no adverse impact on natural ecosystems."
"Enabling systems change (continued) Driving collective action Successful strategies, interventions, and approaches to improve ecosystem health require a great deal of data and collaboration across public and private sectors, as well as civil society."
"We are taking an ecosystem approach to ecosystems, creating or broadening our relationships to provide more people with better access to this critical information."
"UN Biodiversity Lab In 2021, we launched a new partnership with the UN Biodiversity Lab to help connect remote observations, fi eld data, and AI/machine learning tools."
"This work, powered by the Planetary Computer, will enable countries to develop richer environmental accounts and drive better environmental decision-making."
GEO BON Fostering global connections and collaboration will be critical to address climate change.
"In the past year, we broadened our work with the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) to connect with a global network of scientists to enable a scalable approach to expanding and accessing biodiversity information and insights."
"CSIRO Were supporting CSIRO in Australia to establish a climate intelligence platform that puts trusted and credible climate risk science in the hands of businesses in Australia and the Asia region and enables them to assess, disclose, and manage their climate risks."
"In addition, together with CSIRO and the University of Reading, we have developed a research partnership to improve our understanding and assessment of climate change risk."
"Radiant Earth The Rad i ant Earth Foundation develops Earth observation machine learning libraries and models through an open-source hub to support global missions like agriculture, conservation, and climate change."
"We support Radiant Earth by co-building some of the key software libraries, making it easy to bridge to and from the Planetary Computer."
We are also jointly running competitions to improve machine learning models.
"OS-Climate We continue to support the OS-Climate initiative, which is accelerating the development of scenario- based predictive analytic tools and investment products that manage climate-related risk and finance climate solutions across every geography, sector, and asset class."
"Microsoft is a founding member, contributes our expertise on climate risk and data, and provides additional technology support for the development of new tools and approaches."
"C4IR In 2020, Microsoft joined the World Economic Forums Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network for ocean innovation and technology in Norway (C4IR Ocean)."
"Since then, we have expanded our work with a new project that has us working with C4IR Ocean to deliver a tracking application for maritime vessels to forecast GHG emissions from maritime transportation."
"This information is made available through C4IRs Ocean Data Platform for regulators, finance institutions, and port and coastal authorities to enable data-driven decisions related to the environmental impact of shipping."
Successful strategies to improve ecosystem health require data and collaboration across public and private sectors.
Advocating for healthy ecosystems and biodiversity Governments play a unique and important role in measuring and managing ecosystems and biodiversity as they collect and make publicly available massive amounts of data critical to environmental science.
"They also own billions of acres of public land that they can use to protect, manage, and restore critical ecosystems."
And they establish and implement policies governing the use and management of natural resources and ecosystems.
Advocating for policies that advance measuring and managing biodiversity and ecosystems Microsoft submitted comments to the USDA on ways to advance climate-smart agriculture and forestry.
Microsoft is advocating for the US Congress to pass the Growing Climate Solution Act to advance climate-smart agriculture and nature-based carbon markets.
"In addition, Microsoft supported funding in the Washington state budget to develop high-quality nature-based carbon removal protocols."
Microsoft serves on the steering committee of the US chapter of Trillion Trees and submitted one of the initial corporate pledges.
We have been working with the organizers on ways to design the initiative in a way that accelerates reforestation and meaningfully removes carbon.
"In Europe, Microsoft supported and engaged on the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, that aims to increase protected areas across the EU and to identify new measures for managing and restoring ecosystems."
"Microsoft also committed to support a new dedicated European Biodiversity Partnership, Biodiversa+ , that will bring toge ther science, policy, and practice, and support data-driven research to stop the loss of biodiversity."
86 Key trends 2021 was a year of progress and learning for Microsoft on our journey to delivering the Planetary Computer.
1 The volume and variety of spatial data continues to grow exponentially.
"Whether its satellites in the sky or sensors on the ground, data about the Earth is being captured at higher resolutions, more often, with a variety of data formats and purposes."
"There is also a growing set of model output and derived products which are large spatial datasets themselves, valuable to a broad set of use cases."
This creates a deluge of data waiting to be unlocked for positive environmental sustainability impact.
2 Data providers are eager to make their data more accessible for environmental sustainability use cases.
The organizations that are producing spatial data know whats at stake for our ecosystems.
"They want to see their data utilized to meet the sustainability challenges we are facing and work together to enable users to utilize the data in a common, interoperable manner."
3 Getting data to the cloud is the only way to scale the work of a broad range of users.
Data that exists in the cloud has a huge advantage over data that must be first downloaded on a users system.
"Unless you own a supercomputing system, there is no way to download and compute over the vast amount of data needed to scale the analyses and operationalization of that data."
4 Finding and sharing data about the Earth remains a huge challenge.
Users need to search the vast amount of data available to find the data they need and have easy access to data in the areas and times they care about.
Just because data is available does not mean it is accessible.
There is a growing effort in the geospatial community to enable access to cloud-hosted data through utilizing cloud-optimized formats and supplying APIs to search through standards-based metadata.
"5 Open data, open source, open science, and open standards are critical to collaboration."
The scope of the problems facing our world mean that no one organization or person will be able to solve them.
"The easier it is for governments, academia, and industry to work together, the faster we can all move in the same direction."
"The best mechanism currently for this collaboration is doing things in the open: publishing open datasets, using and investing in open-source software, publishing open science, and making data accessible through open standards."
87 Whats next?
1 Make publishing and using spatial data in the cloud simple We are developing features in the Planetary Computer that will make it easy to push data to the cloud and open access to some or all users.
"2 Solve data access challenges for science and operational applications Enabling efficient geospatial workflows on Azure will unlock the power of the massive amount of data the world is collecting about our Earth to monitor, model, and manage Earths natural systems."
"The Planetary Computer will solve the core data access problems for planetary scale problems, ranging from scientific research to enterprise-grade applications, so that developers building applications on top of it can focus on what makes their solutions unique."
"3 Expand the catalog of datasets hosted in the Planetary Computer We are continuously identifying and onboarding high-value, openly licensed datasets for broad usage in the Planetary Computer."
We are improving our pipelines to reduce the latency between data becoming available and being findable and usable in users existing workflows.
4 Support the growing ecosystem of applications powered by the Planetary Computer We will continue to grow our network of partners developing impactful environmental sustainability applications using the data and services of the Planetary Computer.
This includes investing in partners that use technologies like AI to push the boundaries of what is possible and empower their users with the tools they need to make decisions to protect the ecosystems of our planet.
"5 Continue to invest and grow the open-source ecosystem of tools working with Earth science data Microsoft will continue to support the open- source ecosystem of tools that we use to deploy our services and that our users rely on to process, analyze, and operationalize the data of the Planetary Computer."
We will target new domains like climate forecast and biodiversity observation data.

"Management is also responsible for the collection, quantification, and presentation of the specified information included in Section 1 of Appendix D and for the selection or development of the criteria, which management believes provides an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the specified information."
"Management of Microsoft Corporation asserts that the specified information included in Section 1 of Appendix D as of, and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 is presented in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section 1.10, Reporting criteria ."
"1.7 Description of the company and inventory boundary Microsofts environmental sustainability data, which includes GHG emissions, energy, waste, water, and ecosystem metrics, reported for FY21 has been prepared following a fiscal year basis as the reporting period covering the timeframe of July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021."
The Corporate External & Legal Affairs (CELA) Sustainability team within Microsoft under the leadership of the Vice President and Chief Environmental Officer holds the responsibility to monitor and report sustainability environmental data.
"For setting organizational boundaries and for corporate reporting of GHG emissions, energy, waste, and water metrics in Tables 1-9 above, Microsoft uses the operational control approach."
"This includes global wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries over which Microsoft has management and operational control, including Microsoft owned and leased real estate facilities."
Appendix D (continued) 1.8 Information on metrics Microsoft announced in January 2020 that they will be carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050 they will remove from the atmosphere an equivalent amount of all the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by our electricity consumption since being founded in 1975.
This will be achieved by reducing Scope 3 emissions (market-based) by more than half; and by reducing Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions to near zero by the middle of the decade through energy efficiency work and reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2025.
"The baseline year is 2020, which was the year when the announcement was made."
"Microsoft has a metrics recalculation policy for historical data (including base year) to ensure consistency whenever year-over-year structural changes, methodological changes , or other accuracy improvements are significant."
Structural changes include acquisitions and divestitures.
Methodology changes include changes in a calculation methodology or new activity types.
Accuracy improvements include the correction of significant errors or cumulative small errors that together are significant and/or updates to available supplier reported data.
Footnotes under each table will highlight specific adjustments made.
"Microsofts GHG inventory includes five of the seven GHGs add ressed by the Kyoto Protocolcarbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6)."
Microsoft does not currently use or emit perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3).
"The following is a more detailed list of activities included in the GHG in ventory: Scope 1 direct GHG emissions from onsite fossil fuel combustion (including natural gas, propane, fuel oil, and diesel), executive air travel, ground transportation (Microsoft owned and directly leased), h ydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants, and S F6 used at some facilities."
"Sc ope 2 indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity, chilled water, and steam."
"The location-based method is based on average emission factors for the electricity grids that provide electricity to our datacenters, buildings, and campuses."
"The market-based method includes consideration of contractual arrangements under which Microsoft procures power from specific suppliers or sources, such as renewable energy."
"In the market-based method, we also capture the impact from direct renewable energy and the purchase of unbundled energy attribute certificates (EACs)."
"Scope 3 indirect GHG emissions for the following categories identified as relevant for Microsoft: Category 1 Pu rchased Goods & Services Category 2 Ca pital Goods Category 3 Fu el- and Energy-Related Activities (Location-Based and Market-Based) Category 4 U pstream Transportation Category 5 Wa ste Category 6 Bu siness Travel Category 7 Em ployee Commuting Category 9 D ownstream Transportation Category 11 U se of Sold Products Category 12 E nd of Life of Sold Products Category 13 D ownstream Leased Assets Reported data for water, waste, and ecosystems support the monitoring and tracking of our progress associated with the commitments under each program."
"For carbon removal, the following Microsoft criteria is used to select carbon removals that we contract: Microsoft Criteria for High-Quality Carbon Dioxide Removal ."
"Both third-party certified and uncertified t ons are purchased in an effort to help develop the market, and only certified tons are applied to the carbon neutrality scope (Scope 1, Scope 2 market-based, and business air travel)."
"For the certified portion, the following validation and verification bodies have provided the certification: Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS), American Carbon Registry (ACR), Climate Action Reserve (CAR), and California Air Resources Board (CARB)."
The reported carbon removal contracted value total also includes future tons that have not yet been delivered.
"For renewable energy, the impact is captured from on-site generation, renewable energy certificates (RECs) and from power purchase agreements (PPAs)."
"The purchases of RECs include: RECs (Green-e certified), guarantees of origin (GO), renewable energy guarantees of origin (REGO), I-RECs, tradable instrument for global renewables (TIGR), J-Credits, large scale energy certificates (LGC) and PowerPlus."
Microsoft procures enough renewable energy to match 100% of its electricity consumption.
"In the case that renewable energy is not procured in the markets where they operate, enough renewable energy from nearby markets is purchased to ensure we maintain the 100% renewable electricity commitment is maintained."
"Microsofts water inventory includes the withdrawal, consumption, and discharge associated with assets under its operational control."
"These volumes represent global enterprise-wide operations including offices, datacenters, labs, and retail."
"This data supports progress tracking against current Water Positive program commitments, as well as future reporting against the newer commitment announced in October 2021 of reducing water waste in datacenter operations by 95 percent by 2024."
"104 Appendix D (continued) Similarly, the waste inventory includes the mass of waste generated from operations within Microsofts operational control that are landfilled, incinerated, recycled, reused, and composted for both non-hazardous and hazardous categories."
This waste inventory supports progress tracking against the commitment of diverting 90% of operational waste at datacenters and campuses.
Reported data for ecosystems includes the total area of land that has been funded and protected based on the presented definition in table 1.10 for reporting criteria.
Microsofts land protection commitment was established in FY20 therefore reported data for FY21 represents progress for the first year.
Currently the waste inventory does not include waste from construction and deconstruction activities.
Reported operational waste does not include impact from business group GitHub.
Data across metrics currently excludes impact from the ZeniMax acquisition completed in March 2021.

"81 Waste generated in operations The waste figure represents emissions from waste disposed via landfi lling, incineration, recycling, and compost."
"Emissions from waste are calculated using methodologies and emission factors from the EPAs Waste Reduction Model (WARM), version 15."
"This model bases its emissions calculations on a lifecycle analysis, including emissions from the long-term decomposition of waste in a landfill or from upstream sources/sinks."
"GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average."
"37 Business travel Historically, this category has included emissions from commercial air trav el only."
"FY20 (reporting year) was the first year that additional business travel emissions sources were included, including hotel night stays, rail travel, reimbursed mileage, rental cars, and taxi/rideshares."
"For commercial air and rail travel, Microsoft Corporate Travel provides flight/ ride-level airport codes and cabin class data."
"The airport/rail station codes are used to calculate distances to determine whether the flights/ rides were short, medium, or long haul."
"Using the distance-based method, flight distances and cabin class are used to calculate CO2e emissions, using the appropriate emission factors from: 2020 Guidelines to Defra/DECC's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting)."
"For hotel night stays, Microsoft's preferred hotel vendors provided emissions per hotel night stay coefficients."
"For other hotel chains, emissions were estimated based on nights stayed and the emission factors from the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance: Indirect Emissions from Events and Conferences (Dec 2018)."
"For rental cars, mileage, fuel, and emission data was provided from each rental car company."
"For taxi/rideshare and reimbursed mileage, emissions were estimated based on spend using emission factors from EPA Emission Factor Hub."

64 * Represents the percentage of emissions calculated (by category) using data obtained from suppliers or value chain partners.
Supplier data percentage*107 Scope 3 category Emissions calculation methodology Supplier dat a percen tage* Employee commuting This category captures emissions from commuting by all employees and con tractors that work in Microsoft buildings.
"Microsoft conducted a survey in May 2019 to capture detailed commuting habits from employees and vendors at our Puget Sound campus, representing ~36% of global Microsoft headcount."
The survey is typically conducted ann ually but was not performed in 2021.
The results were scaled to estimate global commuting emissions for Microsoft.
CO2 emission rates for passenger vehicles (single occupancy vehicle [SOV] and carpool) are based on fuel consumption and miles travelled.
"A weighted average fuel economy using the 2012 EPA Fuel Economy Trends Report 19752012 was derived, which provides combined fuel economy for cars and trucks by year, and a set of car and truck age fractions provided by the Puget Sound Regional Council."
This data was used to develop a weighted average fuel economy for the Puget Sound area.
Emission factors are derived from the Inventory of US.
"Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 19902010, Annex 2 (Methodology for estimating CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion)."
"CO2 rates per passenger mile are based on Federal Transit Administration, 2010 (Public Transportations Role in Responding to Climate Change, US DOT, Federal Transit Administration, January 2010)."
"GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average."
"As nearly all Microsoft employees worked from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, FY20 was the first year to include emission impacts from telework."
"Telework energy consumption is assumed to include workstation/plug-load energy usage, additional lighting and household cooling/heating consumption."
"1 laptop, 2 monitors and 3 lightbulbs are assumed for each employee; other assumptions include 8 work hou rs/day and 250 days/year using the devices."
Office/workspace floor area and cooling/heating intensity are assumed based on EIAs 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) data.
"From these assumptions, a carbon emission intensity per employee is calculated, and total emissions are calculated by multiplying the intensity by number of employees during the period of remote work."
10 Upstream leased assets Appendix D (continued) Scope 3 category Emissions calculation methodology Not relevant.
Microsoft includes leased assets in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reporting boundary.
"Downstream transp ortation and distribution Included in this category are the emissions from transporting and ware housing of devices Microsoft sold (including, but not limited to, Xbox devices, Microsoft Surface devices, HoloLens, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals) from Microsoft manufacturing sites to retailers and customers."
Calculations are based on standard assumptions of distance between retailers and their distribution centers and warehouse floorspace from an MWPVL International analysis of Walmarts distribution center network.
Assumptions about the energy intensity of warehouses come from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)s Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (2012).
Emission factors for shipping come from the GaBi database.
"GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average."
0 Processing of sold produ cts Not relevant.
Microsoft did not have any physical intermediate products in the y ears reported.
"Use of sold products Included in this category is the lifetime electricity use of devices Microsoft sold i ncluding, but not limited to, Xbox devices, Surface devices, HoloLens, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals."
Lifetime electricity use per device is calculated based on standard product-use assumptions as included in our ISO 14040 and ISO 14044compliant lifecycle analyses.
This year updates to energy use assumptions that reflect latest understanding of device use via telemetry data are also included.
Assumptions on total lifetime expected use (years) are used.
Sales geography for the products sold is used to determine the electricity emission factor used to calculate emissions.
"GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average."
"0 End of life treatment of sold pr oducts Included in this category is the end-of-life treatment of devices Microsoft sold d uring the reporting year including, but not limited to, Xbox devices, Surface devices, HoloLens, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals."
End-of-life emissions for each product are based on modeling within our ISO 14040 and ISO 14044compliant lifecycle analyses.
"To generate an estimate for this category, the model assumes that all devices are sent to landfills at the end of their useful life."
"GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average."
0 * Represents the percentage of emissions calculated (by category) using data obtained from suppliers or value chain partners.
"Supplier data percentage*108 Scope 3 category Emissions calculation methodology Supplier dat a percen tage* Downstream leased assets Emissions associated with sublets are calculated using the intensities deri ved from data collected for the primary leased space (for example, kilowatt-hours/square foot [kWh/SF]) and prorated for the square foo tage of the sublet space."
"In this way, it is assumed that the emissions intensities of the leased spaces are the same as the overall buildings in which they reside."
Estimated refrigerants are calculated using the same methodology and intensity as used to calculate refrigerant intensities for assets occupied by Microsoft.
"Electricity emission factors used are those appropriate to each location, as utilized in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 location-based inventory."
"GWPs are from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), 100-year average."
0 Fran chises Not relevant.
Microsoft did not operate franchises in the years reported.
Investments Not relevant for reported years.
"Joint ventures, actively managed inve stments, and direct equity investments totaled less than 2 percent of Microsofts market capitalization at the end of the reporting period."
Microsoft has not engaged in the long-term financing of projects and the proceeds for each debt issuance have been for general corporate purposes.
Appendix D (continued) * Represents the percentage of emissions calculated (by category) using data obtained from suppliers or value chain partners.
"109 109Appendix D (continued) Water and Waste Primary data is used to calculate water withdrawal, disc harge and consumption, and waste generation where Microsoft operates."
Estimates are used where primary data is not available.
"Water withdrawals are based on data from utility bills fro m our largest sites and, in some cases, estimations."
"An estimation methodology for sites where primary data is unavailable that considers square footage, electricity consumption, and cooling type is used."
"Where discharges and consumption are not metered, amounts are estimated annually as part of the global water inventory aggregation process."
Most of the sites do not have discharge meters.
"A low water consumption at many of the sites is estimated, unless there are specific water consuming activities present."
"Where there is water consumption (such as for landscaping, evaporative coolers, cooling towers, settling ponds), it is estimated that discharge equals the difference between withdrawals and consumption."
Microsoft continues to work on improvements for water consumption data collection.
Operational waste mass is based on data from invoices and /or vendor/third party reports.
"In the absence of actual data, there is an extrapolation methodology."
"Depending on the type of site, the methodology uses capacity (MW) based coefficients by region or attendance to extrapolate waste for those locations where primary data is unavailable."
"This years extrapolation represents an improved methodology, previously capacity based coefficients by equipment technology type and floorspace were used."
All extrapolated waste is assumed to be landfilled in cases where the disposal or diversion method is unknown.
The extrapolation excludes e-waste and is conservative by making landfilled the default assumption for disposition method.
"Year-over-year, waste data continues to improve in that there is a continuous increase in the amount of actual data used in the inventory."
