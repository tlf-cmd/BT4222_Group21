"Leadership Messages Mark ZuckerbergAbout Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 3About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision A Message from Nick Clegg & President of Global Affairs Mark Zuckerberg Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer Were optimistic about the role technology will play in helping us address the climate crisis."
But the task ahead is massive.
"As both a company and a platform for social connection, we take our responsibility seriously."
Well continue our sustainability work across our business and productsand will share our progress through reports like this one.
"At Meta, were building technology that will help shape the next chapter of the internet and the future of social connection."
"These long-term investments are in service of a vision for the future where everyone can be present with each other, create new opportunities, and experience new things."
We view our sustainability work with this same eye to the future.
"After all, the possibilities that our technology will unlock for people only matter if we have a safe and thriving planet."
We think about our work here in three areas: limiting the environmental footprint of our operations and devices; driving climate action with our products; and forming partnerships to scale our impact.
"On our operations, thanks to innovations in our data center and office designs, weve driven up efficiency and driven down our environmental footprint."
But we have more work to do.
Weve achieved net zero emissions in our global operations and set a goal to reach net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030.
"Weve also set an ambitious goal for our global operations to be water positive by 2030, meaning well restore more water than we consume."
"On driving climate action, weve expanded our Climate Science Center to reach millions of people around the world with authoritative information about climate change."
And were working closely with experts to combat false or misleading information.
"On partnerships to scale our impact, we recently announced a joint $925 million commitment alongside Stripe, Shopify, McKinsey, and Alphabet to accelerate the development of carbon removal technologies over the next 9 years."
"This is just one of many ways were collaborating with others across industry, nonprofit, academia, and government to combine forces for greater impact."
Our 2021 Sustainability Report dives deep on the progress were making across these areas.
"As we work to provide people around the world with equitable access to opportunities, weve also committed to upholding the UN Global Compacts Ten Principles and to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals."
Were committed to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights too.
"Sustainability, human rights, economic opportunitythese are all interconnected and were taking a holistic approach to make sure were driving positive change globally."
The defining quality of the metaverse will be a feeling of presencelike you are right there with another person or in another place.
"That feeling of presence is an incredibly powerful tool to build empathy, understanding, and collaboration."
"Students will be able to take field trips to the melting ice caps or a wind farm, without leaving their classroom."
"Journalists will be able to tell immersive, first-person stories of climate refugees that help their audience feel the impact on peoples lives."
Experts from around the world can get together around a virtual table to discuss solutions and advance climate action.
2021 Meta Sustainability Report 4 Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
The surge in traffic we observed on our platforms when the COVID-19 pandemic began demonstrated the ever-growing role Meta plays in keeping people connected across the world.
"Meaningful connections are not possible without a safe and healthy worldone in which diverse experiences are respected, accurate information is amplified over the noise, and bold climate action is truly making a difference."
We can all agree that changes to global temperature and climate present overwhelming challengesboth environmental and social.
"We take our role, and the responsibility that comes with it, seriously."
"At our core, we strive to protect both people and the planet through responsible operations."
"For the last decade, we have invested in ways to make our own operations more water-and energy-efficient with a focus on sustainable solutions for the resources we do use."
"Put simply, we aim to use lessless water and less energyand to reduce unnecessary waste."
"As of 2020, our global operations reached net zero emissions and are supported by 100% renewable energy."
"We are now reaching toward the goals of net zero emissions across our value chain and becoming water positive throughout our operations, aiming to achieve both of these milestones in 2030."
"Although this report looks back on 2021 and all the progress we have made, I cannot help looking forward and thinking about all the questions yet to be answered and the work yet to be done."
One thing that became clear in 2021 as we mapped out our net zero strategy was the difficulty in driving pathways for consistent reductions across our operations for a rapidly growing business.
We know our Scope 3 emissions are increasingand will continue to increase in the near termas we grow to support the global demand for the services we provide.
"For example, to support the infrastructure necessary to connect people around the world, we are building more data centers and networks that will provide capacity and reliability on our platforms, and will enable our transition to the metaverse."
"We will work to address our Scope 3 emissions by optimizing for low carbon in our business decisions, collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions and exploring interventions that decarbonize our broader value chain, both upstream and downstream."
"In addition to focusing on carbon reductions, we realize the need to be innovative and push for new ways to collaborate with others."
"After all, the challenge of reaching net zero is an industry- wide problem, and as an industry, we will need to collectively realize our goals for the climate by working together."
A Message from Rachel Peterson Vice President of InfrastructureAbout Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 5 Our recent investment in Frontier AMC is just one example of our belief that we can do far more for the climate through industry collaborationsand the ways we are working with corporate partners to push for faster advancement of technological carbon removals.
"We continue to partner with leading thinkers to develop new ways to accelerate adoption of sustainable materials and fuels for construction, hardware and transportation."
"Industry leaders, governments and other stakeholders know that Scope 3 emissions are difficult to measure and reduce."
We remain committed to leading internal and external discussions and partnerships to drive industry standards and reductions throughout our value chain.
"Finally, as we look forward, we believe that we must build on achieving our 100% renewable energy goals by optimizing our energy strategy to drive emissions reductions at a grid-scale."
"We will do this by maintaining our commitment to 100% renewable energy; creating innovative approaches to drive emissions out of the sector while improving reliability; and collaborating with peers, grid operators, utilities and other stakeholders to advance the zero emissions, reliable grid of the future."
"Despite the unknowns, from the planning and analysis we completed in 2021, we know our ambitious 2030 targets will require significant shifts in how we build infrastructure, increase operational discipline and invest in existing and emerging nature- based and technological solutions to reduce and remove emissions."
We will work to do all of this while growing our business to meet the demands of tomorrow.
"We are humbled by these challenges and grateful to be part of a community of climate leaders, sustainability-focused organizations, government leaders and committed corporations all coming together to allow us to scale our efforts and enable bold climate action."
This is hard and very important work.
"It is how we will bring the world closer togetherand together, how we will help the world move closer to better."
Switching to a clean economy could raise $2.8 trillion through carbon price revenues and the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies to public investments.
A MESSAGE FROM RACHEL PETERSONAbout Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 6 What is your vision for the future of Metas sustainability strategy?
"We have made a lot of progress over the past decadedriving up efficiency and driving down our environmental footprint, especially in how we design, build and operate our global offices and data centers."
"But, we have so much more important work to do."
"For example, we have worked for years to drive sustainability into our value chain through our responsible supply chain program."
"Metas sustainability strategy in the coming years will be to expand our value chain and partnership programs to Q&A with Edward Palmieri Director of Global Sustainability Edward Palmieri joined Meta in 2010 and served as a member of the companys legal team for many years, while nurturing his passion for environmental justice and sustainability."
"As a new parent, Palmieri decided it was time for a shift in career focus."
"He joined Metas Global Sustainability team as Director, allowing him to merge his work with his passion."
"include working with internal Meta teams and our global partners to fight climate change through emissions reductions and removals, water stewardship and biodiversity projects, and meaningful collaborations to invest in new solutions and scale our work."
Our strategy comes to life through three pillars: 1.
"How We Operateprotecting the well-being of people and our planet through our processes, operations and global supply chain 2."
What We Createamplifying scientists and climate leaders through our products and platforms 3.
How We Collaborateengaging with experts and supporting established initiatives in the climate spaceHow is Meta approaching its journey to net zero value chain emissions?
We embrace our responsibility as a global company to address the climate challenge that impacts us all.
"On our journey to reach net zero emissions across our value chain, we will lead by example while following what science tells us must be done to align with the Paris Agreement."
"We are focusing on reducing our Scope 3 emissions, which means radically changing the way we operate and helping our suppliers to set their own climate targets."
"This work to use less, choose better, embrace low-carbon technology and collaborate with our suppliers will be a very long and complex journey."
"For us, our net zero goal is more than an announcement; it is a program designed to drive real emissions reductions and lasting changes to our infrastructure and supply chain."
How will the metaverse impact sustainability?
"At Meta, we are committed to building tools that make choosing to connect virtually easier than ever."
"And while we are at the beginning of what will be a long and constantly changing journey, we are excited about giving people the ability to choose options that have a smaller environmental impact."
"Still, the metaverse is new and the growth of our business to support the creation of these new tools presents challenges."
"The expansion of hardware, construction and operation of new data centers and other capital goods means that we must continue to drive toward more sustainable construction and operational business practices."
"About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 7 We are now beginning to investigate how we can support our business growth while integrating with low-carbon technology, renewable energy, hardware circularity, reduced water usage and other climate- conscious initiatives included in this report."
"Despite all the progress we are making and our plans for the future, the path to a sustainable metaverse will not always be easy."
"For example, at first, we expect to see an increase in our emissions."
"But, ultimately, the work we are doing during these foundational years will drive the innovation and collaboration across our business that enables us to grow sustainably."
How are the sustainability and human rights agendas connected at Meta?
The shared values and aspirations of the human rights and environmental movements are increasingly apparent.
The primary victims of environmental harm are often marginalized communities where people cannot claim their rights to live in a healthy environment.
Linking our sustainability and Q&A WITH EDWARD PALMIERI human rights agendas at Meta is an important step forward whether that means taking into consideration the populations most impacted by transitioning to a zero-carbon economy or investing in the well-being of workers across our supply chain.
Not only is this the right thing to do but also it signals to our employees and stakeholders that we are committed to protecting the rights we all deserve.
What gives you confidence that Meta can be a driving force for industry change?
Our people and our commitment to real impact at scale give me confidence.
"With the technical and professional talent we have assembled, our team is poised to evolve the way Meta and the technology industry approach sustainability."
Our employees truly care about this.
Sustainability is not an add-on for us.
It is a driving force in itself that motivates innovation in what we do and how we do it.
Our scale also gives me confidence.
"We have the global reach, expertise and platforms to make a meaningful difference in markets."
"We are working to support lower-emissions solutions across our business, which we believe will translate to market availability for others as well."
We are doing this through our own direct investments (like with our renewable energy projects) and through partnerships (like our investments in carbon removal and reduction solutions and technologies).
"In fact, one of the most wonderful things about working in the sustainability field is how collaborative it is."
"When we look at the Open Compute Project, for example, we have seen the power of collaboration."
I know we can do even more to set an example for better technologies and capacity-building in our supply chain.
"At Meta, we are building tools that make choosing to connect virtually easier than ever."
"1,200+ companies have set science-based targets in line with net zero emissions."

"It is about moving fast togetherin one direction as a company, not just as individuals."
"Focus on Long-Term Impact emphasizes long-term thinking and encourages us to extend the timeline for the impact we have, rather than optimizing for near-term wins."
"We should take on the challenges that will be the most impactful, even if the full results will not be seen for years."
Build Awesome Things pushes us to ship things that are not just good but also awe-inspiring.
"We have already built products that are useful to billions of people, but in our next chapter, we will focus more on inspiring people as well."
This quality bar should apply to everything we do.
"Live in the Future guides us to build the future of distributed work that we want, where opportunity is not limited by geography."
"This means operating as a distributed-first company and being the early adopters of the future products we are building to help people feel present together, no matter where they are."
Be Direct and Respect Your Colleagues is about creating a culture where we are straightforward and willing to have hard conversations with each other.
"At the same time, we are respectful, and when we share feedback, we recognize that many of the worlds leading experts work here."
"Meta, Metamates, Me is about being good stewards of our company and mission."
It is about the sense of responsibility we have for our collective success and to each other as teammates.
It is about taking care of our company and each other.

That is why we work with a global network of over 80 independent fact-checking organizations to review and rate content in more than 60 languages.
"To supplement that program, in 2021, we launched the $1 million Climate Misinformation Grant in partnership with the International Fact-Checking Network."
"Through this program, we will fund partnerships and proposals from fact-checkers, climate organizations and solution providers working to combat false and misleading information about climate change."
"Accelerating Access to Accurate Information via the Climate Science Center In 2020, we started working with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide access to science-based and dynamic climate information via the Climate Science Center (CSC) ."
"In 2021, Meta expanded the CSC to more than 150 countries, attracting more than 3.8 million followers."

"About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 27 Expanding Net Zero from our Operations to our Value Chain On our path to net zero value chain emissions in 2030, we are committed to an approach that prioritizes emissions reductions."
"Key strategies to reduce emissions include using fewer new materials by reusing server hardware components and choosing construction materials with a smaller emissions footprint, such as low-carbon concrete."
We began working with a select group of our suppliers in 2021 to calculate and report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
"In 2022, we will provide capacity- building training to our top 100 suppliers on measuring their GHG impact, setting reduction goals and identifying ways to reduce their emissions."
"To address any emissions we cannot reduce, we will remove an equivalent amount of GHG emissions through verified carbon removal projects that prioritize social and environmental benefits."
2021 HIGHLIGHTS Scope 1 covers direct emissions that come from sources that are owned or controlled by Meta.
Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the purchased or acquired energy consumed by Meta.

"About Leadership Highlights How We Operate What We Create How We Collaborate Governance Looking Ahead Data Index Vision 2021 Meta Sustainability Report 42 Data Center Water Efficiency Because data centers rely on water to cool servers and maintain humidity levels, our teams are always looking for ways to reduce our water use."
"One method we use to conserve water is through direct evaporative cooling, which relies on outside air."
"Traditional technologies, like chilled water plants and cooling towers, rely on water to reject heat."
"In areas facing specific environmental challenges, such as high levels of dust, extreme humidity or elevated salinity, using direct cooling could severely impact IT equipment."
"In these cases, we use indirect cooling systems to minimize the risk to our buildings and the servers housed within."
"In partnership with Nortek Air Solutions, we have developed an indirect cooling technology called the StatePoint Liquid Cooling (SPLC) system."
"The first of its kind to be deployed to data centers, SPLC produces cold water instead of cold air."
The system uses less water than a typical indirect cooling system because it uses air to cool water instead of using water to cool air.
"Based on evaluation of our current water use, we have identified winter humidification needs as an area of opportunity to further improve our operating efficiency by optimizing our relative humidity (RH)."
"We piloted the RH adjustment at our data center in Los Lunas, New Mexico, and found by lowering our current 20% minimum RH to 13% minimum RH, we were able to reduce water use by 40% over nine months."
We have rolled out the RH minimum changes across our existing data centers and updated design standards for new construction.

We are working toward harvesting and redeploying components and systems at scale that continue to meet our reliability standards for both critical spares and for integration into new racks.
"In 2021, after many months of planning and conducting internal reliability studies, we focused our attention on the opportunity to extend the lifetime use of memory within our racks."
"Critically, memory is a carbon-intensive component within our infrastructure, and the opportunity to use this resource to its fullest extent is a key net zero strategy to use less and avoid emissions in our upstream supply chain."
"Beyond circularity efforts within our data centers, we also work closely with our downstream partners to find a second life for parts outside of our data centers through secondary markets and to ensure all residual materials are responsibly managed."
"We understand that most of the embedded emissions from our data center infrastructure come from manufacturing, and circularity will be key to improving resource efficiency."
"Starting with design and material selection, we are prioritizing the use of recycled materials in new system designs, in addition to our continued focus on ensuring hardware is easy to disassemble and reuse."

"S. solar and wind projects in our portfolio studied, 96% Energy Storage Demand for electricity varies significantly throughout the day."
Fossil fuel generators can be quickly activated or deactivated to account for these variations.
"Renewable energy technology, like wind and solar, are weather-dependent, so they do not necessarily match the variations in electricity demand on their own."
"However, energy storage can help to smooth the small deviations in energy production on the system to help integrate greater volumes of renewable energy."
"Additionally, to prevent wasted energy when demand is low on sunny or windy days, and to support grid reliability on cloudy, calm days, large-scale storage is critical."
"Adding energy storage to the grid is an important tool that enables utilities to move the electricity produced from a solar project, for instance, into times of the day when sunshine is not available."
"This provides greater reliability and flexibility to the utility system and enables a much lower carbon footprint, as utilities integrate even more renewable energy on their grids."
"Meta is also providing funding for added storage to local utilities, allowing them to prepare for and transition to the zero-carbon grid of tomorrow."
"Near our Los Lunas data center in Valencia County, New Mexico, we partnered with our local utility, Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), to add 50 MW of battery storage alongside the addition of 240 MW of solar through our innovative green tariff."
This unique commercial structure allows customers like us to directly pay for capacity resources like energy storage to offset the need to add nonrenewable energy resources to the system.

"Construction of the 40,000-acre reservoir resulted in the loss of substantial floodplain, riparian hardwood forest and wetland habitat within the Richland and Chambers Creeks watersheds."
The Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area (WMA) was created to help offset habitat loss.
"An extensive wetland treatment system covers over 5,000 acres of the WMA and helps treat raw Trinity River Water before it is delivered to municipal and industrial water users in Dallas-Fort Worth."
"Ducks Unlimited has been working to build wetland habitat at WMA since 1987, constructing over 5,000 acres of wetland so far."
"In 2021, Meta partnered with Ducks Unlimited to fund a new wetland habitat in the Upper Trinity River basin."
"Water from the Trinity River floods this newly created wetland complex during the winter season, providing habitat for a diverse array of shorebirds, waterfowl and raptors."
"The wetlands naturally treat the surface water by filtering out sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus from the water, which flows back into the Trinity River in spring."
This project will restore over 200 million gallons of water annually.
"Mason Lane Ditch Piping Verde River Watershed, Arizona Oak Creek, one of the few remaining perennial streams in Northern Arizona, is a tributary of the Verde River."
It runs through high desert canyons and the famous red rocks of Sedona before joining with the Verde River.
"Oak Creek provides recreation and supports a vibrant ecosystem of mammals, birds and aquatic species, including the endangered Gila Chub and Gila Topminnow."
"Along Oak Creek, 19 separate ditches divert irrigation water to residents."
"Although the ditches are important contributors to the local economy, most are more than 150 years old and limited capital exists to invest in infrastructure upgrades to meet the needs of water users and aquatic habitat."
The Mason Lane Ditch provides water to over 220 acres of irrigated land along its five-mile path.
"Degradation throughout the canal resulted in leakage and seepage, threatening its ability to meet agricultural water needs."
"Erosion in one particular section of the canal formed several large leaks, spilling seven cubic feet of water per second from the ditch and reducing Oak Creeks flow by 15%."
"Meta provided support to Bonneville Environmental Foundation , which allowed for a partnership between The Nature Conservancy and the Mason Lane Water Users Association to install 5,280 feet of piping to reduce transmission losses and reduce the volume of water diverted from Oak Creek."
This project will restore over 180 million gallons of water to Oak Creek per year.
"In addition to projects that return volumes, we are investing in projects that have catalytic impacts on watersheds."
"In 2022, we will continue to support new water restoration projects in the watersheds where we operate, collaborate with other stakeholders in collective action to address shared water challenges, and invest in technologies to improve our water efficiency."

Stefanies hope is a world in which future generations can continue to enjoy the natural wonders in her home state and many others around the world.
How did your passion for water conservation and resource preservation lead you to Meta?
"My education focused on climate resilience, corporate sustainability and water."
"After grad school, I worked in the nonprofit sector developing guidance on corporate water stewardship and helping companies establish water stewardship programs as a consultant."
"My role with Meta gives me the opportunity to synthesize all of these experiences, and I am really excited about where our program is headed."
How can a company like Meta address environmental issues?
"We all have to do our part to ensure a safe, clean water supply."
"Private companies like Meta can work in collaboration with environmental nonprofits, utilities and the public sector to address shared water challenges on a broader scale."
Why is becoming water positive a priority for Meta?
"Water is an essential element in operating a tech company, and data centers can have a big water footprint."
"While we have some of the most water efficient data centers in the world, we also recognize that to be good water stewards, we need to collaborate with stakeholders beyond our own operations."
"Since 2017, we have partnered with environmental organizations and water utilities to restore water in the watersheds where we operate."
"In 2021, we announced our commitment to becoming water positive in 2030, and the program has since grown to 18 projects in six watersheds."
"How do you explain to your family and friends what you do at Meta, and what do they think?"
"At first, I got a lot of questions about how exactly a tech company uses water."
Now they understand and love hearing about the wide variety of water projects we supportfrom restoring wetlands to providing clean water to those without access to working with farmers or restoring landscapes with beaver dams.
Some of the most gratifying projects to me are the ones benefiting communities and ecosystems in my home state of Arizonaespecially those in the same creeks where I love to hike with friends and family.

BUILDING THE METAVERSE We are committed to building the metaverse sustainably.
"At Connect 2021 , our CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced Meta , which brings together our apps and technologies under one new company brand."
"The metaverse is an immersive, embodied successor to the mobile internet."
"Our focus will be to bring the metaverse to life, helping people connect, build communities, grow businesses and unlock new ways they can participate in the transition to a just, low-carbon economy."
"We are already developing exciting new technologies that will help people connect and explore in the metaverse, including our virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and wearable hardware technologies and devices."
"Our net zero commitment is inclusive of these products, and we are committed to building the metaverse sustainably."
"In 2021, we began conducting LCAs of our Reality Labs products, including Quest 2, to better understand the environmental impacts associated with each phase in the product life cyclematerials, transportation, use phase and end of life."
These LCAs enable teams to identify opportunities to incorporate circularity and reduce GHG emissions in our product development process.
Augmented reality uses a real-world setting while virtual reality is completely virtual.

Values are rounded and totals are calculated before rounding throughout this report.
2.
"Other data center-related facilities includes facilities where Meta used less than 100,000 MWh of electricity in the reporting year, such as warehouses or colocation facilities."
"Owned, online data centers are always reported by site, even if they were below this threshold."
3.
Metas methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions can be found here .
4.
"Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated annually based on the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol ."
5.
"(a) Scope 1 includes emissions from diesel, natural gas and refrigerants from offices and data centers and from diesel and gasoline in the transportation fleet owned and controlled by Meta."
"(b) Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity of offices and warehouses leased, controlled and owned by Meta; electricity of data centers owned and leased (IT load) by Meta; natural gas of offices and warehouses leased and serviced by Meta; and purchased heat."
"Because Meta does not control building operations in leased data center facilities, as of 2017, only emissions associated with its IT load electricity are included in Scope 2 emissions."
(c) Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions throughout Metas value chain.
"Starting in 2019, Meta included emissions from all relevant categories in Scope 3."
"Scope 3 emissions for 2015 to 2018 include business travel, employee commute and construction."
6.
"In the 2021 reporting year, two updates to reporting were applied to 2020 and later inventories: (a) Data from life cycle assessments for our hardware and sold products were used to calculate our Scope 3 emissions."
(b) 2020 use of sold product numbers were recalculated to improve accuracy.
7.
"Prior to 2020, Meta invested in avoided emissions offsets which are not considered carbon removal."
8.
"In the 2019 reporting year, three updates to reporting were applied to 2017 (baseline year) and later inventories: (a) Vehicles operated by the Transportation team in support of commuting and inter-campus travel were previously counted in Scope 3 Employee commute."
"After re-visiting Metas operational control of these vehicles, it was determined that they should be accounted for in Scope 1."
(b) It was determined that Meta overestimated natural gas emissions by including estimates for offices which do not in fact use natural gas.
Recalculations have been applied to the inventory to remove these inaccuracies.
(c) Fugitive emissions from refrigerant losses at offices not under Meta operational control were moved from Scope 2 to Scope 3.
9.
"In the 2020 reporting year, two emission factors updates significantly impacted the GHG inventory: (a) Economic-Environmental Input-Output emission factors were updated and applied to relevant categories."
2019 numbers were updated to reflect these new emission factors.
(b) Waste emission factors were updated and applied starting in 2020.
10.
"In the 2020 reporting year, two updates to the methodology were applied: (a) A new business travel methodology was developed, which was applied to 2019 and updated."
Air travel still includes radiative forcing starting from 2017.
"(b) Employee commuting now includes telecommuting, or work-from-home, emissions starting in 2020, for which the electricity portion is matched with renewable energy."
11.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel was purchased in 2021 and associated emissions reductions are reflected in the inventory.
12.
"This includes the following categories in Scope 3: downstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, upstream leased assets, and end-of-life treatment of sold products."
"Prior to 2020, emissions from use of sold products and upstream transportation and distribution are included in this category."
13.
"In owned and leased data center facilities included in Scope 2 and 3 emissions, Meta has matched building operations with renewable energy."
14.
"Power Use Effectiveness (PUE) and Water Use Effectiveness (WUE) is calculated based on best available data, including internal meters, design estimates and utility bills where applicable."
