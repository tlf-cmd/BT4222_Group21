"CEO LETTER OUR SUCCESS STARTS WITH OUR CULTURE Continues on next pageWhen I joined The Home Depot more than 22 years ago, I could never have imagined that I would have the opportunity to lead such an incredible organization."
"Prior to becoming CEO, I had the privilege to work in multiple departments across the organization."
One thing that has always been clear to me is that our values-driven culture and passion for our customers has been instrumental to our success.
"Built around our core values, our approach to ESG centers around three key pillars Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities."
"By identifying these three pillars, we can concentrate on the areas where we can have the greatest impact."
"Our 2022 ESG Report details the daily work we do to support these three pillars, as well as the progress we made in 2021 thanks to the dedication and ingenuity of our associates and suppliers."
"Our focus on people centers around continuously striving to create a work environment that is inclusive, engaging, and rewarding to associates."
Our associates outstanding performance in 2021 enabled 100% of our stores to qualify for Success Sharing bonus payments to non-management associates.
"We also offer training and development that transforms jobs into careers, which is reflected in the fact that approximately 90% of our U."
S. store leaders began as hourly associates.
Our U.
S. workforce is more ethnically diverse than the U.
S. working population.
"In addition, we increased the representation of female and underrepresented minority groups across our managers and above cohort in the U."
S. during 2021.
"CEO LetterBuilt around our core values, our approach to ESG centers around three key pillars Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities."
"By identifying these three pillars, we can concentrate on the areas where we can have the greatest impact."
"Ted Decker, CEO and president of The Home Depot We believe our associates should reflect the customers and communities we serve."
"In 2021, approximately 36% of our U."
"S. new hires were women, while more than 57% of U."
S. new hires were from an underrepresented minority group.
Our commitment to diversity also extends to our supplier relationships.
"In 2021, we increased our spend with diverse suppliers to $3.3 billion and have announced a goal to achieve $5 billion in direct annual spend with diverse suppliers by 2025."
We also completed our goal to launch a Tier II supplier diversity program to encourage our suppliers to spend with diverse businesses.
"We will continue to push forward in this area by partnering with organizations like the Billion Dollar Roundtable, an association geared at celebrating corporations that spend at least $1 billion per year with minority- and woman-owned suppliers, to further amplify our supplier diversity efforts."
Our efforts to operate sustainably begin with our understanding that our biggest impact on the environment comes from the products we sell.
"Our partnership with suppliers allows us to give our customers access to hundreds of products that are good for their homes, good for the environment, and good for their wallets."
"In 2021, we estimate our customers purchases of Energy Star products helped reduce annual electricity use by 7 billion kilowatt hours, saving $950 million on energy costs, and lowering carbon emissions by 4.9 million metric tons."
Our water-saving products allowed customers to reduce consumption by over 66 billion gallons.

"Ted Decker, CEO and president of The Home DepotWe also made progress in 2021 by operating more sustainably in our own business, reducing electricity consumption in our U."
S. stores by approximately 11% year-over-year.
We cut U.
S. store electricity usage a remarkable 50% since 2010.
A hallmark of progress in this area has been the transition to LED overhead lighting in our U.
"S. stores, which join our Canada and Mexico stores in having nearly all of interior lighting powered by LED bulbs."
"While we remain focused on reducing our energy consumption, we are also making progress towards our goal of producing or procuring 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by 2030."
We focus on strengthening our communities by giving back financially and through our associates time and efforts dedicated to Team Depot volunteer activities a hallmark of who we are.
"In 2021, approximately 14,000 associates volunteered in communities across 150 cities nationwide."
"Our Team Depot volunteers helped our communities prepare and respond to natural disasters like tornados, hurricanes, and wildfires, while also achieving more than 1.25 million hours of service to veterans since 2011."
We also value our nonprofit partners that enable The Home Depot Foundation to improve the homes and lives of U.
"S. veterans, train skilled tradespeople to fill the labor gap, and support communities affected by natural disasters."
"In 2021, the Foundation achieved a milestone of ten years and over $400 million invested in support of veteran causes, on track to contribute half of a billion dollars to veteran causes by 2025."
"While we have made significant progress, there is more work to do."
"On Pages 9 and 10 of this report, you will see the goals weve set as we strive to build a better and more sustainable business."
"We know that when we invest in running a responsible, sustainable company, we make our business stronger, more agile, and more resilient."
"2021 was another year filled with great accomplishments, and I want to thank our associates and supplier partners for the many ways they enable us to do our part and live our values every day.5 The Home Depot 2022 ESG Report OverviewStrengthen Our CommunitiesFocus on Our PeopleOur BusinessOperate SustainablyReporting FrameworkTable of ContentsInternational Retail Operations ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS & SETTING PRIORITIES As the largest home improvement retailer in the world, we have the unique opportunity to create positive impacts across a broad number of stakeholders."
"We have also been reminded over the last two years how quickly our world can change, which is why we continue our practice of proactive engagement and provide numerous channels for feedback, so we can remain attentive to the concerns and needs of our stakeholders."
"We have learned over the years that one of the best ways for us to make sure we understand the relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts of our business and the current areas of focus of our many stakeholders is to engage with our stakeholders."
This engagement comes through multiple channels.
We receive constant feedback from our customers through the more than a billion and a half transactions across our stores and digital channels annually.
"We survey our approximately 500,000 associates to measure how emotionally connected they are to their work."
We collaborate with our vendors and suppliers in an effort to lessen the environmental impact of the products we sell.
Individuals and organizations from around the globe reach out to us with questions or concerns about our operations or products.
We meet with shareholders and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) interested in our business practices.
We take part in industry efforts to raise awareness about the ESG responsibilities we all share.
"Our ongoing interactions may be formal or informal, as detailed in our ESG Priority Assessment Framework on Page 7."
"These interactions help validate our own priority assessment; they also help us gauge the impact of our business, refine ESG priorities, measure our progress and design ways to improve."

"Our Sustainability Council, composed of representatives from different areas of the business, oversees our approach to sustainability."
Members of the Council share stakeholder feedback from their functional areas.
"The Council focuses on several key areas, as shown below."
"The Council meets twice a year, and its chair presents our sustainability strategy and activities to the Board of Directors annually."
We also provide quarterly updates to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regarding our ESG engagement.
"Our ESG priorities and plans are communicated internally and externally via various channels, including in this annual report."

Ratings & Recognition15 The Home Depot 2022 ESG Report OverviewStrengthen Our CommunitiesFocus on Our PeopleOur BusinessOperate SustainablyReporting FrameworkTable of ContentsInternational Retail Operations Home Depots chief sustainability officer Ron Jarvis has spent more than two decades driving sustainability improvements at The Home Depot.
Here he offers insights into our progress.
FAQ: WE ALL OWN SUSTAINABILITY Who drives ESG at The Home Depot?
How is The Home Depot helping customers increase the sustainability of their homes and businesses?
Is sustainability a competitive advantage for The Home Depot?
How have associates helped drive ESG progress at The Home Depot?
Many associates and business leaders throughout our enterprise!
They take pride in improving their departments and businesses in multiple ESG aspects.
"Our leadership understands that an effective environmental, social and governance strategy cannot happen in isolation."
It is not the sole responsibility of a corporate ESG team.
"Rather, our ESG strategy must reflect The Home Depots core values, and it must be embedded in all aspects of how we run our business."
Everybody owns it.
"Our Eco Actions program, which builds on our original Eco Options program that we launched in 2007, helps our customers take on more sustainable DIY projects and choose greener products that can save water, conserve energy or are formulated to reduce certain chemicals."
Products can only qualify for this distinction if manufacturers provide third-party verification of environmental claims that meet our programs requirements.
"This program also offers customers green project ideas and tips, for example, how to grow an organic garden (see Page 50)."
"In addition, we encourage our customers to drop off used compact fluorescent light bulbs and rechargeable batteries for recycling."
"In 2021, we collected 1,162,800 pounds of recycled batteries, a 24% increase since 2014 (see Page 54)."
We also help our customers go greener in ways that may be less apparent to them.
"For example, we offer circularity-centered products like our Home Depot-branded moving boxes, made from 100% post- consumer recycled paper fiber (see Page 45), as well as composite deck boards made from recycled plastic waste from our stores."
We continue to make progress on our goal to exclude expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film from our private-brand product packaging by the end of 2023.
"When customers rent tools from us, they help avoid the environmental impact of new product manufacturing."
"Another example: Our stores have cut electricity consumption 50% since 2010, providing our customers a lower energy intensive shopping environment."
"Overall, we believe good business decisions drive sustainability."
Examples of this can be seen through the investments weve made to create the most efficient supply chain in home improvement.
"These investments have helped us reduce the number of trucks needed and distance traveled to get our products from our supplier to our customers, while also reducing fuel emissions."
"Another example of this is our store investments, part of which included transitioning stores to LED lighting, which helped us reduce operating costs and electricity consumption."
"We also believe that by working with our suppliers to bring innovative and sustainable products to market, we help our customers create more sustainable homes and workplaces."
"Our efforts to drive innovation can be seen in every aisle of the store, and we believe this is a key differentiator in the market."
We also want to see sustainability be the norm for our entire industry.
"We are encouraged when we see other retailers take big swings and do innovative things that push all of us to do a better job of protecting the planet, and we hope the innovation that we bring through our operations and products motivates others to do the same."
"One of our eight core values is Do The Right Thing, which drives our associates to find new ways that our organization can reduce its environmental impact."
This can be seen through our packaging team who looks for ways to reduce the package footprints and ways to use more sustainable materials for our private-label products (see Page 55).
Another example are our associates who work to find ways to upcycle the packaging waste in our stores and supply chain into new products like Trex composite decking.

FOCUSING ON THOSE WHO SERVESPOTLIGHT Honoring those who serve or who have served us is fundamental to our ESG pillar of Strengthening our Communities.
Our focus on the military community and their families includes the tens of thousands of veterans and military spouses in our workforce.
"Through our recently expanded Military Relations department, we look for ways to make The Home Depot an employer of choice for military members, veterans and their families."
"One of those veterans is Pete Capel, who has created a 30+ year career with The Home Depot."
"Like his father who served in the Navy during WWII, Pete joined the Marine Corps in 1983."
"During his 7-year military career maintaining radar systems, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant and was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal twice, an award that recognizes outstanding achievement or meritorious service and is recognized across all military branches."
"After Pete left the Marine Corps in 1990, he began to think about what was next in his life."
Thats when his story with The Home Depot started in the most unlikely of ways.
"Pete was getting his hair cut when Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, Home Depot co-founders, appeared on TV."
"As they were talking about how the company got started, Pete looked up and saw that there was a Home Depot store across the street."
"After his appointment ended, Pete walked over and immediately applied for a job."
Pete was originally employed as a store sales associate in the electrical department.
"Since then, hes held positions of increasing responsibility over his 30-year career."
"Today, hes the vice president of field merchandising for the northern, southern, and western divisions."
"Just as Pete did more than 30 years ago, Richard Cranford and Aminah Meho recently left careers in the Army and Air Force, respectively, and found new opportunities with The Home Depot."

#OrangeAtHeart 32 The Home Depot 2022 ESG Report OverviewStrengthen Our CommunitiesFocus on Our PeopleOur BusinessReporting FrameworkTable of ContentsInternational Retail OperationsOperate Sustainably ASSOCIATE SAFETY The Home Depot strives to provide the safest working and shopping environment for our associates and customers.
A major component in the strategy is raising awareness of risks among both front-line associates and leaders.
"When our people are trained to recognize and correct hazards, our workplace is primed for continual improvement."
Safety Takes EveryONE In 2021 we launched an awareness campaign called Safety Takes EveryONE.
"This message exemplifies that everyone, at all levels of the organization, must contribute to the safety of our associates and customers."
"At the individual level of the campaign, each associate is provided tools to avoid risk, with every decision made, resulting in everyday safety."
Safety Takes EveryONE is our rally cry to remind associates that safety is their most important responsibility and allows us to send everyone home safely.
The leader approach to Safety Takes EveryONE utilizes the acronym ONE.
This second arm of the campaign focuses of our leaders efforts to increase awareness of the higher-risk injury categories.
"The O is for Overexertion Whether associates are handling product in a distribution center, receiving freight in a store, helping a customer load product into their vehicle or delivering bulky product to a jobsite, lifting too much or too frequently can result in injury."
"To prevent these injuries, we ask our leaders to engage with associates to create sustainable habits centered on our Lift it Close to Home ergonomic program."
"This program reminds individuals to minimize strain on their shoulders and back by anchoring the product lifted to their aprons Home Depot logo, promoting safer lifting techniques."
The N is for New Hire Our focus is to ensure our newest associates are set up for safety success.
"Starting with their initial onboarding, we have simplified and prioritized safety training earlier in an associates experience to raise awareness around the riskiest tasks."
We reinforce our onboarding program with monthly awareness topics and leader-driven engagements during the first six months of employment to allow associates to ask questions and provide feedback to improve safety.
Safety Takes EveryONE requires leaders to engage with their associates early in their career to establish a positive safety culture.
The E is for Equipment Equipment is essential to all areas of our business and it is paramount that it is operated in a safe manner.
Safety Takes EveryONE requires leaders to interact with associates through safety engagements focusing on the safe operations of both the driver and the associates working around the equipment.
The results of these engagements are reviewed and shared with leaders to create a continuous improvement model.
This heightened awareness drives innovation that will remove risk from our business and improve the safety within our stores and facilities.
"Safety is not one persons responsibility, Safety Takes EveryONE to create an environment that fosters feedback, empowers our associates and leaders to make the safest decision, and allows every associate and customer to go home safely to their loved ones every day."
Our people are our most important assets.
"By focusing on workplace safety training and risk reduction, we help keep our associates and customers injury-free."

We participate in the CDP reporting process.
"CDP , formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, is an independent, international, nonprofit organization that provides a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share environmental information."
"Our latest score of A- from CDP reflects our leadership and high level of action on climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency."

"But by tapping into technologies and closely tracking and analyzing use, we were able to save more electricity than we originally imagined."
(See chart.)
"In 2021 alone, we reduced year-over-year U."
S. store electricity use approximately 11%.
"We learned a great deal from the progress we made reducing electricity use in our stores, and now we are applying our experience and proven strategies to conserving resources in other areas of our business, including electricity use in our supply chain and water use in store irrigation."
Our successful energy conservation efforts have helped us move closer to our goal of producing or procuring 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by 2030.
"LEDs Help Reduce Store Electricity Usage In 2021, we completed our multi-year project to upgrade U."

"In 2021, Enel Green Powers Azure Sky began operating in Haskell County, Texas, west of Dallas, providing us with 75 megawatts of renewable electricity."
We have agreed to purchase another 150 megawatts from companies building solar farms elsewhere in Texas.
"Once operating, we expect these commercial solar farms, in addition to our wind farm projects, to provide us with enough electricity to power the equivalent of more than 500 Home Depot stores."

"Due to our supply chain investments, however, we have demonstrated our ability to navigate any environment."
"In addition, our supply chain investments have helped us move record amounts of product more efficiently."
"Despite seeing another year of record product volume move through our business, our new supply chain facilities helped us reduce the miles driven to get products from our vendors to our customers."
"Even as supply chain volume increased, the efficiencies we gained in our operations and our investments in green energy helped us reduce our carbon intensity."

"We sell available space on our trucks and buy space from other companies, ensuring fewer underloaded trailers hit the road."
That space sharing saves about 2 million driven miles a year.
"By partnering with suppliers to forgo pallets, we can stack products to the top of trailers, resulting in a reduction in the number of truckloads needed to transport some goods."
"WAYS WERE DRIVING SUPPLY CHAIN IMPROVEMENTS In 2021, we installed hydrogen fuel cells at three U."
"S. supply chain facilities, giving us 15 locations with emissions-free fuel for forklifts."
We estimate these fuel cells helped us reduce electricity consumption by about 21 million kilowatt hours in 2021.

We report on our progress in an annual Responsible Sourcing Report.
"Our Responsible Sourcing Standards mandate that suppliers and factories abide by all applicable international and local laws, rules and regulations in the manufacturing and distribution of merchandise or services provided to us."
We conduct audits of factories around the world to ensure compliance with our responsible sourcing standards.
Suppliers must maintain on-site documentation that demonstrates compliance with our responsible sourcing standards.
"They also must allow Home Depot associates and/or representatives full access to production facilities, worker records, production records and workers for confidential interviews in connection with monitoring visits."
"We expect our suppliers to promptly correct any noncompliance, starting with timely preparation and presentation of a corrective and preventative action plan."
"We also re-audit supplier facilities, with the frequency depending on their performance in prior audits."
"If suppliers fail to improve, we may terminate our business relationships with them."
"Equally important, we support factories that take action to create lasting social and environmental compliance programs."

The goal of our sustainable forestry efforts is to ensure timber and healthy forests remain available for future generations.
We are proud of our ability to create positive change by encouraging sustainable forestry practices.
"We strive to better understand the social and economic effects that wood purchases have around the world, especially in regions with endangered forests."
"Over the years, we have focused our efforts to ensure the protection of forests at highest risk."
"While we sell less than 2% of the roundwood cut worldwide, we believe our efforts have had an outsized impact on the industry."
"We source approximately 86% from North America, approximately 8% from South America, approximately 3% from Asia, and less than 1% from each of Europe, Africa, and Oceania."
"We believe that through our ongoing work with suppliers to sustainably manage forests and the commitments listed in our Wood Purchasing Policy, we have helped to expand forest land coverage in North America."
"Through the sharing of best practices with suppliers and ongoing engagement with stakeholders, we seek to build upon the progress weve made to protect the worlds forests."
The positive impact of our work with suppliers can be seen in our results.
"We also source lumber from a number of the largest forestry companies in North America, which work with sustainable forest management organizations like Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), and American Tree Farm to ensure their trees are being sourced sustainably."
"Suppliers of ours like Mendocino Redwood Company (MRC ) and Humboldt Redwood Company (HRC) seek to be examples of forest restoration and show how private forest management can protect and restore the ecological attributes of the forest, and whose forestlands are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) as being well-managed forests."

"The Board oversees risk through this framework, with oversight accomplished by identifying key risks and mapping them to the appropriate Board Committee or to the full Board."
"Our Board reviews these key risks and the related framework annually, and the full Board or appropriate Board committees discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year, including the COVID-19 pandemic, its related risks and its impact on our enterprise risk framework."

Our Political Activity and Government Relations Policy provides the framework for our political activity.
"We engage in three key ways: Our Government Relations department protects and expands our companys ability to take care of our associates, customers and shareholders through effective regulatory and legislative action."
"Our Government Relations team works to optimize the governments impact on the business through effective lobbying, relationship building and political engagement."
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS We have a political action committee (PAC) that connects our salaried associates to the political process and pools their personal contributions to financially support pro-business candidates who understand issues of importance to The Home Depot and our associates.
"As a long-standing practice, we do not contribute to presidential campaigns or endorse presidential candidates."
"The Home Depot recognizes that laws at the federal, state and local level impact our business."
Government Relations The Home Depot supports trade associations that advocate on behalf of the business community and retail sector and reports annually the aggregate dues paid to those associations that engage in lobbying activities.
"For the first time, The Home Depot has created an Economic Impact interactive map that highlights the importance of its business in communities around the country."
"The Economic Impact map, which was created in collaboration in collaboration between our Government Relations, Tax and Strategic Business Development teams, along with PwC, includes information about employment numbers, taxes, community involvement, and donations of critical COVID-19 supplies."
The map gives a state-by-state breakdown so customers and associates can easily see the impact in their communities.
"CHECK IT OUTIn deciding where we want to focus our advocacy, these are some of our top priorities: Driving sales by ensuring online-only marketplaces follow the same rules on accountability and transparency as interconnected retailers Supporting our Supply Chain initiative by advocating for funding for roads, ports and bridges and for laws that allow safer, heavier trucks to reduce loads and our environmental footprint Growing margin dollars by working to get laws passed that target sophisticated, organized retail crime rings to reduce theft and support free trade Taking care of our people by making sure we have a say in laws that could affect associate flexibility and career growth79 The Home Depot 2022 ESG Report OverviewStrengthen Our CommunitiesFocus on Our PeopleOur BusinessReporting FrameworkTable of ContentsInternational Retail OperationsOperate Sustainably Oversight of Our Political Activity Our Government Relations department, led by a vice president who reports to our general counsel, manages our political activity."
"The team carefully analyzes our engagement activities, trade association partnerships, and political contributions for alignment with our key priorities, guided by our Core Values."
All of The Home Depots political contributions are made to promote the interests of the company and without regard for the private political preferences of executives or directors.
The Government Relations team is responsible for ensuring all PAC and corporate political contributions are made in accordance with the law and company policies.
The team participates in regular trainings and performs routine reviews to monitor compliance.
"The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors provides additional oversight, conducting an annual review of our Political Activity and Government Relations Policy, the companys political contributions and payments to trade associations that engage in lobbying activities."
The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee must approve in advance any public advertisement directly or indirectly paid for by the Company that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate in which Home Depot is identified specifically as an advocate of such election or defeat.
"To date, the company has not made any expenditure for such electioneering communications, and has no present plans to make any such expenditures."
"The Home Depot PACs finances, governance and communications are governed by a PAC Board."
The PAC Board is chaired by the vice president of Government Relations and is made up of representatives from each functional area of the business and each field division to ensure a wide range of experiences and perspectives.
"We provide transparency in our actions by publishing an annual report of the companys political contributions and the aggregate dues paid to trade associations that engage in lobbying activities, and any independent political expenditures by the Company supporting or opposing ballot initiatives and contributions to ballot measures committees."
"We list trade associations to which our company makes yearly payments of $5,000 or more, and our PAC contributions are publicly available on the Federal Election Commission website."
