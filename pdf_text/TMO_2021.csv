Corporate governance We believe strong corporate governance is important to ensure that Thermo Fisher is managed for the long-term benefit of our shareholders and other stakeholders.

Our current goal is for 30% of our Board to be gender diverse by our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders.

"For years, there has been a demonstrated industry, scientific, regulatory and societal need to increase the inclusion of historically underrepresented patient populations in clinical trials."
This is critical to ensuring medicines are tested in populations that will ultimately use them.
It also broadens access to innovative investigational therapies for patients within specific therapeutic or disease areas.
Our clinical research business has focused on helping customers meet expanding and changing regulatory requirements.
"This includes engaging representative, diverse demographic sub-groups in their clinical research studies through innovative patient-focused strategies."
"At a critical point during Modernas COVID-19 vaccine trials, we took steps to partner with them and create a more balanced participant base."
"Moderna chose to slow its enrollment timeline to ensure appropriate inclusion of diverse communities that, early in the pandemic, were found to be disproportionately impacted by COVID-19."
"Through our targeted and inclusive recruitment efforts at this stage, 45% of the participants we added to the study were from underrepresented groups, whereas the industry average for diversity inclusion in clinical trials is 25%.4 Cultivating diversity in clinical trials Thanks to the Moderna and PPD clinical research team, we were able to obtain a more inclusive diverse patient population for our trial."

"Thermo Fisher has established an EHS operation model that consists of a network of EHS professionals at the corporate, regional and site levels who work together to ensure compliance and drive continuous improvement."
"This group of EHS subject matter experts spans a complex global regulatory environment, creating value for the organization by ensuring the implementation of our EHS Policy."
Our PPI Business System combined with our proactive approach to site safety has helped decrease our lost-time injury rate (LTIR) and total recordable injury rate (TRIR) in recent years.
"Our downward incident trends can be attributed to our strong safety culture and safety commitments at Corporate EHS Compliance Audit Program Our Corporate EHS Compliance Audit Program, which operates independently of individual business unit control, conducts periodic, objective and evidence- based evaluations of our locations EHS compliance status."
"Our auditors evaluate site operations for compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and other related standards we may adopt and endorse."
This corporate-level audit function is in addition to requiring all applicable locations to implement and periodically verify their conformance to our EHS-MS Policy and conduct internal EHS compliance audits.
This provides a dual-layer oversight system to objectively assess EHS risk at a site level.
We also invoke a process for independent corporate corrective and preventive action to systematically drive closure of all outstanding EHS audit findings in a timely manner.
Our auditors work with each site to review closure evidence before formally closing out findings.
"In addition to our internal EHS audit process, all of our major operating sites go through regular external property/loss prevention audits."
"Our facilities undergo onsite audits to assess business resilience against the risks of fire and destruction caused by natural catastrophes such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, earthquakes and tornados."
A sites audit data is every level of the organization.

"In 2021, we announced our commitment to becoming net-zero by 2050 and joined the Business Ambition for 1.5C campaign led by the Science Based Targets initiative."
"This aligns our climate strategy and goals with the Paris Agreement, expanding on our existing 2030 target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% compared to 2018."
"To round out our approach, we also established a near-term target for our indirect Scope 3 emissions."
"Investing in a high-impact plan Making 2021 even more transformative, we enhanced strategic investments in staffing, reevaluating and resourcing our climate program to support the design and implementation of our net-zero roadmap."
"As this roadmap continues to develop, we are supporting a strategic mix of emissions reduction actions that will deliver a positive impact at scale."
"The key components of our framework include: Energy & emissions Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions In 2021, we achieved a 12% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions compared to our 2018 baseline."
This progress places us ahead of schedule toward our 2030 target despite the considerable expansion of our global capacity and infrastructure throughout 2020 and 2021.
"Over the past year of operational growth alone, our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon intensity equalled 16 metric tons of carbon dioxide per million USD in revenue, down from 19 in 2020 and 27 prior to the pandemic."
Increased procurement of renewable electricity was the primary driver of these reductions.
See the Data summary for a complete list of indicators.
"In 2021, we completed energy assessments at our largest manufacturing facilities that represent 40% of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 footprint."
"The findings uncovered opportunities to eliminate over 80,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, approximately 25% of our fossil fuel- related emissions."
"Over the coming year, several of these projects will be implemented and additional site energy assessments completed to plan our Transitioning away from fossil fuels and high- impact refrigerants in our operationsEngaging with our suppliers to amplify collective progressSourcing renewable electricity across our operations transition away from fossil fuels."
Renewable electricity procurement is critical to our near-term strategy.
"We achieved a new record in 2021, with 22% of global electricity coming from renewable sources, a 69% increase over the prior year."
More than 60 Thermo Fisher sites have now achieved 100% renewable electricity.
Our approach is centered around the concept of additionalityor directly supporting the development of new renewable generation sources.

"Best explained by site leader Omar Castillo, [Operating without fossil fuels] is a result of many steps we took over a period of several years."
"Over the last decade, Omar and his team examined where they could leverage opportunities to make the facility more energy efficient and environmentally friendly."
"To eliminate fossil fuels entirely, they used several readily available technologies to achieve their goal, including geothermal heating and cooling, heat recovery and a rooftop solar system."
"Last year the electricity supply was transitioned to 100% renewables, meaning the facility now generates zero greenhouse gas emissions."
"For Thermo Fisher, this achievement demonstrates that operating without fossil fuels is possible in a manufacturing setting."
The work completed by the Germering team has been shared with other facilities across the globe to further accelerate the Companys plans to achieve net-zero.
The Germering team has already set their sights on another goal.
"The next steps involve making our products and logistics more environmentally sustainable, said Omar."
"This includes, for example, procurement of environmentally preferable parts for manufacturing, energy-efficient product transportation and recyclable products."
"Customers not only want excellent products and service, they also want assurance that we, as their partner and supplier, are doing all we can to operate in an environmentally responsible manner."
"Achieving our first fossil fuel- free facilityFeature storyScope 3 emissions Our supply chain is our largest source of emissions, representing more than 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions generated within our value chain."
"With the development of a supplier engagement program for climate change, we can greatly reduce our environmental impact as a Company and sector."
"In 2021, we took on a robust body of work to calculate the baseline for our Scope 3 emissions."
"To encourage a similar investment in reporting and emissions reduction, we have established our first near-term Scope 3 target."
"For suppliers that represent 90% of our Scope 3 emissions from (1) Purchased Goods and Services and (2) Upstream Transportation and Distribution, Thermo Fisher will engage them in setting climate-related, science-based targets by 2027."
