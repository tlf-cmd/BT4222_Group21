"Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022 Vision and strategy: A letter from our chairman, PRESIDENT AND CEO To all our stakeholders: It is the honor of my professional life to lead the best team in our industry at NextEra Energy."
Our team has a clear vision: We will help lead the decarbonization of the U.
S. economy.
This vision is bold even unprecedented.
"Yet, its consistent with our decades-long record of performance for all our stakeholders, including our accomplishments and goals related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) that we share with you in this report."
"I joined this company nearly 20 years ago, and right away was given the opportunity to work on a game-changing step we took at that time to move forward to a clean energy future."
"That transaction was the conversion of a gas turbine contract with General Electric, still one of our largest suppliers today, to a contract for wind turbines."
"We made that decision because we saw something others didnt see, that renewables would soon become the low-cost generation source of choice."
Our first-mover advantage in wind at what is now NextEra Energy Resources was soon expanded to solar.
"We started first with solar-thermal technology, but then photovoltaic technology came along and was a game-changer for us and for our entire economy, and our solar business began to take off."
"Over the years, NextEra Energy Resources became the largest generator of wind and solar energy in the world."
"Over this same period, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) led its own transformation."
FPL was already one of the best utilities in the nation.
"But the FPL team was not satisfied 20 years ago, and still is not satisfied today, and we have chosen to be a first mover in the utility space time and time again."
FPL voluntarily reduced our reliance on foreign oil by 99% starting in 2001.
We were also one of the very first utilities to fully deploy smart meters across our service area and to launch a comprehensive storm hardening program to help us restore power faster after major storms and to help us improve everyday reliability.
And FPL was also the first utility to really go after renewables as a way to reduce customer bills relative to alternatives.
"3 We plan to decarbonize ourselves, starting at FPL, with the most ambitious goal set by any U."
"S. utility or power provider to date, and the sectors only one to not require carbon offsets."

"Several years ago, both businesses invested in battery storage, which is the holy grail of renewables because it can help make wind and solar energy a nearly firm energy product."
"Today, our vision is focused on deploying even more renewables and storage, which in the future we expect to be supplemented by green hydrogen as a way to convert gas turbines to generate emissions-free baseload generation."
"We have built both FPL and NextEra Energy Resources through a series of toe-in-the-water investments that over time have added up to something big, a scalable platform, built from the ground up, and centered on the best opportunity set and team in the industry."
Our vision to help decarbonize the U.
S. economy is based upon that scalable platform and everything else that has made our company successful over at least the last 20 years.

"Many other elements of our ESG strategy are discussed throughout this report, such as the measurable progress we have made on racial equity at our company, especially over the last two years."
"We have also committed to additional disclosures on various metrics related to diversity, equity and inclusion."
I am proud of our teams efforts and am honored to have joined a board of directors that has such a strong commitment to corporate governance and ethics and which provides oversight of every facet of NextEra Energys strategy that is reflected in this document.
Our company has made many ambitious goals.
"Some, such as reliable and affordable electric service, date from the founding of our company nearly a century ago."
"Others, such as our new Real Zero goal, keep us focused on what we can achieve in the decades ahead."
Reaching each of our goals is the imperative of the most talented team in our industry.
"Over the last 20 years, and especially over the last six months, I have become even more grateful for all my colleagues who come to work every day focused on delivering even more value to our customers and who challenge themselves to make our company even better."

"These results demonstrate that, even with dramatic growth in our core business, weve reduced our already industry-leading, carbon-emissions rate much faster than the industry average leading the way to Real Zero, we believe."
"Strategy Climate-related risks and opportunities influence our strategy across all of our businesses over the short term (less than five years), medium term (five to 10 years) and long term (greater than 10 years)."
"As we respond to our customers demands for emissions-free and renewable energy, climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced our financial plan for capital expenditures, acquisitions and revenues."
"Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022 The Cotton Creek Solar Energy Center was commissioned in Northwest Florida in March 2022.Customer demands also have influenced our capital plan in executing our significant renewable energy deployment and transmission line development business plans, including our grid hardening initiatives."
"At FPL, climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced our operational strategy, including our short- and medium-term strategy for daily operations and infrastructure planning in our integrated resource plan."
"This strategy is reflected in our modernization of FPLs generation fleet by first replacing old, inefficient oil, natural gas and coal plants with state-of-the-art natural gas units."
"We reduced our use of oil to generate electricity from 41 million barrels in 2001, the most in the country, to only 100,000 barrels of low-sulphur diesel, a fuel used as emergency backup, in 2021."
"In 2020, we converted the Gulf Clean Energy Center, formerly Plant Crist, to natural gas, cutting its CO 2-emissions rate by 40%."
"With the 2020 retirement of FPLs Indiantown Cogeneration facility, 2021 was the first time in nearly 70 years that there were no coal-fired power plants in our Florida system."
"The phase-out of these coal facilities is expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of savings for customers, while eliminating millions of tons of CO 2 emissions annually."
"The next leg of FPLs generation modernization efforts is focused on deploying solar, which is now the most cost-effective generation resource in most parts of our service area."
"At the end of 2021, FPL had approximately 3,164 MW of solar generation capacity on its system, making it the largest producer of solar energy-generated electricity in Florida."
"By the end of 2031, FPL projects that it will have approximately 12,626 MW of photovoltaic (PV) solar generation."
"Company projections show that the cleanest energy sources, such as low-emissions natural gas, zero-carbon-emissions nuclear and solar, will provide approximately 99% of all energy produced in FPLs system in 2031, putting the company well on its way to attaining Real Zero."
Our decarbonization goals also includes converting current natural gas generation to green hydrogen or renewable natural gas in the future.
"NextEra Energy has built and operates more solar power facilities than any other utility in the nation, and we have even more on the way as we work to reach our Real Zero goal and continue to build a more resilient and sustainable energy future."
We believe all forms of solar play a role in a zero-carbon-emissions future and we support customers who choose to put solar panels on their roofs.
"In Florida, we are concerned about the growing and unnecessary state-mandated, subsidized bill credit for the very small fraction of customers who choose to buy or lease expensive rooftop solar systems, yet the credit is funded by all FPL customers, including those who cant or choose not to place solar systems on their homes."

"NextEra Energy Resources, our diversified, clean energy business, emphasizes the development, construction and operation of long-term contracted assets."
"We continue to tailor solutions for commercial, utility and public power customers who want to access their own clean, reliable, renewable energy."
We offer a combination of energy solutions that cannot be found elsewhere in the marketplace from one company.
"These solutions include universal and small-scale solar energy, wind energy and energy storage behind and in front of the meter."
"Our focus at NextEra Energy Resources is to develop long-term contracted, low-cost wind and solar generation assets, increasingly paired with battery energy storage."
We have been in the renewable development business for decades.
"From these early beginnings, we have become the worlds largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and the sun and a world leader in battery energy storage."
"Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022 An example is the Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility, which went online in March 2022."
"This innovative project combines wind, solar and battery energy storage technology in one location."
The wind component encompasses up to 300 MW of wind capacity produced by approximately 120 wind turbines.
"Along with the broader public shift toward calls for action to fight climate change, over the past few years there has been an increased focus on sustainability on the part of many of our stakeholders."
"While we expect this trend to amplify demand among our traditional customers and in our core renewable energy business, we also believe that it is opening significant new markets and business opportunities for NextEra Energy Resources."
"With NextEra Energys leadership and Real Zero goal, NextEra Energy Resources plans to help customers achieve their emissions-reduction goals and eventually attain Real Zero themselves."
"We anticipate our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new, non-traditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector, as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure energy from clean generation sources."

The operation combines solar with wind and battery storage.
"Climate change risk typeApplication to our businesses Current/emerging regulationOur operations are subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulations."
Current and emerging regulations are addressed in risk management and business planning.
"As an example, under a Florida law enacted in 2019, FPL must file a long-term Storm Protection Plan that details how it plans to continue to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient grid in the years ahead."
The Storm Protection Plan and subsequent Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) rules regarding cost recovery mechanism are examples of current regulation that address risks related to climate change and severe weather events and impact how FPL receives cost recovery for its storm hardening activities.
Technology Technology developments are reviewed as part of our corporate risk assessment and strategic planning processes.
We are always focused on innovation and exploring new technologies.
Being innovative and having a strong commitment to continuous improvement is at the heart of who we are as a company.
"From state-of-the-art renewable energy solutions and leading-edge battery storage systems to smart grid technology and drones equipped with artificial intelligence, were making significant investments in innovative, advanced technologies to do whats right on behalf of our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders."
Transition risks related to changes in the price and availability of technology are some of the risks related to climate change that we consider in our analyses.
"Based on our ongoing analysis of the long-term potential of low-cost renewables, we remain confident that wind, solar and battery storage will help reduce costs for customers and help achieve future CO 2-emissions reductions on our path to Real Zero by no later than 2045."
Legal While FPLs generation portfolio emits greenhouse gases at a lower rate than most of the U.
"S. electric generation sector, its results of operations could be impacted to the extent that new federal or state laws or regulations impose any new greenhouse gas emissions limits or a price on CO 2 emissions."
"To address this potential risk, FPLs integrated resource planning and annual Ten-Year Site Plan filing with the FPSC have included CO 2 cost projections since 2007."
"On the other hand, we believe that any such new laws or regulations likely would increase the demand for NextEra Energy Resources clean energy products and services."
Market Investments by FPL are guided by a well-established integrated resource planning process to determine the amount and timing of future generation needed to meet projected growth in energy load and demand.
"Market climate-related risks are incorporated into this planning process and different options are evaluated taking into account system economics, forecasted electric power demand, demand-side management, fuel prices, potential future climate policies and the integration of low-cost, clean and reliable generation, including solar and energy storage solutions."
We also look at the impact of federal and state energy efficiency codes and standards.
"To the extent market forces drive demand for renewable energy, we believe that should only increase the opportunities available for NextEra Energy Resources."
Acute/chronic physical Physical risks tied to climate change are reviewed as part of our risk management process.
"Changes in global climate could produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, particularly relevant to FPL, changes in sea level."
"FPL operates in the east and lower west coasts of Florida and in Northwest Florida, areas that historically have been prone to severe weather events, such as hurricanes."
"Throughout our history of managing the impacts of hurricanes and natural disasters in Florida, we have remained focused on safety, execution and the importance of providing an essential service to our customers during these events."
"Our continued investments and preparation at FPL have resulted in building a stronger, smarter and more resilient energy grid that has improved reliability in good weather and bad and enables faster power restoration following extreme weather events."
"Since 2006, FPL has made significant investments in strengthening the energy grid to make it more resilient to severe weather."
The deployment of innovative technology to help prevent outages and shorten restoration times when outages occur has enabled FPL to lower operating costs and improve reliability and resiliency.

"Preparedness, crisis planning and risk management are part of our culture."
"Our president and CEO, who also serves as our chief risk officer, and executive management are responsible for executing our long-term strategy, while also monitoring climate-change opportunities and risks related to our strategy."
Our corporate risk management committee provides oversight and support for our risk management activities.
"For the purposes of our risk management process, we do not view climate change as a discrete risk, but rather a potential stress multiplier to existing risks and opportunities that we monitor very closely and have worked to mitigate for a very long time."
"For example, system disruption from a weather event is a long-standing risk that we have integrated into our risk assessment process, and potential climate change projections for more frequent storms would be a multiplier for this risk category but not necessarily broken out as an incremental impact being added separately."
We also recognize that climate change may affect different parts of our business in different ways.
Metrics and targets The business metrics we use to assess climate-related risks and opportunities include our progress against each business units goals.
"At FPL, these include our service reliability metrics, our power plant availability metrics and our progress toward our goal to install 30 million solar panels by 2030."
We now expect to reach our solar panel installation goal by 2025.
"One of the main climate-change related risks facing FPL is more frequent storms, and our reliability metrics help us measure our progress in providing a stronger and more resilient energy grid."
"At NextEra Energy Resources, this includes our progress on completing the development of our wind, solar and storage projects on schedule and on budget, as well as adding significant new wind and solar opportunities to our backlog to support future growth."
Implementing our renewables development strategy has led to significant carbon-emission reductions for our company and our customers.
"Our smart, long-term investments, including in wind and solar, have helped us achieve a laudable reduction in our CO 2-emissions rate, achieving a 58% reduction from an adjusted 2005 baseline."
"As we implement Real Zero, our goal is to eliminate scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions from our operations by no later than 2045, beginning with a 70% reduction in our CO 2 rate by 2025."
* Read more about our Real Zero goal and our plan to achieve it in our Zero Carbon Blueprint .
"Our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions data is verified by an independent third party and available in Appendix E (Emissions Data and Third-Party Emissions Assurance Statement) of this report."
We also participate in the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) survey.
Our 2021 response is available on our Investor Relations website .
"* We are striving to achieve our goal of Real Zero emissions by no later than 2045 so long as there is no incremental cost to customers relative to alternatives, our efforts to do so are supported by cost-effective technology advancements and constructive government policies and incentives and our investments are acceptable to our regulators Throughout this report, we reference our adjusted 2005 baseline for our emissions-reduction goal."

"S. as measured by retail electricity produced and sold, serving approximately 5.8 million customer accounts or more than 12 million people across Florida from Miami to Pensacola."
"Our core philosophy, known as the virtuous circle, starts with providing customers a best- in-class value proposition of low bills, high reliability, clean energy solutions and excellent customer service."
"By delivering on these key commitments, we can drive high customer satisfaction, which leads to a constructive regulatory environment and the ability to have important conversations with regulators and elected officials at all levels about investments in new technologies."
"A constructive regulatory environment, in turn, attracts investment, which enables us to invest in projects that grow clean energy capacity, keep costs low for customers and improve reliability."
"From 2012 to 2021, FPL deployed approximately $51 billion in smart capital investments in Florida to continue to improve its customer value proposition."
"To help pay for these investments with minimal impact to customer bills, FPL has focused on lowering its operating costs for more than 30 years."
FPL has improved its operating costs from almost 10% worse than the industry average in 1988 to 65% better than the industry average by 2020.
"Relative to an average utilitys operation and maintenance (O&M) costs per retail megawatt hour (MWh), FPL saves its customers nearly $2.6 billion a year through its best-in-class cost profile."
"The result of these smart capital investments and continued focus on cost reduction is a typical 1,000-kilowatt hour (kWh) FPL residential customer bill that was approximately 28% lower than the national average as of year-end 2021 and among the lowest in the U."

"FPLs generation fleet is now one of the cleanest and most efficient in the country, saving customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs and avoiding more than 175 million tons of CO 2 emissions since 2001."
"In recent years, FPL acquired coal plants from which we were previously contractually obligated to purchase power and subsequently began to close and demolish these plants."
"FPL has permanently closed approximately 2,133 MW of coal generation, including joint ownership interests, since 2015."
"The Indiantown Cogeneration Plant was closed at the end of 2020, and the Gulf Clean Energy Center, formerly Plant Crist, was converted to natural gas, cutting its CO 2-emissions-rate by 40%."
"With the conversion of the Gulf Clean Energy Center and the retirement of Indiantown Cogeneration Plant, 2021 marked the first time in nearly 70 years that FPL had no coal-fired power plants in Florida."
"At the end of 2021, FPL formally retired its portion of a coal unit located in Georgia."
FPL has announced plans for retirements of two of its three remaining coal units outside of Florida by January 2024.
FPL also owns a 25% interest in an 860-MW coal unit at a multi-unit power plant in Georgia.
This unit in which we own an interest is slated to close around or before 2028.FPL has invested in natural gas generation to reduce dependence on oil and coal.
"Its highly efficient natural gas power generation fleet has helped drive these coal retirements, reduced costs for its customers and lowered its CO 2-emissions rate."
"Its natural gas units emit approximately one-third the CO 2 of similarly sized coal units, while maintaining affordability and reliability."
"In the future, we plan to adapt FPLs natural gas power generation fleet to use zero-carbon-emissions green hydrogen."
"In fact, FPL received approval to develop Floridas first green hydrogen plant, which is expected to come online in 2023 at our Okeechobee Clean Energy Center."
"Early investments in modernizations, such as green hydrogen, are an important part of our Real Zero journey and pave the way for cost-effective conversion of our existing natural gas-fired plants to green hydrogen."
"In addition, we are bringing the benefits of solar energy to the Sunshine State."
Solar is now the most cost-effective generation resource in most parts of FPLs service area.
FPL leads all utilities in the nation with the most universal solar capacity and is currently Floridas largest generator of solar power.
"In 2019, FPL announced its groundbreaking 30-by-30 plan, representing one of the largest solar expansions in the world."
"By April 2022, FPL passed the 50% mark toward completing the plan with 50 solar energy centers in operation."
FPL now expects to install 30 million solar panels across the state of Florida by 2025 five years ahead of schedule.
FPL is giving customers additional opportunities to invest in solar through the FPL SolarTogether program the largest community solar program in the U.
S.
"The program was initially launched in 2020 to provide customers the opportunity to offset their energy capacity with power from 20 universal solar energy centers totaling nearly 1,500 MW of capacity."
"20Due to the overwhelming popularity of SolarTogether, a program extension which would include 24 more solar energy centers and 1,788 MW of additional capacity was approved in 2021."
"SolarTogether also includes an allocated portion of solar capacity for low-income customers, which is the largest low-income solar offering in the country."
We are increasingly combining solar with low-cost battery energy storage.
"At the end of 2021, FPL commissioned the worlds largest solar-powered battery a 409-MW project adjacent to our Manatee solar facility in Manatee County, Florida."
"FPLs Ten-Year Site Plan , filed in April 2022, includes a significant increase in battery energy storage deployment with approximately 1,800 MW of new battery energy storage by 2031."
"We are excited about green hydrogen technology, which will be key to unlocking 100% carbon- free electricity through long battery energy storage created with solar power."
Green hydrogen is a versatile clean fuel and important to NextEra Energys Real Zero goal.
"Green hydrogen is made by using zero-carbon-emissions electricity to run an electrolyzer, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, while producing no greenhouse gas emissions."
Green hydrogen holds the promise of addressing hard-to-decarbonize sectors that are important drivers of economic growth in the U.
"S., such as manufacturing and heavy-duty transportation."

"Beyond our generation transformation, we are excited about the potential for the electrification of transportation."
"In 2019, FPL launched an innovative program designed to boost Floridas electric vehicle charging infrastructure, support EV adoption and increase range confidence."
"FPL EVolution will bring more than 1,000 charging ports to more than 200 locations across the FPL service area by the end of 2025, and is positioned to be one of the largest fast-charging networks in the state."
"The program includes more than 800 miles of strategically located, fast-charging stations, where EV drivers will be able to plug in every 25 miles along major highways, such as I-95, the Florida Turnpike and east-west corridors."
"With the addition of FPL EVolution Fleet and FPL EVolution Home, we also are meeting EV drivers needs at home, at work and on the road."
"On top of investments in EV charging, we partnered with the city of West Palm Beach to purchase five electric school buses for use by the citys parks and recreation department."
This project is the first of its kind in Florida and its just the beginning.
FPL also is leading by example when it comes to driving EVs.
"We are committed to converting 60% of our light-duty vehicle fleet to electric or plug-in hybrid by 2030, demonstrating our pledge to help Florida become a leader in sustainable transportation and our Real Zero goal to be zero-emitting by no later than 2045."
Building Americas smartest and strongest energy grid reliability and customer service Another example of FPLs strategy is our extensive effort to harden the energy grid and deploy smart grid technology.
"In 2004-2005, FPLs service area was hit by seven major hurricanes over 18 months, including Hurricane Wilma, which caused extensive damage throughout FPLs service area, requiring a total restoration time of more than two weeks."
"Since 2006, we have made significant investments to strengthen the energy grid to improve reliability for customers."
"By the end of 2021, we had hardened or undergrounded more than 65% of all main distribution power lines."
We also have replaced wood transmission structures so that 94% of these are now concrete or steel.
FPL was one of the early adopters of smart grid devices and today has approximately 6 million smart meters and intelligent devices on our grid.
Each day we collect about 1 billion data points from these devices and use predictive analytics and algorithms that we developed and patented to identify potential problems so we can fix them before our customers are interrupted and crews are dispatched.
Not having to dispatch a vehicle helps reduce our carbon footprint and reduces O&M costs.
"These intelligent devices can automatically redirect power, self-heal and eliminate or minimize customers affected, resulting in more than 10 million outages avoided over the last decade."
"We delivered our best-ever service reliability performance in 2021, continuing a trend in which weve improved reliability by nearly 45% since 2011."
Customers in Northwest Florida have seen an improvement of nearly 60% in reliability since becoming part of the FPL family in 2019.
"For the sixth time in seven years, FPL in 2021 was awarded the ReliabilityOne National Reliability Award, presented by PA Consulting, to the award recipient that has demonstrated sustained leadership, innovation and achievement in the area of electric reliability."
FPL expects to continue to invest in building the nations strongest and smartest energy grid.
"Under a Florida law enacted in 2019, we have filed a long-term Storm Protection Plan that details how we will continue to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient grid in the years ahead."
"The plan is a continuation of our successful storm hardening and preparedness program and includes additional hardening of overhead transmission and distribution facilities, as well as significant undergrounding of distribution lines."
"The undergrounding of neighborhood lines, or distribution laterals, will further enhance the networks overall reliability and resiliency."
"In addition, we intend to make further smart grid investments over the coming years and will continue to use emerging technology to find new, innovative ways to deliver cleaner, more reliable energy to customers."
FPL also focuses on providing best-in-class customer service.
The company received the top ranking in the southern U.
"S. among large electric providers, according to J."

Complaints recorded as logged in the FPSC Consumer Activity Report have dropped from 346 in 2010 to 102 in 2021 a 71% reduction.
"During the same period, the number of customers we serve increased by 15%."
Modernizing Northwest Florida with innovative infrastructure and first-class reliability We are committed to giving our customers in Northwest Florida the best electric service they have ever had.
"In the three years since welcoming Gulf Power into the NextEra Energy family, we have realized outstanding results toward this goal."
"On Jan. 1, 2021, Gulf Power merged into FPL with separate retail rates."
"Following unanimous regulatory approval of a comprehensive four-year-rate agreement, FPL began serving Northwest Florida under unified rates in 2022."
"NextEra Energy acquired Gulf Power in January 2019 and immediately began identifying investments to improve reliability and expand clean energy, while working to reduce costs for customers."
"Currently, FPL has 19 solar farms in operation or in development across Northwest Florida (not including solar on military installations) and even more in the works."
We completed the Gulf Clean Energy Center coal-to-natural gas conversion and accelerated shut down of its coal units.
"We also are constructing the North Florida Resiliency Connection (NFRC), a new transmission line that will connect the Northwest Florida and FPL systems."
It is expected to be completed in 2022.
The results of the work of our dedicated team and smart investments over the past years have been remarkable compared to industry standards.
"Due to our smart capital investments, Northwest Florida customers achieved a 24% improvement in CO 2-emissions rate over the last three years."
Under our Real Zero goal we will continue to reduce carbon emissions.
The investments we are making in Northwest Florida are the same types of investments that have made FPLs energy grid the strongest and most reliable in the nation.
Our service reliability in Northwest Florida has improved by nearly 60% since 2019.
"The improvements include a pilot program to replace select overhead power lines with underground lines in neighborhoods chosen based on past hurricane outages, vegetation-related service interruptions and other reliability data."
"A stronger and smarter energy grid helps prevent outages and restore power quicker * deployed ~6 million smart meters collect daily ~1 billion data pointsinstalled more than 200,000 intelligent devices** perform annually 26,000 miles of vegetation management hardened 94% of transmission structures which are now concrete or stee l * Data as of year-end 2021 unless otherwise shown."

"Today, new renewable energy resources are cheaper than the operating costs of many older, inefficient fossil generation units."
"With continued technology improvements and cost declines, we believe that by the latter part of this decade, after U."
"S. federal tax credits phase down, new near-firm (with battery energy storage) wind will be a $25 to $32 per MWh product and new near-firm (with battery energy storage) solar will be a $30 to $37 per MWh product, continuing to be the low-cost generation alternatives."
Market estimates now anticipate the renewable energy market to grow at roughly 15% per year through the next decade and that the wind and solar share of the nations generation mix could grow from less than 13% in 2021 to about 60% in 2035.
We have conducted a scenario analysis to model the U.
S. energy grid to determine how the U.
S. electric sector can achieve a 100% carbon-free electricity grid on a long-term horizon by 2050.
"Based on our analysis, we believe there is an opportunity to build approximately 3,600 GW, or more than 100 GW per year, of renewable energy and storage through 2050."
"Additionally, decarbonizing the electricity sector of the economy results in excess carbon-free energy that may be converted to green hydrogen to decarbonize other sectors of the economy."
This creates an estimated $4 trillion investment opportunity in renewable energy plus storage through 2050.
Positioned to decarbonize the U.
S. economy NextEra Energy Resources is key to NextEra Energys leadership in the decarbonization of the power sector and other parts of the U.

"In 2021, we added approximately 2,008 MW of new wind generating capacity and 728 MW of solar generating capacity, repowered 435 MW of wind generating capacity and increased our backlog of contracted renewable development projects."
We are well on our way to meeting our current development expectations for new signed contracts.
"Green hydrogen presents a particularly compelling new market for NextEra Energy Resources, where we have explored a number of pilot programs."
"A clean energy technology company with which we have partnered has developed proprietary processes to decarbonize industrial production of hydrogen at economic prices and recently won conditional approval for an approximately $1 billion Department of Energy loan to expand its methane pyrolysis process facilities in Nebraska that produce clean hydrogen and low-emissions carbon black, which is primarily used in manufacturing tires, plastics, inks and toners, and other products."
Our agreement with this company provides NextEra Energy Resources the opportunity to be its preferred renewable energy supplier for the manufacturing facility.
"Similarly, we also have partnered with a liquid fuels company with a proprietary process to produce zero-emissions synthetic fuels by combining green hydrogen with concentrated CO 2 streams captured from industrial processes."
"Our strategic partnership with this company includes the opportunity for NextEra Energy Resources to provide up to 3,000 MW of renewable energy under a preferential energy supply agreement."
"In addition to assisting customers with the transition to sustainable and zero-carbon- emissions transportation, we are helping our customers optimize their energy use and reach their own carbon-reduction goals."
Our NextEra 360 software platform leverages data from NextEra Energy Resources world-leading renewable fleet.
The software is part of our broader suite of sustainability solutions that help our customers navigate the sustainability journey to achieve their own Real Zero.
"In addition, we are helping to change the landscape of water resource management through NextEra Distributed Waters on-site reclamation and reuse services."
"The companys ecologically engineered, district-scale water recycling systems, called Water Hubs, reduce water supply risk, have the potential to save millions of dollars in utility costs and improve environmental stewardship."
"As we execute our Real Zero goal and develop additional renewable energy opportunities over the coming years, we expect to deliver benefits for customers and many other stakeholders."
"Older, inefficient and higher-cost generation units will be replaced with clean low-cost wind and solar, reducing customer costs, emissions, water use and waste."
The billions of dollars of investments we plan to make will support local communities and create attractive construction and operations job opportunities.
"Finally, shareholders will benefit through execution of a sustainable business strategy that also delivers attractive long-term growth."

"Climate change, decarbonization and Real Zero carbon emissions reductions We believe our industry can best confront climate change by investing in clean power generation that produces zero or low emissions."
This has been part of the strategy across all of our businesses for a long period of time and is a key element of our Real Zero goal.
Our portfolio has one of the lowest emissions profiles of any utility in North America.
"In 2021, sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and CO 2 rates were 98%, 74% and 51% lower, respectively, than the U."
S. electric power sector average.
We have also set a clear goal to reduce carbon emissions further with Real Zero and are making excellent progress toward that achievement.
"Our near-term goal is to reduce our CO 2-emissions rate 70% by 2025 from an adjusted 2005 baseline, while our long-term goal is to achieve Real Zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045."
"From 2005 to 2021, NextEra Energy reduced its CO 2-emissions rate by 58%."
*FPL biologist Mary Jo Hernandez uses a test strip to measure water pH as part of routine monitoring around the Turkey Point Clean Energy Center in Florida.
"* We are striving to achieve our goal of Real Zero emissions by no later than 2045 so long as there is no incremental cost to customers relative to alternatives, our efforts to do so are supported by cost-effective technology advancements and constructive government policies and incentives and our investments are acceptable to our regulators."

"Our verified scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions data and additional information can be found in Appendix E (Emissions data and third-party emissions assurance statement) of this report."
Water availability Water is a vital natural resource.
"We continue to take measures to reduce our water consumption, including investing in both water-free power generation from wind and PV solar, and in more efficient generation at our facilities that use steam turbines."
"To ensure sustainable access to water, we are active stewards of sourcing, using and managing this critical resource in the communities in which we operate."
We embed water conservation management strategies into our business planning and operational practices to lower costs and mitigate risks posed by water availability.
"We reduce consumption through efficiency, technology and operational improvements."
"Our investments in water-free wind and PV solar energy, which currently comprise more than a third of our companys generating capacity, avoided the use of more than 20 billion gallons of water in 2021."
"Nearly 74% of the water NextEra Energy generating facilities withdrew in 2021 came from saltwater sources, which are non-potable and not subject to drought."

"30Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022 Importantly, 98% of water withdrawn for use at our natural gas plants is withdrawn via a once- through cooling system and then returned to its original source."
The remainder is reused or consumed through evaporation or deep-well injection.
Only one of 25 of our generation facilities that use water is located in a region of high or extremely high water stress in the U.
S.
"In 2021, we used 7.1 billion gallons of reclaimed water for cooling purposes."
Doing so offsets the demand for higher-quality water and reduces water supply risk.
"We continue to find innovative ways at our generation facilities to use the lowest- quality water sources, including reclaimed water, which reduce impacts to higher-quality sources like groundwater."
"At FPLs Sanford Plant, we are transitioning from using groundwater to surface water, which assists the St. Johns River Water Management District in protecting the Volusia Blue Spring."
"Additionally, at FPLs Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, we are deepening a groundwater well to use lesser quality water from the Avion Park Production Zone, instead of sourcing water from the Upper Floridan Aquifer."
"In June 2020, the Miami-Dade County Commission approved FPLs proposed development of an advanced reclaimed water project to reuse treated wastewater from the county at FPLs Turkey Point Clean Energy Center."
The state-of-the-art FPL Miami-Dade Clean Water Recovery Center (CWRC) will further treat and reuse up to 15 million gallons of reclaimed water per day from the South District Wastewater Treatment Plant in Miami-Dade County.
FPL will use 100% of that reclaimed water to cool a natural gas plant at Turkey Point.
"A win-win for FPL customers, Miami-Dade County and the Sunshine State, the CWRC will increase resiliency at the Turkey Point Clean Energy Center, provide a cost-effective way to reuse and recycle treated wastewater that would otherwise be discarded, and conserve Floridan Aquifer groundwater at the Turkey Point site."
"The CWRC also will help Miami-Dade County meet regulations of the Ocean Outfall Act, which set a state requirement for Miami- Dade County to reuse 60% of its wastewater."
Reducing waste We believe the best way to deliver environmental value by minimizing our waste footprint begins with reducing the amount of waste we generate in the first place.
"Then, we look for opportunities to reuse and recycle materials to minimize the waste that we send to local landfills."
"From modernizing many of our facilities and reducing the amount of oil-ash generated to banning the use of chlorinated solvents at all facilities and continuing to phase out polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) equipment, we are reducing the amount of waste generated."
"We have greatly reduced the amount of hazardous waste we generate to maintain the status of a Very Small Quantity Generator, the lowest possible federal regulatory classification."
"NextEra Energy provides documented training to employees to ensure that hazardous waste, when generated, is properly identified, stored, disposed or recycled."
"All aspects of waste management are validated through facility environmental audits that include records review, site inspection and personnel interviews."
"In addition, all waste management vendors receive an environmental audit from either internal audit personnel or through CHWMEG, a nonprofit trade association, and its global Facility Review Program."
"Active engagement with industry groups, like Cross-Cutting Issues Group and the Electric Power Research Institute, also helps ensure understanding of evolving standards and compliance obligations."
We also seek opportunities to identify and implement reuse and recycling programs that result in environmental and economic benefits.
"In 2021, our corporate recycling and services facility reconditioned and redirected $4.7 million worth of equipment back into inventory."
"In addition, our investment recovery team engages a seven-step process for asset disposition when assets reach the end-of-use stage: reuse, recondition, return, resell, reclaim, recycle and remove."
"In 2021, FPL was awarded the Trailblazer Award from the Florida Recycling Partnership Foundation for the investment recovery operation."

"FPL replaces poles as needed due to aging, storms and grid hardening efforts."
These poles include both wood and reinforced concrete.
"Historically, wood poles were cut into manageable pieces and collected for landfill disposal."
"Concrete poles would be transported to a crusher, with FPL covering transit costs."
"The team identified a source to recycle wood and concrete poles and reduce landfill costs, saving $400,000 in cost avoidance and keeping 20.5 million pounds of debris out of the landfill."
Our partner provides one-stop support for all poles.
"About 75% of the wood poles are now redeployed to landscapers or other end re-users so only 25% go to landfill, while all concrete poles are crushed and used as aggregate."
"While our solar and wind fleet are still early in their operating lives, we are working with our vendors on recycling plans."
"We have proactively worked with solar vendors on plans to first reuse solar infrastructure components when a site is decommissioned and, in the event they cannot be reused, to recycle them."
We have recently employed the same collaboration with wind vendors for waste management as we decommission or repower wind sites.
Many of our wind vendors have made significant strides in recycling.
This was recently demonstrated by GE Renewable Energys announcement that it has entered into long-term contracts to recycle blades removed from its U.
S.-based turbines during upgrades or repowering.
The recycled blades are used as a raw material for cement.
"In 2021, 580 blades from five projects were identified for recycling, including 393 that were removed in 2020 and recycled in 2021 and an additional 287 blades that were removed in 2021 to be recycled in 2022."
Preserving and protecting habitat and wildlife Environmental stewardship includes habitat and wildlife protection.
"Before we build any operating facility, we study the local ecosystem so that we can better understand what it takes to be a partner in its preservation and to be a good neighbor to all the species that live there."
"We carefully consider the presence of any threatened or endangered species, as well as significant wildlife corridors, wetlands or other ecologically important areas."

"The Land- Based Wind Energy Guidelines, Avian Protection Plan Guidelines and Manatee Protection Plans are among numerous policies and programs aimed at protecting threatened and endangered species that we follow across our operations."
"In addition to following all federal and state regulations, we make important contributions to scientific research to protect numerous vulnerable species and habitats and to better understand how to reduce impacts."
Several examples of our wildlife and habitat restoration projects are featured below.
"Solar stewardship At our Florida solar energy centers, we work with Audubon Florida and other local organizations to craft site-specific enhancement and preservation plans focused on providing habitat opportunities for birds, pollinators and other wildlife."
"This is accomplished through a variety of prescriptive methodologies, including but not limited to: restoring hydrology to wetlands, increasing biodiversity through the use of appropriate native plant species, applying integrated Two caracara and a red-shouldered hawk scout for prey at our Blue Heron Solar Energy Center in Hendry County, Fla.approaches to minimize the prevalence of invasive species, incorporating pollinator species into ground covers and installing of artificial perches, nest boxes and platforms for wildlife use."
"For example, to avoid disrupting the delicate Florida ecosystem, sites within panther habitat include wildlife-friendly fencing."
This special fencing is designed so that both panther prey species and panthers themselves can pass through or over the fence.
"At our FPL Hammock Solar Energy Center, which has been operating since 2018, we conducted a study with 20 cameras set along the perimeter fence and throughout the site to ensure that animals were able to access and use the site successfully and safely."
"In 2021, the company standardized the use of wildlife-friendly fencing at all future solar sites in Florida to further allow for wildlife use."
"Outside of Florida, we follow a similar process."
NextEra Energy Resources evaluates opportunities to implement additional voluntary stewardship actions on a project-by-project basis.
Voluntary stewardship supplements the development process and takes further steps to preserve and enhance existing natural resources.

"Monarch butterfly and pollinators To demonstrate our commitment to protect pollinators and their habitats, FPL is one of the first electric utilities to have enrolled in the voluntary Monarch Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances."
"By enrolling, FPL has committed to implement measures to create conservation benefits for the monarch butterfly."
These measures can also benefit other pollinators.
"In addition to direct habitat conservation measures, it is also important to contribute to our scientific understanding of pollinator preservation."
NextEra Energy is engaged in a research partnership with the University of Illinois Chicagos Energy Resources Center (UIC-ERC) to answer key questions at the intersection of insect pollinator conservation and solar power.
"The study, entitled Evaluation of Economic, Ecological, and Performance Impacts of Co-Located Pollinator Plantings at Large-Scale Solar Installations, will examine the economic, ecological and performance impacts of pollinator habitats co-located at five large-scale solar PV facilities in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, one of which is a subsidiary of NextEra Energy."
"Wildlife and habitat research NextEra Energy Resources participates in the Renewable Energy Wildlife Research Fund (REWRF), which is housed within the Renewable Energy Wildlife Institute, an independent, nonprofit organization that works to solve renewable energy, wildlife, and related natural resource challenges through sound science and collaboration."
"The REWRF is currently funding innovative research projects related to bats, eagles and grouse, and will be expanding into solar research topics to better understand the potential impacts on species and habitat."
"REWRF will also explore potential benefits to ecosystem services that solar energy can provide (pollination, soil preservation, water quality, etc.)."
All research is conducted by independent third parties and will be peer reviewed and publicly released.
"Manatees For decades, FPL has worked closely with state and federal agencies to ensure manatees are protected."

"The energy center, located in the northern Indian River Lagoon, is a critical stop-off point, where manatees congregate as they migrate south during the winter."
"We eagerly worked with the FWC to assist in the effort and pledged to contribute more than $700,000 over the next three years to help with manatee rescue and rehabilitation, education and habitat restoration."
"Contents Vision and strategy: Our chairman, president and CEO NextEra Energys blueprint to reach Real Zero Confronting climate change About this report NextEra Energys ESG journey Our portfolio Building the worlds leading clean energy provider Environmental Social Governance Risks and opportunities 2021-2022 awards and recognitions Conclusion Appendices Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022 34Researchers determined the cause of the manatee UME is starvation attributed to a lack of seagrass, a primary food source, in the Indian River Lagoon."
Supporting research to restore and recover seagrass can positively benefit the health of Florida manatees.
"With this knowledge, the NextEra Energy Foundation provided grants to the Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Foundation for the FAU Harbor Branch Experimental Seagrass Nursery and to the Florida Oceanographic Society to support seagrass research and on-site seagrass nursery operations."
"Additionally, in partnership with the Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida, FPL funded a new manatee rescue transport truck for FWC."
This truck was added to the FWC fleet to expand rescue efforts and transport sick or injured manatees to rehabilitation facilities throughout Florida.
American crocodiles On the brink of extirpation from the U.
"S. in the late 1970s due to habitat loss, the American crocodile has made a dramatic comeback in the habitat surrounding FPLs Turkey Point Clean Energy Center."
"In the 1980s, FPL initiated a crocodile management program at the plant."
"This plant has a 5,900-acre, manmade cooling canal system and surrounding land that offers ideal nesting conditions for the American crocodile."
"Our crocodile management program includes protecting these nesting areas, completing population surveys, conducting capture and spatial distribution surveys, and regulating plant activity at night and during nesting season."
"In 2021, FPL biologists captured, tagged and released a record setting 565 hatchlings."
"Our strategy to prepare historical nesting locations before the season and improve the water quality of the cooling canal system led to 27 successful nests in 2021, the second-highest year on record, behind 28 successful nests in 2008."
Avian protection programs We have taken the initiative to protect bird species through several innovative programs.
"When siting projects, we are dedicated to avoiding and minimizing impacts to both terrestrial and avian species and their habitat."
"For NextEra Energy Resources wind facilities, we follow industry and agency guidelines, which include voluntarily collecting and providing eagle nesting and avian point count survey data results, as well as post-construction mortality monitoring results, to the USFWS."
"Our practice also is to site our turbines at least 2 miles away from every known eagle nest, unless otherwise approved by USFWS."
"In addition to our siting practices, we use IdentiFlight, a developing automated technology used to detect, identify and protect eagles at wind farms by using high performance optical systems paired with machine vision software."
"Golden Hills Wind, LLC has been conducting a pilot project using this technology to minimize effects to golden eagles at the site."
"By detecting an eagle as far as 1 kilometer out from an operating wind turbine, in real time, the IdentiFlight system maximizes the protection for eagles compared to other non-automated systems."
"The pilot project, at the two-year mark, is demonstrating very promising results."
"In addition to our project specific work, we have funded several research projects related to eagle population assessments and eagle conservation."
NextEra Energy Resources also has recently reached a voluntary agreement with the federal government pursuant to which it will spend up to approximately $27 million to minimize additional eagle deaths and injuries at approximately 50 of its existing wind facilities.
"NextEra Energy Resources continues to minimize our interactions with bald and golden eagles through our siting practices, research and conservation."
See our statement for additional details.
"Since 2007, FPL has invested more than $130 million to construct and retrofit more than 150,000 poles to make them more bird-friendly, reducing avian risk and improving service reliability to our customers."
"To identify and proactively address high-risk distribution structures, FPL created the energy industrys first avian risk assessment model."
"In 2014, FPL updated the avian risk assessment model to further enhance avian assessment for eagles and wood storks and protection processes."

FPL launched the hub in February 2020 and received 70 applications from around the world.
FPL chose six companies to join 35 Mules for its first cohort.
The 13 founders had a dedicated workspace on FPLs Juno Beach campus for 15 months.
"During their time in the program, the startups raised $15 million in grant funding and venture capital, met with more than 150 NextEra Energy subject-matter experts, and received more than 200 hours of formal training in legal, marketing, human resources, customer discovery and more."
"In March 2022, FPL welcomed its second cohort 14 entrepreneurs in seven startup companies into its program."
"These startups are in various industries, including maritime, industrial professional services, raw materials, asset and vegetation risk management, consumer electronics, cleantech, aviation and aerospace, and information technology."
"The programs unique name comes from FPLs humble beginnings in 1925, when a very unlikely patchwork of enterprises combined to form the precursor to NextEra Energy, including an ice plant, a sponge boat and 35 mules."
Economic development NextEra Energy is one of the largest infrastructure companies and among the largest capital investors in the U.

The committee consists of officers and key personnel from across the company.
"The committee meets four times per year and discusses risks and related mitigation activities, and performs detailed reviews of risks, as appropriate."
"Risks are assessed based on impact, probability and speed of onset."
"Representatives of the committee then meet twice a year with the risk lead team, which is comprised of the chairman, president and CEO, CFO and general counsel, to review and provide feedback on the results of the committees work."
The risk assessment activities and results are reported to the audit committee of the board of directors annually.
The corporate risk management committee has established relationships within the risk community and continuously works to ensure our risk program stays current and relevant.
"In 2021, the committee participated in enterprise risk management roundtables with companies both within and outside the utility industry."
"We also have an exposure management committee, which has policy oversight of the risk profiles of our energy marketing and trading and power marketing businesses."
This committee meets monthly and is chaired by the CFO.
"The exposure management committee reviews all market, credit and operational issues associated with energy trading and reports to the finance and investment committee of the board of directors at least annually."
It also reports to the audit committee on all matters of internal control and financial reporting associated with this business.
We employ a robust risk management process to all of our investment decisions.
"Our investment decisions are rooted in realistic assumptions, with appropriate sensitivity analyses, as needed, to ensure a data-driven decision-making process."
Across all of our businesses there is a robust due diligence and project approval process intended to ensure that all significant risks have been identified and mitigated to the greatest extent possible.
"All significant investment decisions are reviewed and approved by NextEra Energys operating committee, which is comprised of all senior executives and other executives from the various functional departments of each of our businesses."
"Investments of greater dollar value require additional authorizations, up to and including approval by the boards finance and investment committee and the full NextEra Energy board of directors, depending on the nature and amount of the investment."

Our carbon footprint and potential climate-related risks are incorporated into this planning process.
"Different options are evaluated taking into account system economics, forecasted electric power demand, demand-side management, fuel prices, potential future climate policies, and the integration of low-cost, clean and reliable generation, including solar and battery energy storage solutions."
Our capital allocation process at FPL is centered on enhancing the overall customer value proposition to deliver long-term customer benefits and the support of regulators for our investment decisions.
Review of NextEra Energy Resources investment decisions begins with thorough due diligence by subject matter experts from nearly 20 key functional areas.
"These subject matter experts, who bring deep experience and expertise, help identify and assess the commercial, financial and operational feasibility of new project investment opportunities."
We also have processes in place to ensure we are continuously learning from unforeseen challenges to improve future capital allocation decisions.
"FPL and NextEra Energy Resources hold annual strategy sessions with business unit leadership across each organization to identify and review long-term goals, risks and opportunities."
"The results of these annual strategy sessions are reviewed with the board of directors to ensure key risks are identified and managed, and opportunities to enhance customer and shareholder value creation are pursued."
"For the purposes of our risk management process, we do not view climate change as a discrete risk, but rather a potential stress multiplier to existing risks and opportunities already under consideration."
"For example, system disruption from a weather event is a long-standing risk that we have integrated into our risk-assessment process, and potential climate change projections for more frequent storms would be a multiplier for this risk category but not necessarily broken out as an incremental, separate impact."
We also recognize that climate change may affect different parts of our business in different ways.
We provide more details on our approach to managing environmental risks and our strategy under Environment in this report.
"Preparing for storms, flooding and sea-level rise Physical risks are reviewed as part of our corporate risk management process, including the risks of more frequent and severe storms, flooding and sea-level rise as a result of climate change."
"Our experience and history of managing hurricanes and natural disasters in Florida provides us with the skills and capabilities to remain focused on safety, execution and the importance of providing an essential service to our customers during these events."
"54Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022 FPL is building a stronger, smarter and more resilient energy grid that improves reliability in good weather and bad, and enables faster power restoration following extreme weather events."
"Since 2006, FPL has made significant investments in strengthening the energy grid to make it more resilient to severe weather."
The deployment of innovative technology to help prevent outages and shorten restoration times when outages occur has enabled FPL to lower operating costs and improve reliability and resiliency.
Specific investments in the FPL system include: Hardening or undergrounding power lines to better withstand higher winds to enhance service reliability and resiliency.
"Upgrading transmission line structures, replacing wood structures with concrete or steel, maintaining vegetation along more than 26,000 miles of power lines each year and inspecting all 1.4 million power poles within an eight-year cycle."
"Installing more than 200,000 intelligent devices that prevent power outages and shorten restoration times by automatically redirecting power, self-healing and minimizing customers affected, resulting in more than 10 million outages avoided over the last decade."
"Using drones equipped with artificial intelligence, machine learning and geospatial data so flights are fully autonomous, as well as developing in-house image recognition software to spot faulty equipment and prevent outages."
"FPL crews work to restore power following a storm in West Palm Beach, Fla."
Our emergency preparation efforts to strengthen the grid against storms and train for quick storm response increases reliability for our customers.

Our Florida nuclear facilities are elevated 20 feet above sea level to protect against flooding and extreme storm surge.
We expect to continue to make additional resiliency and reliability investments over the coming decades to mitigate any potential impacts to our system.
"Mitigation actions taken to date include: Installing pumps, flood control structures, monitoring sensors and raised equipment in high-risk flood zones."
Designing our substation yards to meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 100-year flood elevations.
"Deploying mobile substations and transformers, along with other equipment, that can be used to respond to flood or storm events."
Hardening underground structures and using above-ground equipment in high-risk flood zones.
"Deploying innovative technology at locations more susceptible to storm surge, such as a temporary AquaDam we installed at one of FPLs coastal substations in North Florida."
A good example of how our storm hardening investments have created value for our customers is to compare the last two major hurricanes that hit FPLs service area: Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and Hurricane Irma in 2017.
"Although Irma was a more powerful storm, with nearly 50% greater damage potential than Wilma, FPL was able to reduce the average number of outage days per customer by 60%."
"Hurricane Irma was the largest hurricane event FPL has ever faced with more than 4.4 million, or nearly 90% of customers, losing power compared to roughly 3.2 million, or 75% of customers, due to Hurricane Wilma."
"As a result of our storm hardening investments, FPL improved restoration times, sustained less equipment damage, lost fewer poles and brought our generation facilities back faster than ever."
These investments also avoided significant economic loss in FPLs service area and across Florida.
"55Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022 FPL line workers work to repair damaged power lines in South Miami-Dade County, Fla., after Hurricane Irma, one of the Atlantics strongest and costliest hurricanes."

"For nearly 70 years, we have conducted annual drills to prepare for all types of emergencies."
"It is this type of preparation to handle the unexpected that we believe will enable us to continue to deliver for our customers over the long-term, no matter what may come our way."
"We are continuously monitoring and preparing for the unexpected and have teams in place that regularly test our systems, operations and people to ensure they are prepared to manage any emergency whether its a storm, cyber event, oil spill, capacity shortfall or even a global pandemic."
"56Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2022 FPL conducts an annual week-long storm drill, which tests the response of employees to a hypothetical hurricane."
"These drills, which traditionally include local first responders, as well as state and federal officials, provide opportunities to demonstrate how we continuously improve and are ready to respond together with local and state partners to return life to normal for millions of Floridians in their greatest time of need."
"Every year, our drills are a commitment to push ourselves and improve upon our procedures when responding to a natural disaster."
"During the simulated exercises, FPL employees are evaluated on response and restoration efforts related to operations, logistics, communications and customer service, among other areas."

"CY20 21 GHG Inventory 1 | Page Background Cameron -Cole, LLC (Cameron -Cole) has been retained by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra Energy) to perform a verification of its Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory for calendar year (CY) 202 1."
NextEra Energy prepared its Scope 1 and 2 GHG Inventory using WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol (GHG Protocol) and associated amendments.
The Scope 3 GHG Inventory was prepared using WRI /WBCSD Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard dated September 2011 and associated amendments.
Cameron -Cole also verified NextEra Energy s GHG emissions rate (lbs of CO 2 per MWh) as part of this engagement.
"Our opinion on the results of the inventory , with respect to the verification objectives and criteria, is provided in this statement ."
Responsibility of NextEra Energy & Independence of Verification Provider NextEra Energy has sole responsibility for th e content of its GHG Inventory .
Cameron -Cole accepts no responsibilit y for any changes that may have occurred to the GHG emissions results since they were submitted to us for review.
"Based on internationally accepted norms for impartiality, we believe our review represents an independent assessment of NextEra Energy s CY2021 GHG Emissions Inventory ."
"Finally, the opinion expressed in this verification statement should not be relied upon as the basis for any financial or investment decisions."
"Level of Assurance The level of assurance is used to determine the depth of detail that a Verification Body designs into the Verification Plan to dete rmine if there are material errors , omissions or misstatements in a company's GHG assertions ."
Two levels of assurance are generally recognized reasonable and limited.
Reasonable Assurance generate s the highest level of confidence that an emissions repo rt is materially correct (with the exception of Absolute Assurance which is generally impractical for companies to achieve) .
"Limited Assurance provide s less confidence, and involve s less detailed examination of GHG data and supporting documentation."
Limi ted Assurance statements assert that there is no evidence that an emissions report is not materially correct.
Cameron -Coles verification of NextEra Energy s GHG Emissions Inventory and emissions rate for CY 2021 was constructed to provide a Limited Level of Assurance.
"Objectives The primary objectives of this verification assignment were as follows: Determine whether NextEra Energy s 2021 GHG emissions inventory meets/exceeds the 95% threshold for accuracy for Scope 1 and 2 combine and for Scope 3 emissions, assessed separately, Determine whether NextEra Energy s 2021 NextEra Energy s GHG emissions rate (lbs of CO 2 per MWh) meets/exceeds t he 95% threshold for accuracy and , Evaluate the conformance of NextEra Energy s accounting and calculation methodologies, processes and systems to the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol and WRI/WBCSD Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard ."
