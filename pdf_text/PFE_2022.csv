"Introduction Environment Introduction Impact Stories Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report4 Letter from our Chairman & CEO Stepping Up to Meet the Demands of a Changing World At Pfizer, our purposeBreakthroughs that change patients livesdrives us to be a force for good in the world."
"We believe that scientific innovation can help people live longer, healthier lives, and we are proud to continue to advance our scientific pipeline and strengthen our research and development in support of this goal."
"Specifically, to help ensure science will win against ongoing and future health threats, we invested approximately $11.4 billion in internal research and development programs in 2022."
"While many people know about what Pfizer does, fewer know how we go about this work in a way that fulfills our purpose, builds trust, and takes accountability for the impact we make on society."
"We take our work seriously, as the impact is felt by not only the more than 1.3 billion patients treated with our medicines and vaccines in 20221, but also the communities in which we, and our stakeholders, live and work."
"2022like the two years preceding itwas punctuated by a growing number of daunting global challengesfrom COVID-19, which remains a threat to global health, to political and economic instability, to the armed conflict in Ukraine, to increased attacks on marginalized groups that have made it harder for people to live safe, healthy, and productive lives."
"At the same time, continued climate change has led to observable effectsfr om floods and heat waves to droughts and dwindling ice capsand may be linked to not-so-obvious effects, such as potential increased health risks from air pollution, extreme weather events, and pressures on mental health."
"Global action and collaboration are needed to address these issues, and as a private-sector leader, Pfizer is committed to responding."
"At Pfizer, our commitment is anchored to our six ESG priorities: product innovation; equitable access and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity, and inclusion; climate change; and business ethics."
"Our progress in these areas is detailed in this report, and we look forward to continuing to engage with colleagues and other stakeholders to hear how we can continue to enhance our impact, both within and outside of Pfizer ."
"We also continue to refine the metrics we use to measure our performance as the voluntary and emerging regulatory frameworks governing ESG reporting evolve at the local, national, regional, and global level."
Acting Ethically Our approach to helping address the issues facing our planet and its people is rooted in our purpose.
"And while our breakthroughs can take the form of new medicines and vaccines, they can also shape new ways of working, new ways of helping ensure equitable access to our innovations, and new ways of leveraging our voice."
"Were a company that is guided by our valuescourage, excellence, equity, and joy."
"To that end, we deploy an ethical decision-making framework that seeks to guide how we discuss, consider and act to help address global challenges."
"Values-and ethics-based decision-making promotes accountability and helps ensure that integrity, quality, safety, and ethics are foundational to all we do."
Actions > Words These decisions have led to action.
"For example, we remain committed to working towards equitable and affordable access to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Pfizers oral therapy for people around the world."
Why?
Because our vaccines and medicines cannot positively impact patients if those patients do not have access to them.
This commitment to equitable access extends beyond COVID-19.
We live in a time when science can increasingly take on the worlds most devastating diseases.
"But there is a gap determining who can access these innovations, and who cannot."
"To help bridge this gap, we announced in May 2022 that we will provide on a not-for-profit basis all our innovative medicines and vaccines available in the U."
"S. or the European Union to 1.2 billion people in 45 lower-income countries and will work closely with global health leaders to make improvements in diagnosis, education, infrastructure, storage, and more."
"The Accord for a Healthier Worldwhich we expanded in January 2023 to include the full portfolio of products for which we have global rights, bringing the total offering from 23 patented medicines and vaccines to around 500 patented and off-patent productsaims to greatly reduce the health inequities that exist between many lower-income countries and the rest of the world."

"We remain deeply concerned by the human suffering we have witnessed during the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine, and we are committed to contributing to ongoing humanitarian efforts that support the safety, health, and wellbeing of people affected by this tragic event."
"We are determined to ensure the safety of our colleagues and their families, and we are equally determined to facilitate continued access to our medicines and vaccines for patients."
But we r ecognize that we are in a position to do even more.
"That is why, effective March 14, 2022, Pfizer began donating profits of our Russian subsidiary to the Pfizer Foundation2 for direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine, in addition to our ongoing humanitarian response efforts in the region."
"Pfizer, through The Pfizer Foundation, has committed over $30 million to support these efforts."
We believe that product donations play an important role in relief and humanitarian emergencies.
We are proud to work through established non-governmental organizations with expertise in managing product donations in connection with humanitarian emergencies.
"In 2022, this included Hurricane Fiona, Hurricane Ian, the Afghanistan earthquake, and the flooding in Pakistan."
"We recognize that planetary health has a profound impact on human health, which is why we are building on more than 20 years of climate action to reduce our company and value chain Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions."
"In June 2022, we announced our aim to achieve the voluntary Net-Zero Standard by 2040, ten years earlier than the timeline described in the standard."
"As part of this commitment, we aim to reduce our company GHG emissions by 95 percent and our value chain GHG emissions by 90 percent from 2019 levels through accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels and engaging suppliers to catalyze equivalent action."
"Force for Good As we look ahead, as remarkable as 2022 has been for Pfizer, I believe we have only scratched the surface of the transformative impact we can have on human health."
"Our third ESG Report, which shares our vision and approach, showcases progress on key strategies and reaffirms our commitment to keeping patients at the center of all we do and to furthering the positive impact that we have on the world."
"Nobody can predict with certainty how the world will change in 2023, and what challenges humankind will have to overcome."
But I do know this: all of us at Pfizer consider it a privilege to be allowed by society to help address these issues.
"Against this backdrop, we remain committed to keeping patients as our North Star, applying ethical decision-making frameworks to our work, embedding ESG into our corporate strategies, and continuing to be a force for good in the world."

"ESG best practice is often recognized as aligning and embedding robust ESG management into our strategyso that the company and its priority ESG workstreams move together, leading to opportunities of mutual reinforcement and impact."
We have continuously refined our ESG strategy in alignment with our purpose and corporate strategy.
"Building on our effortswhich include our acquisition of Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc. to help underserved patient communities, such as those with sickle cell disease, as well as expanded access programming through An Accord for a Healthier World we more purposefully integrated ESG into our ways of working in 2022, including strategic decisions, business operations, and governance, to create greater ownership of impact at all levels."
"In 2023, we aim to further integrate ESG into our corporate strategy, reinforcing our commitment to being a purpose- driven organization."
"By embedding ESG into our strategy, we can make it the common denominator that underpins how we fulfill our commitments to our stakeholders."
"For example, in our financing strategy, we were the first U."

"The ESG function within Pfizer and its cross-functional governing committees (at the senior management and the executive level) have responsibility for considering and adopting potential goals and targets, with escalation to the Governance & Sustainability Committee (G&SC) of the Board, based on input from experienced subject matter experts and advisors."
Our efforts are directed towards making an impact that furthers our purpose to improve patients lives and support the global communities we aim to serve.
"Pfizers ESG Priority Areas: Product innovation Product quality and safety Diversity, equity, and inclusion Equitable access and pricing Business ethics Climate changeIn 2020, we led an in-depth priority assessment that helped map ESG issues and their relative impact on our business and expectations of our stakeholders."
"We identified 30 priority topics and mapped these to our six ESG priority areas, which in turn closely align to our corporate strategy, as well as the risks and opportunities identified with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach."
These six priority issues are consistent with our values and our patient-centric approach.
"In 2022, we continued to engage a variety of stakeholdersincluding patients, caregivers, investors, colleagues, and partnersto better understand their changing needs, interests and expectations of Pfizer."
"These insights further sharpened the focus of our ESG strategy on the issues important to our stakeholders, while also monitoring and managing the other issues in our ESG priority assessment."
"Environment Introduction Impact Stories Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report11 IntroductionPriority ESG Issues Continued Environment Introduction Impact Stories Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report12 IntroductionPriority ESG Issues Continued Based on our six ESG priority areas, we have identified, set and communicated public ESG goals so that our stakeholders understand how we are measuring success."
"We believe that setting and publicizing our goals energizes our colleagues, showcases our priorities, and demonstrates transparency to external stakeholders."
"By tracking our work, we can better understand what works, what doesnt, and whether we are living up to the goals we are setting for ourselves."
"For example, with regards to our climate change goal, we aim to achieve the voluntary Net-Zero Standard by 2040, ten years earlier than the expectations of the Standard."
This goal informs our aim to reduce our company emissions by 95 percent and our value chain emissions by 90 percent from 2019 levels by 2040.
"With regards to our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goal, by 2025 we aim to achieve global workforce parity of 47 percent for women at the Vice President+ level, and 32 percent for U."

"Each one brings a unique perspective to the table, and we collaborate with them at various levels to inform our ESG strategy and make a positive impact internally and externally."
Patients and Caregivers Patients are our North Star.
We work with patients and their caregivers to understand their needs and help ensure that our medicines and vaccines work to address them.
"As part of this, we engage with patients and patient advocacy groups to listen, learn, collaborate, and address areas of unmet patient need and to incorporate their perspectives before we launch our medicines and vaccines."
"In 2022, Pfizers Global Patient Advocacy Team engaged more than 1,800 global patient advocacy organizations across North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia through trainings, workshops, and webinars focused on health policy issues, capacity building, patient centricity, and patient education and information."
"In 2022, we also hosted our second annual event, Patients in Focus, which recognizes the influence that patients have on every facet of our work."
"Pfizer CEO and Chairman, Albert Bourla, as well as other leadership met directly with patients and advocates to learn about their experiences and discuss how Pfizer can continue to embed the patient perspective into our work to discover, develop, and bring to market medicines and vaccines."
"Shareholders and Investors Our shareholders, investors, and analysts have a vested interest in Pfizers operations and the short, medium, and long term success of Pfizer."
"We work to engage investors on ESG issues through ongoing one-on-one conversations, surveys and questionnaires, and targeted communications, for example ESG- related content on our Investor Insights website."
"We also host investor-aimed fireside chats to review priority ESG initiatives and topics, including on priority areas such as equitable access and climate action."
These fireside chats were broadcast publicly and aimed to provide investors the opportunity to learn more about Pfizers ESG priorities and activities.
"Environment Introduction Impact Stories Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report14 IntroductionOur Stakeholders Continued Colleagues We want all our colleagues to develop, grow, and succeed and believe everyone deserves to be seen, heard, and respected for who they are."
"We hold regular meetings and Town Hall events focused on employees and their needs, conduct regular surveys to understand colleague satisfaction and other aspects of corporate culture, and invest in programs to help colleagues manage their mental and physical well-being."
"Partners The scale of our ambition requires us to work in coordination and collaboration with external partners, so that we advance new breakthroughs, improve access to our medicines and vaccines, and nurture the growth of our business."
"We engage with foundations, multilaterals, non-governmental organizations, and coalitions, including groups like the World Health Organization, Save the Children, Access to Medicine Foundation, and Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)among otherson issues including access to medicines and vaccines, environmental concerns, transparency, and business ethics."
We also engage suppliers to understand their needs and support their efforts to reduce their environmental footprints.
"We work alongside global health and public health organizations to expand access to our medicines and vaccines, including on-the-ground support for health and education initiatives, and partner with academic and industry research alliances to help increase the number of future breakthroughs for patients."
"We also educate medical organizations about the latest research on our medicines and vaccines, our pipelines, and ways to access our products."
"Governments, policymakers, and regulators We engage policymakers and regulators to understand shifting external and regulatory landscapes to help ensure that issues facing our company and our commitment to breakthroughs that change patients lives are communicated."
"We have consistent, two-way dialogue with policymakers through targeted one-on- one engagement and through trade association and industry bodies alongside biopharmaceutical peers to help guide our medicines from the laboratory to patients."
We also provide policymakers with updates on our medicines and vaccines to facilitate decision-making and improved patient outcomes.
"Environment Introduction Impact Stories Social Governance Performance AppendixThe stories that follow highlight our extensive efforts in our priority areas, leading with our global work to help tackle the challenge of health inequity through the launch of An Accord for a Healthier World ."
"We also cover the work we do directly with patients, advocates, and caregivers to carry out our core purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients lives ."
Impact Stories Impact Stories Introduction Environment Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report16 Impact StoriesHealth inequity is one of the greatest and most urgent challenges we face today.
Half of the worlds population cannot access the healthcare they need.
"Significant improvements in local health systems are still needed in many lower-income countries to ensure broader and better access to care.1 Consistent with Pfizers responsibility to respect the right to health, we are always looking for new ways to tackle this challengenot only by working to assure consistent supply and access to medicines and vaccines, but also by addressing other system barriers that impede progress."
Thats why Pfizer launched An Accord for a Healthier World in 2022 to apply what we learned and catalyze a collective effort to help address the health equity gap.
"The Accord is a first-of-its kind, comprehensive initiative focused on helping increase access to medicines and vaccines for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries that have historically been most vulnerable to healthcare inequalities."
"Alongside governments and global health organizations, Pfizer aims to co-create scalable and sustainable solutions to help address systemic barriers to better health."
"The Accord is focused on working to find faster, more efficient pathways for supply of medicines and vaccines as well as strengthening the resources, capabilities, and platforms that will help enable sustainable access to those medicines."
"This includes technical expertise, training, diagnostic capacity, innovative financing, and more within the public health system."
We aim for the Accord to be a catalyst bringing together governments and multi-sector organizations to effectively identify and apply solutions across the entire healthcare ecosystem.
"No one government, organization, or company can close the health equity gap alone."
"At the launch of the Accord in May 2022, Pfizer initially committed to provide on a not-for-profit basis all our innovative medicines and vaccines available in the U."
S. or the European Union to 1.2 billion people in 45 lower-income countries.
"However, in the early months following the launch as Accord outreach began, the resounding feedback from governments was that access to a broader and more immediate scope of consistent, high-quality products is needed for meaningful and sustainable transformation."
"Based on this feedback and to better align with unmet patient needs, Pfizer made the decision to significantly expand the offering from the initial patented medicines and vaccines to the full portfolio of medicines for which Pfizer Tackling the Health Equity Gap Together Breaking down barriers with a new collective and holistic approach 1 https://www.who.int/news/item/13-12-2017-world-bank-and-who-half-the-world-lacks-access-to-essential-health-services-100-million-still-pushed-into-extreme-poverty-because-of-health-expenses#:~:text=At%20least%20half%20of%20 the,out%20of%20their%20own%20pockets Vaccine delivery in RwandaImpact Stories Introduction Environment Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report17 Impact Storieshas global rights."
The portfolio offered by Pfizer on a not-for-profit basis through the Accord expanded from 23 to hundreds of patented and off-patent products that help treat or prevent many of the greatest infectious and non-communicable disease threats faced today in lower- income countries.
Nearly 40 percent of the medicines and vaccines now offered are part of the World Health Organizations (WHO) list of essential medicines.
"As Pfizer introduces new medicines and vaccines, those products will also be included in the Accord portfolio."
The supply of these medicines and vaccines is only one step in getting them to people in need.
"Each country and community faces unique circumstances, so Pfizer will be working with the governments in each location to identify specific barriers and mobilize resources to address them."
"Since the launch of An Accord for a Healthier World, Pfizer has engaged with the majority of the 45 Accord-eligible lower-income countries and is in advanced conversations with a number of them to explore opportunities to address health equity."
Rwanda has already received its first deliveries of Pfizer medicines and vaccines under the Accord.
"In collaboration with the Rwandan Ministry of Health, Pfizer also provided professional healthcare education and training to support the use of these medicines and vaccines, and we have deployed the first Global Health Team to the country to help identify opportunities for long term supply chain optimization."
"Active collaboration is underway with the Ministries of Health in Malawi, Ghana, and Senegal as well as a number of other Accord-eligible lower-income countries to better understand the critical healthcare needs and opportunities for health system strengthening."
"Pfizer remains committed to helping support the needs of all patients, everywhere."
"Tackling the Health Equity Gap Together ContinuedImpact Stories Introduction Environment Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report18 Working in Partnership with Patient Advocacy Groups Day in and day out, colleagues across Pfizer collaborate with hundreds of Patient Advocacy Groups around the world to advance shared goals and better support the needs of patients everywhere."
"Advocacy leaders and patient groups understand the needs and perspectives of patients and, for this reason, are essential partners to leaders across the industry."
"By speaking directly with patients and advocates, Pfizer colleagues glean insights on patients experiences with their conditions and treatments, inform patients about clinical trials, discuss possible side effects, and educate the wider healthcare community about tools that might be helpful to patients."
Our Global Patient Advocacy team contributes to Pfizers advocacy and engagement strategy by supporting teams to drive deep therapeutic and regional relationship models with patient advocacy groups.
"With a patient engagement lead based in every region, the team works with patients and advocates regardless of geography, disease focus, or economic status."
"These partnerships can help improve patient outcomes by increasing patient engagement in research and development, elevating priority policy and social impact issues, creating meaningful resources and programs that provide value to patients, and more."
"For example, in 2022, Pfizer Spains Global Patient Advocacy colleagues joined forces with Global Patient Advocacy colleagues across Latin American Pfizer sites to organize the first joint webinar for Spanish-speaking advocates and patient groups titled Entre GENte y GENte, a play on words connoting between people and gene therapies."
"The webinar educated the audience about gene therapy and other new, advanced therapies available for rare disease patients and brought together experts, industry leaders, and over 100 patient advocacy groups for the first time."
"Patient representatives from Latin America and Spain participated, intending to work together between both continents through the exchange of information and concerns, and Pfizer leaders had the opportunity to reinforce the commitment to patient centricity and highlight the value of science."
"Events like these are multi-purpose: we are able to share knowledge and promote dialogue, increase literacy around advanced therapies for patient advocacy groups, and reinforce our longstanding commitment to listening to patients needs and challenges."
"Keeping Patients at the Center of Everything We Do Working directly with patients, advocates, and caregivers to deliver breakthroughs that change patients lives."
Patient Advocacy and Engagement Patient Centricity is our North Star at Pfizer.
"In keeping this steadfast focus, we know were best positioned to deliver on our purpose: developing breakthroughs that change patients lives."
"Thats what inspired us to host our first-ever Global Patient Advocacy Forum in 2022, bringing together senior advocacy leaders from around the world at our New York headquarters to discuss how to continue to best partner with and serve patients."
"The forum also set the stage for Pfizers upcoming Global Pan-Therapeutic Patient Centricity Advisors council, which will include advocates from Latin America, Europe, Asia, Canada, and the United States."
"The Global Pan-Therapeutic Patient Centricity Advisors council has been assembled to educate Pfizer colleagues on tr ends and issues patient groups face, provide candid input on key patient-focused programs and resources, and collaborate with Pfizer colleagues and senior leadership to co-develop meaningful approaches to measure progress on behalf of patients."
Impact StoriesWHAT IS PATIENT CENTRICITY?
"Pfizer set out to define patient centricity in 2022, working collaboratively with patient advocates to ensure our definition was inclusive of a diversity of experiences."
We surveyed colleagues as well as a group of global pan-therapeutic patient centricity advisors.
"We ulti - mately launched the definition as follows: Patient Centricity exists at Pfizer when we listen and learn from the patient perspective, acting as partners with accountability and integrity to deliver outcomes that matter most to patients and those involved in their care."
Pfizers first-ever Global Patient Advocacy Forum was held in 2022 bringing together patient advocacy leaders from around the world working across a wide variety of patient populations.
"Pfizer was recognized as the most patient-centric organization among the worlds largest pharma - ceutical companies, according to the 2021 PatientView Corporate Reputation of Pharma Survey."
"The survey, collecting insights from more than 2,150 patient groups across 90 countries, measures their perceptions of pharma companies across nine indicators, including transparency, patient safety, quality information, integrity, support for patients, and more."
"Impact Stories Introduction Environment Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report19 Patient Advocacy and Engagement Impact StoriesKeeping Patients at the Center of Everything We Do Continued Our Patient Centric Design Patient perspectives are embedded into all of our work end-to-end, from the earliest stages of research to the final approval and use of our medicines and vaccines."
Were not only considering their needs but also including them in the process.
"By working for and with patients, caregivers, and advocates directly, we are able to better understand and serve the evolving needs of patients everywhere."
"For example, in early 2022, patient advocacy leaders working across Pfizers Rare Disease team designed a survey with Qualtrics to collect insights from respondents with sickle cell disease and their caregivers to better understand the effects of sickle cell disease that matter most to the patient and preferences for treatment options."
"By bringing the patient voice in early, decision-makers at Pfizer develop a deep reservoir of insights about patients concerns and priorities, and in time, these can help inform therapeutic development, clinical trial design, as well as our support programs and services."
"As another demonstration of this approach, the Pfizer Germany Patient Dialog has gathered more than 100 patient organizations and leaders across the industry to discuss patients most pressing needs."
"Launched in 2002, the Dialog has transformed from a small networking event and workshop into a pivotal healthcare convention in Germany, uniting experts from the pharmaceutical industry, healthcare, politics, and patient advocacy organizations."
"The program includes a discussion about the future of the healthcare system, a debate about the opportunities presented by different therapies, and a best practices presentation on patient information."
These in-person gatherings offer important opportunities for co-creation.
"For example, the 2017 dialog led to the development of a Pfizer Germany website and information platform, the Support for Me Patient Navigator."
"Developed by advocates, healthcare professionals and other experts across the industry to cater to patients most pressing needs, the website now features insights from more than 70 external experts with advice on topics such as disease basics, insights on living with a particular condition, recommended examinations, and treatment, as well as support and guidance for caregivers and family members."
"PATIENT SPOTLIGHT: KEVINS STORY Diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD) at a young age, Kevin was determined to not let his diagnosis define his life."
"He now serves as a patient advocate, using his voice to help provide hope and reinforce that the future is brighter for those impacted by sickle cell disease."
"Because of their unique experience and insights into the realities patients face each day, patient advocates like Kevin are crucial partners in understanding and serving patient needs."
"After all, nobody understands a health condition better than the person experiencing it."
Collaborations like these are a priority across every therapeutic area and Pfizer could not deliver our purpose without advocates and patient groups.

"Impact Stories Introduction Environment Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report20 Patient Advocacy and Engagement Impact StoriesKeeping Patients at the Center of Everything We Do Continued Improving Health Literacy for All Patients Even the best programs, resources or health information cant help patients if they dont know how to act on it."
"Health literacy is the measure of how patients get health information and services, understand them, and use them."
"Many people find health information difficult or confusing, which can contribute to poor health decisions."
Thats why Pfizer is working with advocates to make health information easier to understand and to provide patients with resources to promote conversations that result in better outcomes.
"From ensuring that clinical trial data is accessible and useful to developing easy-to-understand product information and labels, Pfizer colleagues aim to ensure that all patient information is shared in plain language, without any technical jargon and in a timely manner."
"Pfizers Health Literacy Position Paper outlines various initiatives to improve health literacy, including our work with advocacy groups and non- profit partners."
"For example, in recent years, we worked with a number of organizationsincluding multicultural groups and community centersto evaluate the language around health topics, such as COVID-19, and to suggest phrasing that is easy to understand."
"In addition, Pfizer has sponsored organizations, such as the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) Roundtable on Health Literacy and Pharma Collaborative, to support the development of workshops around topics like communicating with vulnerable populations and developing health literacy skills to improve equity."
Weve also created two resources to support patients and caregivers this year.

Environment Impact Stories Introduction Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report24 Environment Continued EnvironmentSustainable Medicines Pfizer has a long history of using the concepts of green chemistry and promoting them across the industry.
Through scientific innovation we strive to design more efficient processes that can reduce the environmental impact of our medicines throughout the product life cycle.
"To expand on this, we are developing sustainable product design principles to transform the way we work across all modalities in both research and development."
"Our intent is to positively impact our environmental performance by systematically conserving energy, reducing water and raw materials usage, driving out waste, and embracing circular solutions where possible."
"The principles also serve to educate and inform our colleagues, define key metrics and performance targets, and encourage innovation through collaboration and partnerships."
"Pfizer is conducting representative life cycle assessments (LCAs) for small molecules, large molecules, vaccines, and devices."
"The output of these assessments is used to identify areas of focus in development and manufacturing processes, which can help enable preventative actions where we can have the most impact, with particular emphasis on GHG emissions reductions."
Pharmaceuticals in the Environment Pharmaceuticals in the environment and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continue to be critically important environmental issues for our industry.
"Pfizer is committed to limiting discharge of active pharmaceutical ingredients to wastewater from our manufacturing processes, using environmental risk assessment methodologies and emission control practices and technologies."
"As an active member, Pfizer follows the best practices in the AMR Industry Alliances (AMRIA) Antibiotic Manufacturing Standard, published in June 2022."
"We are on track to meet our goal of achieving the industry published targets (Predicted No Effect Concentrations) for antibiotics by 2025 and are piloting innovative wastewater management and treatment practices at several sites, including manufacturing and supplier sites, to advance our management of wastewater discharges."
In 2022 Pfizer participated in an effort led by AMRIA and BSI Standards Limited to develop an antibiotic certification scheme that is designed to demonstrate implementation of AMRIAs Antibiotic Manufacturing Standard through an independent third-party certification body.
Pfizer is one of the first companies to participate in the 2023 certification assessment pilot.
Waste Central to our sustainable medicines program is the minimization of waste across our sites globally.
"We pursue process improvements in our research, development and manufacturing operations through next-generation design projects and the implementation of green chemistry and other sustainability practices."
"Pfizer sites consistently seek opportunities to reduce, reuse, repurpose, and recycle materials such as packaging and plastics."
"For the past four years, weve tracked an internal performance metric to evaluate our sites waste management practices as they relate to the hierarchy of control of handling waste: avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle, dispose."
The metric is used to drive waste handling decisions to improve the circularity of our sites waste streams and promote minimization.
We are also able to use this metric to benchmark our performance against others in our industry and identify opportunities for improvement.
"Since 2019, we have reduced the quantity of waste sent to landfill by over 5.4 million kilograms."
Pfizer participates in the Pharmaceutical Product Stewardship Work Group (PPSWG) in the United States and MEDSdisposal in Europe to help enable proper disposal of unused medicines.
Environment Impact Stories Introduction Social Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report25 Environment Continued EnvironmentWater Stress The availability of and access to clean water is a basic human need globally and must be addressed locally.
"In 2022, Pfizer published a Water Stewardship position statement , which describes our commitment to being good stewards of the water we use to make medicines, particularly in water-stressed areas."
"To this end, we completed water risk assessments at all Pfizer sites in 2022 to better evaluate and understand water quality and scarcity issues across our network."
"As a result of these risk assessments, in 2023 we plan to develop action plans at sites with elevated risk scores, which include elements such as quantifying water use, implementing mitigation plans and establishing water conservation targets, protecting water quality, improving wastewater treatment where necessary, evaluating recycling practices, and engaging with surrounding communities."
"We will measure progress at our internal sites, while engaging with our key suppliers in water-stressed areas to encourage them to develop and implement similar action plans."
"Creating Sustainable Solutions in Memphis At Pfizers logistics center in Memphis, Tennessee, we took steps to reduce the environmental impact of cold chain shipping operations."
"Only about 3% of the single-use Styrofoam containers being used for cold chain shipments were being returned by our customers for recycling, with the majority being sent to landfill for disposal."
"We replaced the Styrofoam shippers with reus - able shipping containers that are easily returned and can be re-used over 70 times, reducing the amount of packaging waste sent to landfill by customers by 90%."

"Environment Social Impact Stories Introduction Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report27 SocialInnovation and Global HealthSocial As the global health landscape continues to evolve, so do we, making innovation our greatest tool as we uncover new combinations, designs, and advances to address an array of challenges."
"But medicinal solutions are only part of the equation: getting vaccines and therapies to patients who need them, regardless of location, requires innovation in delivery systems."
Pfizer focuses on both aspects of innovation by investing in the right people and partnerships.
Pfizer colleagues continue to break barriers in the discovery and delivery of treatments and solutions with a relentless focus on providing for underserved and vulnerable communities around the world.
Our strategic public and private partnerships allow for reach and scale when key players are brought together.
"Product Innovation At Pfizer, we measure ourselves by our relentless pursuit of breakthroughs that change patients lives."
This means prioritizing innovation and accelerating our efforts to bring solutions to those who need them at lightspeed.
We have been consistently investing in innovation with a research and development budget that has grown by more than 70 percent in less than five years.
"As of January 31, 2023, our current pipeline of 110 programs in development, from Phase 1 through registration, reflects our empowerment of scientists, culture of excellence, and deep- seated drive to deliver on our purpose for patients."
A greater success rate means the potential to affect more patients lives.
"By the end of 2022, Pfizer achieved an end-to-end success rate of 18 percentfrom first-in- human (FIH) to approval at a new molecular entity (NME) level which is nearly 10 times our 2010 performance."
This improved success rate can be largely attributed to a years-long narrowing of our therapeutic focus areas to where we believe we are equipped to make the biggest impact on patients lives.
"Reduced cycle times, while continuing our focus on safety and quality, can help get our breakthroughs to patients faster, potentially addressing more unmet needs."
Pfizer reduced our median FIH to approval cycle time for new medicines and vaccines from nine years in 2019 to approximately five years in 2022.
"Based on an evolving mix of approvals, including accelerated development for COVID-19 products, Pfizer now develops medicines and vaccines 45 percent faster from FIH to approval compared to 2019."
We work every day to upend the standard approach to clinical development in areas with a high unmet need in order to pursue breakthroughs in vaccines and treatments.
Pfizers NME and Biologics License Application (BLA) approvals reflect a greater proportion of Breakthrough Therapy and Expedited Regulatory Designations relative to the industry.
"Between 2018 and 2022, 44 percent of Pfizer NME and novel BLA applications approved by the U."
"S. FDA were designated as Breakthrough Therapies compared to 30 percent of industry Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) vaccine applications approved over the same period Including other FDA designations involving expedited review between 2018 and 2022, 100 percent of Pfizer NME and novel BLA applications approved by the FDA achieved one (or more) expedited designations compared to 67 percent of industry CDER and CBER vaccine applicationsDigital Innovation Greater social impact is the result of our re - lentless focus on productivity, as we get more life-changing medicines into the hands of pa - tients and at a faster rate."
"Pfizer is leveraging digital, data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning to accelerate innovation in the interests of patients at every stepfrom discovery to clinical development, manufac - turing, distribution, and commercialization."
"Technology enhancements like computation - al modeling and simulation, and quantum computing capabilities, are making our crit - ical work faster and more relevant to actual patient experiences."
"In 2022, our digital innovation included partnering with major retail pharmacy chains to introduce digital health products that support patients on their treatment journey, and applying advanced analytics and AI ca - pabilities that accelerate access to PAXLOVID, Pfizers COVID-19 oral treatment."
Pfizer also launched an AI-driven program to monitor and identify counterfeit versions of Pfizer medicines in real-time to help ensure patient access to safe and effective medications.
"To deliver these and other innovations at speed and scale, we accelerated the migration of our global IT footprint to the cloud from 25 percent in 2019 to 80 percent in 2022.Environment Social Impact Stories Introduction Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report28 Social Continued Social Our Innovations Are Guided by Patient Needs RSV vaccine candidate In 2022, Pfizer received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for our respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate, RSVpreF, for prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness in both infants, through maternal immunization, and older adults aged 60+."
"With RSVs potentially serious and in some cases life-threatening impacts, RSVpreF has the potential to be the first maternal vaccine candidate to help protect infants from birth through six months of age, if approved."
"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Pfizer received approval from the European Medicines Agency in 2022 for APEXXNAR [pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (20-valent, adsorbed)], our 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in people ages 18 and up."

"In the trial, etrasimod showed an encouraging balance of efficacy and safety, and could have a meaningful impact for patients, if approved."
"Type 2 diabetes Rising rates of obesity and diabetes carry significant health consequences, as these diseases have increased comorbidity risk."
Pfizers investigational oral GLP-1receptor agonists are designed to address what we understand to be key drivers of these diseases and are showing best-in-class potential.
"While ensuring the compliance with our high-quality standards and keeping patient safety at the forefront, we are working to accelerate clinical development timelines for these treatment candidates and, subject to clinical success and approval of regulatory authorities, we hope to be able to provide a convenient oral option for patients alongside currently approved injectable medicines."
Oncology Oncology continues to be another therapeutic area where Pfizer has deep scientific and biologic understanding.
"In 2022, Pfizers investigational cancer immunotherapy, elranatamab, received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of people with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, representing our twelfth breakthrough designation in oncology To help patients with advanced prostate cancerthe second most common type of cancer in menPfizer is conducting the Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 study, examining a combination treatment with TALZENNA (talazoparib), an oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor, and XTANDI (enzalutamide)an existing standard of care."
"The study showed positive results with the potential for this combination to become a new standard of care for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, subject to regulatory approval."
"Environment Social Impact Stories Introduction Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report29 Innovating for Impact 2022 also brought significant launches and expansions that provide opportunities for Pfizer to further address unmet patient needs in categories such as rare hematology, for example."
"Pfizer completed the acquisition of Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development, and delivery of life-changing treatments for underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease."
"A core pillar of our product innovation work is our effort to help slow the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) one of the biggest threats to global health as it can make infections harder to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death."
As many as 10 million people could die annually from AMR by 2050.
"Pfizers recognition in the 2022 Access to Medicine AMR Benchmark reflects our industry-leading and multi-faceted approach to combat AMR, which includes our own product pipeline, active stewardship, infrastructure investments, and comprehensive tracking."
"Pfizers ATLAS surveillance programone of the largest in the worldprovides public access to both antifungal and antibiotic resistance data, helping researchers and stakeholders better understand resistance patterns."
"Equitable Access and Pricing At Pfizer, we measure ourselves not just by the creation of breakthrough medicines and vaccines, but by the accessibility of those critical innovations within populations in need."
Our vaccines and medicines are not able to benefit patients if they cannot reach or afford them.
"To change patients lives, Pfizer applies a modernized approach to access, focused on affordability and delivery for patients with the greatest coverage gaps and out-of-pocket exposure."
"As a result of these efforts, in 2022, more than 1.3 billion patients were treated and / or vaccinated by a Pfizer product, including COMIRNATY (the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) and PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets).1 Affordability is a long term commitment and must be embedded in our systems, incentives, and operating model."
"At Pfizer, this is guided by An Accord for a Healthier World , which is focused on closing the health equity gap that persists between wealthy nations and many lower- income countries."
"Alongside governments and multi-sector partners, Pfizer is working to co-create scalable, sustainable solutions to enable greater access to healthcare innovation for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries around the world."
"Additionally, Pfizers broad-based core methods to reduce the number of people who cannot afford our medicines include: Advocating with payers, governments, and others in the healthcare system on behalf of patients to identify and relieve financial burdens Patient assistance and donation programs when insurance or reimbursement systems fail to provide affordable access to our medicines Innovative financing mechanisms, including differential pricing, microfinancing, peer-to-peer lending, subscription models, and flexible payment options, to help reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients on a sustained basis New technologies that reduce barriers to care and digital wallets with the potential to pass rebates directly to patients at the point of sale We also engage in global commercial access partnerships with organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, where weve agreed to supply up to 930 million doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) through 2027 at its lowest access price."

"Based on Pfizers experience working with Ministries of Health and multilateral organizations during this unprecedented scale up of a vaccination campaign, we recognize countries are facing multiple issues when it comes to supply planning and delivery, including the ability to absorb vaccine in the country, lower uptake rates due to hesitancy, limited ultra-cold-chain capacity or infrastructure to properly move or store vaccines, syringe supply, and other downstream capacity issues like workforce constraints."
Continued investment in readiness efforts in many low-income countries is still necessary to ensure that vaccines shipped effectively reach populations.
"Pfizer continues to partner with the global health community, governments, and private industry to help address these challenges."
"Local Supply Chain Partnerships Environment Social Impact Stories Introduction Governance Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report32 Social Continued SocialAs part of a four-year partnership with Zipline, Pfizer is continuing to support an innovative pilot initiative in Ghana, focused on delivering vaccines that require cold-chain storage to hard-to-reach areas using drones."
The initial success of the project suggests the program could be expanded to deliver doses of COVID-19 vaccines to remote regions across the world where Zipline operates.
"In 2022, over 1.7 million vaccine doses from various manufacturers were delivered by Zipline, reaching 657 health facilities across Ghana, as well as expanding to Nigeria, reaching 90 rural health facilities in Kaduna State."
"In addition to providing much-needed vaccines to these areas, the delivery of these 1.7 million doses by drones saved over 34,000 gallons of gasoline."
"In 2021, Pfizer signed a memorandum of understanding with the Global Environment and Technology Foundation to collaborate with Project Last Mile."
"The partnership is focused on aligning the supply chain expertise and technical capabilities of Coca-Cola, a company whose supply chain is characterized as one of the widest reaching in the world, with technical expertise from Pfizer on vaccine handling, storage and administration in order to improve the availability of vaccines in developing countries, and, in particular, to those residing in and around the last mile of the medical supply chain in Africa."
Zipline Project Last Mile Patient Centric Design Everything we do at Pfizer is done first and foremost with patients in mind.
"To be most effective in serving patients and understanding the patient experience, we are intentional about engaging them, along with caregivers and advocacy groups, in all of our processes."
"By speaking directly with patients and advocates, we glean insights on conditions and treatments, inform patients about clinical trials, discuss possible side effects, and educate the wider healthcare community about helpful tools."
"In that spirit, we hosted our second annual Patients in Focus week, engaging more than 40,000 colleagues and more than 200 Global Patient Advocacy Partners."
"From blood drives and volunteering campaigns to patient chats and colleague lunch-and-learns, in-person and virtual events expanded colleagues understanding of patient needs and highlighted best-in-class patient advocacy initiatives."
"In addition to improving the broader patient experience through community engagement, health inequities are addressed more effectively when community experts are intentionally engaged in developing solutions that tackle underlying issues."
Pfizer continues to work with key groups across the U.
S. to help address health disparities among historically underserved populations through its Multicultural Health Equity Collective (The Collective).
"Building upon trust established with partner organizations, The Collective continues to move beyond education and health literacy efforts, while purposefully focusing on systemic issues that cause inequitable health outcomes."
"In 2022, The Collective hosted its inaugural Health Equity in Action Summit: Optimal Interventions to Systemic Drivers of Racial Health Inequities."
"Co-convened by The Century Foundation, the National Minority Quality Forum, Morehouse School of Medicine, and National Association of County & City Health Officials (NACCHO), the Summit gathered more than 100 leaders from across the healthcare ecosystem to challenge conventional thinking, highlight the need and opportunities to disrupt racism embedded in health systems, and make better health possible for all."
"We explored solutions to advance health equity across key areas, including digital health, healthcare facilities and delivery, workforce development, health research and policy, and more."
We look forward to partnering with Summit participants to elevate solutions that address critical gaps in equitable healthcare and reduce barriers to quality care.

"We have similarly high standards for all materials used by third parties in clinical and commercial manufacturing, including initial supplier qualification prior to use in manufacturing and incoming inspection on a routine basis."
Pfizer monitors the performance of and regularly audits our direct suppliers.
Audit outcomes are used to drive continuous improvement in both performance and compliance.
"Due to the strategic importance of Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) and Contract Research Organizations (CROs), Pfizer has dedicated teams to maintain the necessary policies and effectively identify and mitigate risks."
"Audits and inspections As part of our independent audit program, we regularly assess the effectiveness of our QMS."
"Pfizers internal audit processes are conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, standards, guidelines (e.g., ISO & ICH) and governing GxPs, to ensure patient safety, product quality, and applicable licenses and certifications are maintained."
"The audit program spans preclinical, clinical, pharmacovigilance, regulatory, medical, manufacturing and logistics, suppliers, and post-launch activities."
The program also covers regulated processes and information technology controls.
Our audits are designed to provide assurance that we are compliant with regulatory requirements worldwide and that we proactively identify and remediate risks to compliance.
"We also routinely undergo GMP, GCP, and pharmacovigilance (PV) inspections from regulatory agencies worldwide."
"Continuous Improvement (CI) At Pfizer we pursue innovation and continuous improvement in our work, and CI initiatives are a cornerstone of Pfizers business divisions across the enterprise."
"Recent examples of CI initiatives include: Enhanced management of Pfizers quality, safety, and audit data Increased efficiency and effectiveness of Pfizers quality lab practices and safety systems Increased use of advanced analytics in Pfizers Manufacturing and Supply Chain networks Pfizers Integrated Manufacturing Excellence (IMEx) program drives continuous improvement across the entire supply network, standardizing a one best way of working focused on consistent work and increased effectiveness."
"Under this program, all colleagues have a voice and receive required support when needed."

"To protect our patients, we take a proactive approach to product safety by investing in an enterprise-wide, global strategy to combat counterfeit threats through patient education, legislative advocacy, surveillance, and interdiction1."
"Additionally, we are building a coalition with healthcare providers and associations, policy leaders, regulatory agencies, distributors, insurers, pharmacies, patient advocacy groups, and other pharmaceutical companies to combat the risk counterfeits pose to the health of our communities."
Pfizer routinely provides training to policy makers and law enforcement to better identify counterfeit medicines and discourage counterfeiting.
"In 2022, we launched the No Fakes for Health Sake education and awareness campaign, which aims to raise greater awareness about the dangers of counterfeits among patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, policy leaders, and government agencies."
Our Counterfeit Medicines: A Serious Threat to Patient Safety toolkit provides robust resources for U.
S.
Attorneys General and lawmakers ready to engage and to join the fight against counterfeits.
"For additional resources on how to safely buy online, please visit Pfizer.com/Counterfeits."
"In addition to our traditional anti-counterfeit efforts, Pfizer addresses illicit online prescription drug offers through advanced internet monitoring and disruption programs."
We search and systematically disrupt online pharmacy and social media groups dispensing counterfeit versions of Pfizer medicines and vaccines with enhanced digital tools that keep pace with the sophisticated and rapidly evolving tactics employed by counterfeiters to target patients.
"If a counterfeit product is identified in the legitimate supply chain, a formal process is in place to alert the appropriate authorities and relevant trading partners."
"Additionally, we collaborate with distributors and repackagers to monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance."
"Pfizer evaluates and invests in the latest packaging and information technologies to align with global serialization regulations and challenges associated with counterfeiting, theft, and diversion."
"The unique Product Identifiers developed for serialization will enable the tracking and tracing of product movement through the supply chain, from the manufacturing site to patient dispensation (including Government Systems and Trading Partners) and allows authorized trading partners today to verify the authenticity of our medicines with a simple scan."
Supply Chain Transparency We set high standards for our internal and external partners guided by robust governance processes to help ensure responsible supply chain management.
This helps ensure the safety and quality of everything we produce and aligns with our core value of equity.
We see compliance with regulatory standards as the foundation of risk mitigation and a crucial component of providing the world with a reliable supply of safe and effective medicines and vaccines.
"Our regular evaluation of these stakeholders extends to assessing environmental, health, safety, and sustainability performance, including labor and human rights reviews."
"Our collaborations with our suppliers are focused on improving sustainability, compliance with laws, and alignment to our Supplier Conduct Principles and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management."
We act on these engagements and reviews by working together to improve operational efficiency and impact reductions.
These reviews are also conducted through a human rights lens.
Pfizer maintains a focused Modern Slavery program as described in our Modern Slavery Statement which outlines our management approach in our supply chain and our operations.
"Pfizer is currently focusing on targeted high-risk areas as identified by the Global Slavery Index and is taking steps to address these risks as described in our Statement, including implementation of our corporate labor and human rights standard."
"If we identify these higher risk areas, our process outlines additional due diligence processes to be implemented to help avoid being complicit in supporting modern slavery."
"Through a combination of remote and on-site audits we assessed EHS performance for 116 supplier facilities in 2022, resulting in 921 observations."
"Of the suppliers audited, 2 were identified as not meeting Pfizers expectations for EHS performance, resulting in Pfizer not pursuing business with those suppliers."
"We require our suppliers to develop action plans in response to our audits and implement improved controls, as needed."
"1 In this context, interdiction refers to the seizure, raids, and arrests to prevent counterfeits from reaching their targeted audience."
Social Governance Environment Impact Stories Introduction Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report44 GovernanceGovernance Continued Intellectual Property Pfizers ability to drive science forward and deliver breakthroughs that change patients lives is fueled by the protections provided by the intellectual property system.
These protections are the incentive that turns ideas into reality and contributes to a thriving society and global economic development.
"We are committed to the responsible use of our intellectual property, as reflected in the IP Principles for Advancing Cures and Therapies (IP PACT)."
"We recognize the unique socioeconomic challenges facing Least Developed Countries, as defined by the United Nations Committee for Development Policy, and have a policy of patent nonenforcement in those countries."
"With regards to Pfizers efforts to expand access to our oral COVID-19 treatment, our voluntary licensing agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), a United Nations-backed public health organization, is intended to help facilitate the production and supply of generic versions of our oral COVID-19 treatment to the most vulnerable populations."
"We believe that accessible patent information promotes scientific progress and helps improve the procurement of medicines; in line with this belief, we are a member of the Patent Information Initiative for Medicines (Pat-INFORMED), an initiative hosted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) that facilitates access to medicine patent information."
"As a founding member of the WIPO Re:Search public- private partnership, were proud of the impact this 11-year collaboration, which came to a close at the end of 2022, has had in the fight against neglected tropical diseases."
"Additionally, the 2022 Access to Medicine Index recognized Pfizer as performing above average in terms of sharing IP assets with third-party researchers."
"We are also a sponsor of the Inventor Assistance Program, a WIPO initiative in cooperation with the World Economic Forum that matches developing country inventors and small businesses of limited financial means with patent attorneys that provide pro bono legal assistance to secure patent protection."
Clinical Trials Our work in clinical trials is fundamental to achieving our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients lives.
"Patient health and safety is at the heart of this including how we design, run, and communicate our clinical trial research."
"Our conduct is guided with the help and oversight of a variety of groups, including patient groups, institutional review boards, regulatory authorities, data and safety monitoring boards, medical and industry association guidelines governing ethical clinical trial conduct and research integrity, and our own Bioethics Advisory Council."
"In keeping with our core value of equity, our teams continue to find new ways to remove barriers to trial participation, such as identifying clinical trial sites that offer mobile site options and implementing protocols that permit at-home follow-ups, where possible."
"By meeting potential participants where they are, were able to offer flexibility, increasing participation among those who may have not participated otherwise and accelerate development so we can bring more potential breakthroughs to more patients faster."
"We have that same mindset for increasing awareness, using the internet and social media to share educational information about our trials."
"Recognizing that language can also be a barrier to participation, in 2022 we launched Pfizer Estudios Clinicos, a searchable, Spanish- language website about Pfizer clinical trials."
"All Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies respect human rights and patient privacy and are conducted in accordance with our high ethical standards, applicable laws and regulations, and principles derived from relevant international standards, including: The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E6 guideline for Good Clinical Practice PhRMAs Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials and Communication of Clinical Trial Results The Declaration of Helsinki The United States Belmont report More information on Pfizer policies related to clinical trials can be found on our research integrity and transparency page at Pfizer.com You can learn more about our clinical trial work at Pfizer.com/ ClinicalTrials and by searching Pfizer on ClinicalTrials.gov ."
DIVERSITY IN CLINICAL TRIALS Pfizer has made a commitment to conducting clinical trials with populations that reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the communities that we serve.
Pfizer continues to take decisive steps to improve diversity in our trials and share our insights with others.
"In 2022, Pfizer published a whitepaper on the role of pharmacology in improving diversity in clinical trials."
We recognize that different people may respond to our medicines and vaccines differently and including these groups in our trials would allow for enhanced understanding of a study medicine.
"Social Governance Environment Impact Stories Introduction Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report45 Data Privacy and Protection We are committed to the responsible, transparent, and secure use of personal data entrusted to us by patients, customers, employees, and others."
"Our privacy practices are governed by our Global Privacy Committee, a cross-functional governance body composed of senior-level leaders who provide oversight and guidance that informs company practices."
"Additionally, our Global Privacy Office maintains an enterprise-wide policy and standards that guide the collection, maintenance, and protection of personal data and consider the legal and regulatory requirements where we do business."
We also mandate regular employee and contractor training on global privacy principles in accordance with our commitment to respect and safeguard personal data.
We do all of this to help ensure that we are respecting the right to privacy of individuals and responsibly collecting and managing the data we collect.
"In 2022, we developed a set of Privacy Principles outlining our view of the appropriate uses of personal health data and what we do to help ensure safeguards are in place to protect what has been entrusted to us."
Human Rights and the Right to Health Pfizer is committed to conducting business in an ethical and responsible manner.
This includes respecting internationally recognized human rights throughout our operations.
"Our responsibility to respect human rights extends throughout our operations from lab to patient, including our diverse global supply chain of numerous local and global third-party vendors."
"In line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Pfizers Human Rights Policy Statement focuses on addressing risks that could have the most severe impact on people: our patients, our colleagues, the workers of our business partners, and the communities in which we operate."
We also seek to prioritize the individuals and groups who may be most vulnerable to impacts.
"True to our efforts to continually monitor and address risks and impacts on people, we are currently updating Pfizers human rights policy statement to reflect the evolving landscape for human rightsprogressing our responsibility to address the salient human rights issues for our business."
"Throughout 2022 and looking forward, we have continued to focus on the right to health as our most salient issue, with availability, accessibility, and affordability as key focus areas."
Other salient human rights are the principle of non- discrimination; the right to privacy; freedom from slavery and forced labor and other abuses; the right to enjoy just and favorable working conditions; the right to a safe workplace; and the right to a healthy environment.

GovernanceGovernance Continued Social Governance Environment Impact Stories Introduction Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report46 GovernanceGovernance Continued Accountability Right Incentives We aspire to drive positive social and environmental change in our role as a responsible corporate citizen.
This commit- ment fundamentally informs how we fulfill our purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients lives.
Our ESG strategy is designed by leadership to leverage compensation as a key motivator to hold ourselves accountable.
"For the 2022 perfor- mance year, the Compensation Committee of the Board lever- aged the ESG Scorecard, which included three selected social and environmental key performance indicators (KPIs)."
"Those ESG Scorecard KPIs, listed below, were factors in determining the funding of our annual short-term incentive plan (Global Performance Plan [GPP] program) for over 30,000 global col- leagues and leaders."
"The three ESG metrics selected by the Compensation Com- mittee, in relation to the 2022 GPP program, are consistent with key guiding principles and aligned with our strategy."
"Additionally, these KPIs are objectively measurable."
"We believe these ESG Scorecard KPIs(i) percentage of Vice President and higher roles held by women (globally), (ii) percentage of Vice President and higher roles held by minorities (U."
"S.), and (iii) Greenhouse Gas Emissionsare holistic drivers of our future success as a company."
"The goals set for 2022, as part of the GPP program, were also based on our publicly announced longer term goals in these areas."
"We will continue this approach for the 2023 performance year, as well."
Incorporating ESG into our executive compensation program amplifies our commitment to long term value cre- ation and sustainability.
"For additional details on the GPP Program, refer to the Pfizer 2023 Proxy Statement."
Political Contributions and Lobbying Activities We understand the impact public policy has on our ability to meet patient needs and provide value to our shareholders.
"As such, we actively participate in dialogue around public policy with lawmakers to advocate and educate, in addition to explaining our perspectives."
"We believe the business community has a responsibility to transparently engage in this space, given our extensive knowledge, research, and societal impact."
Pfizer is a member of various industry and trade groups that represent both the pharmaceutical industry and the business community at large to bring about consensus on broad policy.
"In addition to trade group positions on healthcare policy issues, we realize these organizations may engage in a broad range of other issues that extend beyond the scope of what is of primary importance to Pfizers business."
"If concerns arise about a particular issue, we convey our concerns, as appropriate."
"We believe there is value in making sure our positions on issues important to patients, Pfizer, and our industry are communicated and understood within those organizations."
"In December 2021, Pfizer issued a report outlining the public policy positions of Pfizer and five trade associations across six areas of key public policy and ESG significance for Pfizer."
The report also compares Pfizer and the trade associations positions and describes the degree of alignment and areas of misalignment.
"Pfizer will update this report periodically, as needed."
"Pfizers corporate political contributions and lobbying activities are focused on promoting the interests of the patients we serve and our company, without regard to the personal political preferences or affiliations of any of our employees, officers, or board members."
"The companys corporate political contributions and lobbying activities are subject to robust internal procedures designed to align these efforts with our public policy priorities, applicable law, and patient-centric agenda."
The company has an extensive training and reporting program in place designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as Pfizers internal standards.
Social Governance Environment Impact Stories Introduction Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report47 Governance Continued Board of Directors and Board Committees The Board of Directors is elected annually by the shareholders.
The primary responsibility of the Board is to represent shareholders and to enhance long term shareholder value.
The Board elects the chief executive officer and other members of the senior management team and acts as an advisor and counselor to senior management and ultimately monitors its performance.
The function of the Board to monitor the performance of senior management is facilitated by the presence of a majority of independent non-employee Directors who have substantive knowledge of the companys business.
The Board has determined that all of our current Directors (other than Dr. Albert Bourla) are independent.
Pfizers Board Committees are integral to the overall functioning of the Board.
"The Board has six committees: Audit Committee Compensation Committee Executive Committee Governance & Sustainability Committee Regulatory and Compliance Committee Science and Technology Committee Board Leadership Structure In December 2022, following a thorough review by the Governance & Sustainability Committee, the independent Directors re-evaluated the Boards leadership structure and considered the companys current operating environment, peers Board leadership structures, best practices, as well as investor feedback."
"The Committee, along with the other independent Directors, determined that continuing to combine the roles of Chairman and CEO would be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders."
"The company can more effectively execute its strategies with a Chair who has deep scientific and industry expertise, along with extensive company knowledge."
"The combined role, coupled with the strong Lead Independent Director, has enabled the Board to be responsive to challenges and opportunities as they continue to arise."
"Governance of ESG Our ESG efforts underscore our commitment to achieving our purpose delivering breakthroughs that change patients livesand supporting the communities in which we live and work through ethical decision-making and our core values: courage, excellence, equity, and joy."
"Values-based decision making promotes accountability and helps ensure that integrity, quality, safety, and ethics are foundational to all we do."
"Pfizers robust governance of ESG priorities aligned with our enterprise strategyis critical to help enable impact, innovation, and reporting."
"The ESG function within Pfizer and its cross-functional governing committees (at the senior management and the executive level) have responsibility for considering and adopting potential goals and targets, with escalation to the Governance & Sustainability Committee (G&SC) of the Board, based on input from experienced subject matter experts and advisors."
"Our cross-functional Sustainability Steering Committee, chaired by our Chief Sustainability Officer, advises on key issues and guides the integration and implementation of Pfizers non-financial reporting related to ESG."
"This Committee is overseen by a dedicated Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the Executive Leadership Team member leading Corporate Affairs, who reports directly to the Chairman and CEO."
"Our ESG governance has as its foundation oversight by the Board of Directors, commitment and accountability by leadership, and engagement by colleagues across the company."
Diverse perspectives from internal and external stakeholders inform our ESG strategy and priorities.
The Board of Directors is fully engaged and supportive of Pfizers ESG program.
The G&SC of the Board is primarily responsible for oversight of our ESG strategy and reporting.
"In addition, the G&SC is responsible for considering risks relating to the companys lobbying priorities and activities and political spending, and the companys policies and practices related to its human capital management, which may include culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, pay equity, and talent management."
"Throughout the year, the G&SC receives updates from company leaders regarding our ESG priorities and progress and changes in the ESG external environment."
Other Board Committees oversee elements of our ESG program associated with their respective areas of responsibility.
"For example: The Audit Committee, which has primary responsibility for overseeing Pfizers Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, reviews and receives briefings concerning risks to Pfizer associated with certain priority issues (for example, information security and technology, cybersecurity, drug pricing, access, and reimbursement) and company culture (compliance related concerns, workplace behavior, and harassment and retaliation)."
ERM provides a framework for risk identification and management which includes risks associated with ESG factors.
The Audit Committee is also monitoring potential mandatory sustainability reporting under consideration by regulators.
"The Compensation Committee has responsibility for the executive compensation program, which includes approving the compensation of our executive officers, overseeing executive diversity, pay equity, inclusion, recruiting, retention, career development and succession planning (in collaboration with the Governance & Sustainability Committee)."
"Effective for the 2022 performance year, the Compensation Committee adopted the ESG Scorecard to tie the funding of our annual short-term incentive plan for over 30,000 global colleagues and leaders, in part, to select social and environmental key performance indicators GovernanceThe committees charters may be viewed on our corporate website at: Board Committee Charters Social Governance Environment Impact Stories Introduction Performance AppendixPfizer 2022 ESG Report48 GovernanceGovernance Continued Shareholders and other interested parties may communicate with any of our directors, including the Lead Independent Director and the Audit Committee Chair, as follows: By email: https://investors.pfizer.com/Investors/Corporate-Governance/Contact-Our-Directors/default.aspx By mail: 66 Hudson Boulevard East New York, NY 10001-2192 (KPIs)."
"In addition, the overarching ESG factors, including the three metrics used in the ESG Scorecard for the short- term annual incentive plan, may also be included in the individual performance goals of executives throughout the organization, which will further align their compensation with ESG factors."
See Pfizers 2023 Proxy Statement for further details on the executive compensation program.
"The Regulatory and Compliance Committee oversees the compliance program, ethics and integrity, product quality and safety, the compliance governance framework, and risk management, in addition to overseeing healthcare-related regulatory and compliance risks in connection with the development, manufacture and marketing of products, and risk mitigation efforts."
We encourage all colleagues to contribute to achieving our ESG goals by understanding our strategy and to apply an ESG lens to their day-to-day activities.
We integrate ESG by partnering closely with colleagues in our priority areas to establish ESG goals and define action plans to achieve those goals.
"Board Diversity and Independence Our Board is composed entirely of independent directors other than our Chairman and CEO, Albert Bourla, and is diverse, with diversity reflecting gender, age, race, ethnicity, background, professional experience, and perspectives."
"Each Director provides a unique perspective, experience, and skill set, which creates an effective and well-functioning Board."
"To help ensure effective refreshment and proactively manage eventual vacancies on the Board, the Governance & Sustainability Committee and the full Board consider a diverse pool of qualified director candidates on an ongoing basis."
"This process resulted in the election of five new independent directors over the past five years, bringing our average Board tenure to seven years.4 62 7Social Governance Environment Impact Stories Introduction Performance AppendixMeasuring and reporting our ESG performance is key to understanding the impact of our operations, driving continuous improvement, and maintaining a transparent dialogue with our stakeholders."
We are committed to improving our ESG performance because it is crucial to our long term success as a responsible business and is essential to achieving our purpose.
The key performance indicators we track are driven by an assessment of issues of greatest relevance and impact to our stakeholders and our business.

"New molecular entities (NME) are the foundation of Pfizers, and the industrys, innovative medicines pipelines."
NMEs originating outside of Pfizer and acquired or licensed by Pfizer after achieving FIH or more advanced development milestones are generally excluded from FIH-approval cycle time calculations where substantial development effort occurred before Pfizers operational control.
"Cycle times from FIH to approval are calculated between the FIH date for the NME in its first indication pursued, and first major regulatory approval (U."
S. FDA or EU European Medicines Agency) for the NME.
The NME approval may or may not be for the same indication by which the NME triggered its first FIH milestone.
Rolling cohorts are used to provide sufficient sample sizes to calculate cycle times between major development milestones.
The FIH to approval NME success rate metric is a composite metric.
It is a cumulative success rate derived using individual phase success rates from FIH (start of Phase 1) to approval (first regulatory approval) at an NME level.
"Combinations of approved NMEs, biosimilars and generics are excluded from all success rate calculations."
"Cumulative NME success rate is calculated using three-year rolling cohorts for Phase 1 and five-year rolling cohorts for Phase 2, Phase 3 and registration."

"In accordance with the Use of Proceeds defined on pages S-6 and S-7 of the Prospectus Supplement dated March 25, 2020, the proceeds were allocated to new projects and projects that had received funding in the three years prior to the issuance of the March 2020 Sustainability Bond as follows: (1) to help manage our environmental impact by supporting more environmentally efficient design and the construction of new office and manufacturing facilities, (2) to support increased patient access to Pfizers medicines and vaccines, especially among underserved populations, and (3) to help strengthen healthcare systems."
"As of December 31, 2022, the net proceeds of approximately $1.24 billion from the March 2020 Sustainability Bond were fully allocated, funding a portion of the aggregate spend of $1.275 billion."
A breakdown of the specific allocation of funds can be found in the table below.

Design priorities included integration of systems and technologies to increase energy efficiency and enable effective energy demand management.
The design was informed through identification of the largest energy consuming systems and processes enabling evaluation of opportunities for reduction of electrical and thermal loads.
"This analysis included use of benchmarking studies to identify good practices, including incorporation of a comprehensive metering infrastructure facilitating early investigation and action of energy demand changes."
The project was issued a Green Mark Gold Certificate by the Singapore Building and Construction Authority in December 2022 and is on track for completion in 2023.
"NYHQ Transformation - 66 Hudson: Proceeds were also used to advance sustainable design principles in Pfizers new corporate headquarters in Hudson Yards, New York City."
This new Pfizer facility was designed to meet or exceed the Gold level of two independent certification standards including the US Green Building Counsel (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDv4) standard and the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI) WELLv2 Pilot Standard and is currently undergoing certification review.
"The design includes maximizing the use of natural lighting, reducing lighting power demand 30% below the LEEDv4 baseline, water use management through incorporation of low flow plumbing fixtures, and enabling effective energy management through installation of advanced energy metering and energy performance modeling."
"Based on this energy performance modeling, we are forecasting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of around 70% compared with emissions levels in 2019 at our previous headquarters location."
This forecast is based on design efficiencies in space utilization and energy reduction strategies.
Colleagues began working from the new Hudson Yards facility at the end of 2022.
Sayana Press Filing Line: An estimated 190 million women of reproductive age worldwide would like to delay or prevent pregnancy but are not using any method of contraception.
"Pfizer Inc. and a consortium of partners are part of a public-private collaboration to broaden access to Sayana Press, Pfizers long-acting, injectable, and reversible contraceptive."
"In total, Pfizer allocated $41 million from our Sustainability Bond proceeds to fund the capital expense of establishing a new automated filling line for the Uniject injection system, which delivers the contraceptive."
"Once operational, this new filling line will allow for capacity to scale from 23 million units per year, to up to 30 million units per year."
"In 2023, the new automated filling line will undergo process validation and EU regulatory review and is expected to enter into commercial production."
"Pfizer Foundation: Proceeds from the March 2020 Sustainability Bond are being used to support the companys work to increase access to Pfizers medicines and vaccines, especially among underserved communities, and strengthen healthcare systems."
"Pfizer has allocated $280 million of the Sustainability Bond proceeds to The Pfizer Foundation, a charitable organization established by Pfizer Inc., that works to help address the challenges of a complex and evolving global health landscape."
The Pfizer Foundation is a separate legal entity from Pfizer Inc. with distinct legal restrictions.
The Pfizer Foundation is focused on accelerating innovative solutions and improving health systems to help improve the health of communities around the world.
"Through its programs, The Foundation aims to help reduce the impact of infectious disease and improve access to healthcare for underserved patients around the world."
"AMR Fund: In 2020, Pfizer pledged $100 million to support the AMR Action Fund, a collaboration of more than 20 biopharmaceutical companies that aims to bring two to four new antibiotics to patients by 2030."
Pfizer plans to use proceeds from the Sustainability Bond to invest $20 million over 5 years.
The Fund has begun investing in clinical-stage biotechs developing antibiotics and other anti-infectives that target WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) priority drug-resistant pathogens.
"These investments are expected to help bring novel antibiotics to market and, importantly, re-establish an innovation ecosystem to support long term antibiotic development."
"In 2022, Pfizer contributed $7 million of the Funds $54 million investment to three early stage drug development companies aligned with this focus: Ventorex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Adaptive Phage Therapeutics, Inc., and BioVersys AG."

Thats why we have made long-standing commitments to climate action through resource conservation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions.
"Over the period 2001 2021 we reduced our Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 64%, fully delivering three generations of GHG goals."
"In 2015, we were one of the first companies to have our then GHG emissions reduction goal approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), and we remain committed to developing and implementing a science-based climate action strategy."
"In June 2022 we announced our ambition to achieve the voluntary Net-Zero standard by 2040, 10 years ahead of the timeline outlined in the standard."
"In addition, as described in our Climate Change Position Statement, we aim to conduct robust risk assessments to safeguard resiliency of our research, manufacturing, and commercial activities and to transparently report on our progress, risks, and opportunities aligned with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) recommendations."
"Governance Pfizer has embedded Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) principles into the companys strategy and has identified climate change as one of six priorities in Pfizers ESG strategy."
"Our climate change strategy is championed by the Executive Vice President, Chief Global Supply Officer, who reports to the CEO."
"Implementation of the strategy is led and managed by the Global Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) team in partnership with Legal with active engagement of a cross-disciplinary team of leaders representing Engineering, Facilities, Sourcing, Scientific and Manufacturing lines, and is integrated into Pfizers operational and risk management processes as described below."
"Risk & Operational Governance: The Governance & Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of independent directors, provides oversight of Pfizers ESG strategy and reporting and corporate citizenship matters."
The committee is regularly updated by management on Pfizers climate action program and progress toward goals.
"Pfizers Global Supply (PGS) Quality & Compliance Committee (PGS QCC) reports key risks, including those related to climate change, to the Executive Compliance Committee of Pfizers Executive Leadership Team, including the CEO, and to the Regulatory and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors."
The PGS QCC risk management process also informs Pfizers Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program.
"Pfizers ERM program provides a framework for risk identification and management of significant risks, including risks related to climate change and the long- term sustainability of the business."
"Each risk is assigned to a member or members, as appropriate, of the Executive Leadership Team."
"The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of independent directors, has primary responsibility for overseeing Pfizers ERM program."
"Periodically, the Regulatory and Compliance Committee and the Audit Committee hold joint sessions to discuss risks relevant to both committees areas of risk oversight, including an annual discussion of the ERM program."
The board is kept informed of its committees risk oversight and other activities through reports by the committee chairs to the full board.
Pfizers integration of climate change into divisional and enterprise risk management processes includes reviewing risks that could be material to the company to support U.
S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 10-K reporting.
More information on the risk assessment process for climate change is provided in the risk assessment section below.
"Manufacturing at our internal network of sites, managed by PGS, accounts for over 70% of the companys energy consumption and GHG emissions."
"The Executive Vice President, Chief Global Supply Officer leads Pfizers manufacturing and supply chain, serves as the executive sponsor of climate change risk management and has operational control over PGS operations and strategy, including operating expenses (OPEX) and capital expense (CAPEX) investment in GHG emission reduction projects."
Environmental sustainability has been integrated into Pfizers business strategy and GHG emissions reduction is monitored as a key performance indicator.
"In 2022, an ESG modifier that includes a climate performance KPI was added to Pfizers annual performance-based variable bonus program to support Pfizers commitment to reducing GHG emissions."
"ESG Governance: The ESG function within Pfizer and its cross-functional governing committees (at the senior management and the executive level) have responsibility for considering and adopting potential goals and targets, with escalation to the Governance & Sustainability Committee (G&SC) of the Board, based on input from experienced subject matter experts and advisors."
"Our cross-functional Sustainability Steering Committee, chaired by our Chief Sustainability Officer, advises on key issues and guides the integration and implementation of Pfizers non-financial reporting related to ESG."
"This Committee is overseen by a chartered Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the Executive Leadership Team member leading Corporate Affairs, who reports directly to the Chairman and CEO."
"Strategy Our Scenario Analysis Process To improve the understanding of Pfizers resilience to the impacts of climate change, we conducted an in-depth assessment of our exposure to physical and transition risks and opportunities using scenario analysis; informed by data modelling insights from a global sustainability consultancy."
"Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report AppendixPerformance Appendix Governance Social Environment Impact Stories IntroductionPfizer 2022 ESG Report75 Aligned with TCFD guidance, we assessed risks and opportunities on a short- (2030) and long-term (2050) basis, while also considering transition risks and opportunities on a medium-term basis (2040)."
"This is aligned with our strategic 2040 Net-Zero planning, international and national climate policy milestones, and the expected lifetime of our assets."
The scenario analysis began with the identification of relevant physical and transition risks and opportunities that could have a potential impact on our business.
Each risk and opportunity was qualitatively assessed using impact and uncertainty ratings and validated with a wide range of stakeholders representing different Pfizer functions and divisions.
Impact ratings were assigned using the same categorizations applied in our enterprise risk management framework.
"As climate scenarios are inherently uncertain, the scenario analysis considered the full range of potential impacts from all scenarios without considering the likelihood of each scenario developing."
"The top 20 potential risks and opportunities were prioritized based on the impact- uncertainty rating for a deeper dive using specific scenario data, using physical and transition scenarios described in Table 1."
"For each prioritized item, a scenario indicator was assigned, acting as a proxy to explore how it may develop in each scenario."
"These were combined with exposure ratings, derived from the assigned impact rating, to give an overall risk / opportunity rating at each timeframe."
Items rated a high risk / opportunity at any timeframe are described in Table 2.Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report Continued AppendixPhysical IPCC SSP1-2.6+1.8C +4.4C +3C +1.5CIPCC SSP5-8.5 NGFS Current Policies (CP) NGFS Net- Zero 2050 (NZ 2050)TransitionType Description Scenario 2100 Warming Key Parameters & Assumptions This scenario is aligned to the current commitments under the Paris Agreement.
"The world shifts towards a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development, driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals."
"Global Net-Zero reached in 2050 Renewables account for more than half of the energy supply by 2050 Few challenges to climate mitigation and adaptation Energy demand triples by 2100, dominated by fossil fuels Current atmospheric CO2 levels double by 2050 Many challenges to climate mitigation, with few challenges to adaptation Emissions peak in 2080 IPCCs SSP2 Middle of the Road socioeconomic assumptions adjusted for COVID-19 impact1 Ambitious climate policy is introduced immediately Global Net-Zero reached in 2050 IPCCs SSP2 Middle of the Road socioeconomic assumptions adjusted for COVID-19 impact1This is a high emissions scenario with no additional climate policy (business-as- usual)."
The push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world.
"This scenario assumes that only currently implemented policies are preserved, with an expected temperature outcome of ~3C."
"This is an ambitious scenario that limits global warming to 1.5 C through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching Net-Zero CO emissions around 2050.Table 1 NGFS Climate Scenarios for central banks and supervisors ."
"Network for Greening the Financial System, June 2021, p. 21."
"1Performance Appendix Governance Social Environment Impact Stories IntroductionPfizer 2022 ESG Report76 Transition Risk - Carbon pricing mechanismsPolicy & Legal Technology Resource Efficiency MarketTransition Risk - Stakeholder pressure to decarbonize capital assets Transition Risk - Increasing energy price volatility Transition Risk Increasing demand for low-carbon productsRisk or opportunity TCFD Category Description Potential Financial Impact Scenario & Risk / Opportunity Rating As policymakers implement carbon pricing mechanisms in more geographies, as well as increase the weight and scope of these mechanisms, Pfizer is increasingly exposed to the cost of carbon in our operations and could be exposed to pass-through costs in the supply chain."
"Carbon prices are expected to increase dramatically in a Net-Zero scenario, reaching upwards of $200 / mtCO2e."
A growing need to decarbonize and reach Net-Zero to meet both internal Net-Zero targets and external stakeholder pressure will require large investment to decarbonize capital assets.
"This could include replacing production equipment with equipment that is newer and more efficient, runs on renewables or alternative fuel sources, or is electrically powered."
"In the NZ2050 scenario, emissions in the chemicals sector decrease significantly, from almost 3,000M mtCO2 in 2020 to less than 500M mtCO2 in 2040."
Achieving this emissions reduction will require significant capital investment.
A transition away from fossil fuels may result in volatile energy and fuel prices.
"Rapid shifts away from fossil fuel supplies without adequate low-carbon energy infrastructure in place could lead to supply constraints, which may be exacerbated in a disorderly scenario."
"Gas price increases sharply in the NZ2050 scenario reaching almost $30 / gigajoule (GJ) in 2050, more than double the gas price in the CP scenario ($12.5 / GJ)."
"An increasing number of national healthcare systems and countries have announced targets to become Net-Zero by future dates, e.g., NHS England 2050 Net-Zero target which may impose additional requirements of their suppliers and a preference for low-carbon goods."
There may be increasing pressure to decarbonize products across their whole life cycle including Scope 3 emissions.
"As ~80% of Pfizers emissions are Scope 3, there is additional complexity in producing low-carbon products as it relies on suppliers decarbonizing their operations."
"Competitor products with lower emissions intensity / lower energy demand than Pfizer products may lead to substitution of Pfizer products, resulting in reduced revenues.2030: High risk 2040: High risk 2050: High risk 2030: Medium risk 2040: High risk 2050: High risk 2030: Medium risk 2040: High risk 2050: High risk 2030: Medium risk 2040: High risk 2050: High riskIncreased direct costs and increased indirect (operating) costs Increased capital expenditures, decreased asset value or asset useful life leading to write-offs, and asset impairment or early retirement of existing assets Increased direct costs Decreased revenues due to reduced demand for products and servicesTable 2Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report Continued AppendixPerformance Appendix Governance Social Environment Impact Stories IntroductionPfizer 2022 ESG Report77 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report Continued AppendixRisk or opportunity TCFD Category Description Potential Financial Impact Scenario & Risk / Opportunity RatingTable 2 - continued Resource Efficiency Market Chronic physicalTransition Opportunity Increased resilience to energy and fuel price volatility Transition Opportunity Increasing demand for low-carbon products Physical Risk - Water scarcity and drought impact on operationsThrough replacing our capital assets to become more efficient and use alternative fuel sources, Pfizer could increase resilience to volatile fuel and energy prices resulting from the low-carbon transition and increase returns on investment in low-emissions technology."
"Gas price increases sharply in the NZ2050 scenario reaching almost $30 / GJ in 2050, more than double the gas price in the CP scenario ($12.5 / GJ)."
"Transitioning from gas to alternative sources of heating therefore is a cost savings, reducing Pfizers exposure to increasing gas prices."
Fuel prices would be expected to follow a similar trajectory.
"An increasing number of national healthcare systems and countries have announced targets to become Net-Zero by future dates, e.g., 2050 including in their supply chain i.e., the suppliers and pharmaceutical products used by healthcare providers."
Healthcare systems may therefore prefer or require suppliers to provide low-carbon products.
"If Pfizers products are demonstrably lower in carbon than competitors, this may lead to increased demand for products and increase revenue."
"Higher temperatures and more extreme, less predictable, weather conditions under climate change are expected to affect water availability by altering the distribution of rainfall, snowmelt, river flows and groundwater."
"A lower availability of water may heighten potential financial risk for Pfizer by increasing water costs, and / or reducing revenue due to production shutdowns."
"By 2030, under a high emissions scenario, almost half of the 40 manufacturing and research and development sites assessed during the scenario analysis are shown to be at a high risk of water scarcity and drought.2030: High opportunity 2040: High opportunity 2050: High opportunity 2030: Medium opportunity 2040: High opportunity 2050: High opportunity 2030: High risk 2050: High riskDecreased direct costs and increased demand for products and services Increased revenues resulting from increased demand for products and services Increased direct (operating) costs and decreased revenues due to reduced production capacityPerformance Appendix Governance Social Environment Impact Stories IntroductionPfizer 2022 ESG Report78 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report Continued AppendixRisk or opportunity TCFD Category Description Potential Financial Impact Scenario & Risk / Opportunity RatingTable 2 - continued Acute physical Acute physicalPhysical Risk - River and extreme rainfall flooding impact on operations and supply chain Physical Risk - Extreme heat impact on operations and supply chainExtreme weather events, including high levels of precipitation and extreme rainfall, are projected to increase due to climate change."
"This is likely to heighten both the frequency and intensity of flooding, increasing the risk of physical damage to infrastructure, and / or supply chain disruption."
"By 2030, under a high emissions scenario, 7 of the 36 manufacturing sites assessed during the scenario analysis are shown to be at a high risk of flooding."
Maximum temperatures and the frequency of extreme heat events are anticipated to rise globally due to climate change.
"A higher prevalence of this hazard may increase potential financial risk for Pfizer by increasing operating costs associated with running air conditioning, or backup generators if electricity supply is interrupted, and / or reducing revenue due to production shutdowns."
"By 2050, under a high emissions scenario, eight of the 40 manufacturing and research and development sites assessed during the scenario analysis are shown to be at a high risk of extreme heat.2030: High risk 2050: High risk 2030: Low risk 2050: High riskIncreased capital expenditures, increased direct (operating) costs, decreased asset value or asset useful life leading to write- offs, and decreased revenues due to reduced production capacity Increased direct costs and decreased revenues due to reduced production capacity."
"Performance Appendix Governance Social Environment Impact Stories IntroductionPfizer 2022 ESG Report79 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report Continued AppendixStrategic Resilience Under Climate Scenarios Following the findings from the scenario analysis, we consider our current business model and strategy to be resilient under the assessed scenarios."
A number of risks and opportunities were found to have potential impact on financial performance and financial position for which mitigation measures have been identified.
"To further understand the financial impact of these risks, Pfizer has begun a pilot to quantify the financial impact of selected potentially significant items."
"We will evaluate the findings from the pilot, refine the methodologies and data sources, and expand quantification to other items in the next year."
"Physical climate risks are currently managed through our Loss Prevention and Business Resilience programs, described in further detail under Risk Management."
We continue to review these programs considering the scenario analysis to assess whether further measures could be required.
"By achieving our Net-Zero goal we can mitigate many transition risks and maximize transition opportunities identified in the scenario analysis (e.g., meeting an increased demand for low-carbon products and minimizing our exposure to volatile energy prices)."
We plan to publish a transition plan summarizing the strategies and actions we are taking to achieve our goal.
It should be noted that there are key uncertainties associated with using global climate models to project the effects of physical risks on our business strategy.
These include uncertainties in how: Future emissions could lead to changes in the global climate system; Changes in this larger system may evolve for us locally; and Climate hazards could manifest due to natural variability which is not fully captured by the models.
Trends in some physical climate hazards are also more difficult to project than others.
"For example, hazards driven by rainfall variables (e.g., flooding, water stress and drought) are more uncertain than those related to temperature variables (e.g., extreme heat) as they depend on the response of regional atmospheric circulations to global warming.2 Key uncertainties that could influence our resilience to transition risks and opportunities include: How quickly our suppliers can decarbonize; given that 80% of our emissions are in the value chain rather than in our direct operations; How quickly technology will become commercially available to decarbonize our company hard to abate processes; and How healthcare systems and services will implement Net-Zero requirements in the supply chain."
"Impact of Climate-related Risks and Opportunities on our Businesses, Strategy, and Financial Planning Climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced Pfizers business strategy and are incorporated into financial planning."
"In 2020, Pfizer completed a $1.25 billion ten-year sustainability bond, a first for a biopharmaceutical company."
"Proceeds from the bond are being used to help manage our environmental impact and support increased patient access to Pfizers medicines and vaccines, especially among underserved populations, and strengthen healthcare systems."
"As of December 31, 2022, the net proceeds of approximately $1.24 billion from the March 2020 Sustainability Bond were fully allocated, funding a portion of the aggregate spend of $1.275 billion."
Certain of these funds have been allocated to more environmentally efficient design and construction of a new office and manufacturing facility (a breakdown of the specific allocation of funds can be found on page 59).
Pfizer responds to numerous requests for environmental performance information from current customers and as part of tenders.
"While the level of influence that our environmental performance has on customer purchasing decisions has not been fully quantified, the number of customer and tender inquiries has been observed to increase each year."
Annual targets are established for energy conservation project savings.
Our medium and large sites are required to maintain master plans that identify opportunities for emission reductions.
These projects are reviewed through our capital project appropriation process.
The costs to implement these projects as well as the expected cost savings are included in the sites operating budgets and / or capital plans as appropriate.
Our Loss Prevention and Business Resilience programs assess and manage potential impacts of acute and chronic physical risks on our operations.
Assessments are refreshed annually.
Costs to maintain Pfizers risk engineering provider is estimated at $0.3M annually.
"Costs relating to property protection and supply chain management are annualized, expected to be incurred annually and are incorporated into existing budgets."
Site protection systems improvements and maintenance costs are estimated at $0.1M annually.
Direct staff costs related to managing this risk is estimated at $2.0M annually.
Multiple sources are used to consider these uncertainties and variables.
"IPCC AR6 is one of the primary sources, but also includes sources for specific hazards such as flooding and water stress and drought, including WRI Aqueduct and Fathom-Global 2.0.2Performance Appendix Governance Social Environment Impact Stories IntroductionPfizer 2022 ESG Report80 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report Continued AppendixRisk Management Pfizers strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities includes our ambitious 2040 Net-Zero target covering our operations and entire value chain."
"Measures we take to mitigate climate-related risks include: Operational emissions reductions To achieve our public goals for GHG emission reductions, Pfizer has implemented numerous efficiency improvements to our operations."
"We look for opportunities to design environmental sustainability attributes into new facility or renovation projects, replace equipment at end of life with energy-efficient alternates, and invest in no / low carbon technologies at our sites and in programs that enable sourcing of clean energy from renewable sources (for example, our North American solar virtual power purchase agreement is described on page 23 of our ESG report)."
We are a member of Renewable Energy 100 (RE100) and we have a goal to achieve 80% renewable electricity by 2025 and 100% by 2030.
We are currently working to develop site-specific emissions reduction plans to achieve our near-term (2030) and Net Zero (2040) targets.
Research and innovation in green chemistry Pfizer has a long history of using the concepts of green chemistry and promoting them across our industry.
Through scientific innovation we aim to design more efficient processes that can reduce the environmental impact of our medicines throughout the product life cycle.
"To support environmental footprint reduction efforts, Pfizer is conducting representative life cycle assessments (LCAs) for small molecules, large molecules, vaccines, and devices."
"Guided by these assessments, we are working to define environmental sustainability criteria across the product lifecycle."
Loss Prevention and Business Continuity programs Pfizers primary controls for the management of acute and chronic physical risks are our infrastructure and systems.
Many of our facilities are located in areas with limited exposure to physical risks and we have robust processes in place to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
"Through our Loss Prevention and Business Continuity programs we maintain plans to minimize business disruption, including alternative sourcing options and buffer inventory (depending on product)."
Pfizer maintains resources for assessing and establishing business continuity arrangements such as the activation of alternative supply chains.
"Supply chain and business continuity professionals are retained as staff and consultants to ensure these plans are updated at least annually, exercised at least annually, and key colleagues on site are trained on their content and implementation."
Working and engaging our suppliers As part of our Net-Zero goal we aim to use our influence to catalyze ambitious GHG emissions reductions across our value chain.
"We are implementing a multipronged approach, including embedding environmental sustainability criteria in our vendor selection processes, strengthening expectations within contracts, and engaging with key suppliers of goods and services to drive at least 64% by spend to adopt science based GHG emission reduction goals (SBT goals) by 2025."
"Pfizer is part of Energize, a collaboration between 10 global pharmaceutical companies that provides pharmaceutical suppliers, some of which may not otherwise have the internal resources or expertise available, the opportunity to participate in the market for power purchase agreements."
"We are also members of Activate, a collective action initiative supporting the decarbonization of active pharmaceutical ingredient supply chains."
Metrics & Targets Pfizer calculates Scope 1 and 2 emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol (revised edition).
Our 2019-2021 GHG data (including Scope 3 categories 1-8 and 15) was independently assured pursuant to ISAE 3000 (revised) by ERM-CVS and verification of 2022 data is underway.
"Emissions are reported annually in our CDP response and are broken down by type, country, and business division."
"We also track metrics relative to our business continuity and disaster recovery programs (e.g., number of supplier assessments completed; sites with fully implemented plans for the management of risk associated with natural perils such as flooding and severe weather, noting it is not possible to state with certainty whether individual weather events are a result of climate change)."
"Pfizer discloses our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions annually through our CDP submittal and publishes our Scope 1 + 2 emissions in our ESG Report (formerly in our Annual Review) and on our website."
"We have achieved three consecutive GHG reduction goals (2000-2007, 2007-2012, and 2012-2020) and have reduced our GHG emissions over 60% since 2000."
We remain committed to ambitious long-term actions and have announced our ambition to achieve the Science Based Target initiatives voluntary Net-Zero standard by 2040.
"As part of the commitment, Pfizer aims to decrease our GHG emissions by 95% and value chain emissions by 90% from 2019 levels by 2040 through accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels and engaging suppliers to catalyze equivalent action."
"In 2020, after achieving our third generation GHG emission reduction goal, Pfizer set a new goal to reduce Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions 46% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline and, by 2025, advancing goals to reduce emissions in three Scope 3 categories."
This includes catalyzing 64% of suppliers of goods and services by spend to set science-based emission reduction goals and reducing emissions related to upstream logistics by 10% and business travel by 25% by 2025 from a 2019 baseline.
Pfizer continues to make progress towards these near-term targets while advancing our long-term Net- Zero by 2040 goal.
"Recognizing that Scope 3 emissions are the most challenging to quantify due to complex global value chains, inconsistent methodologies, and lack of transparent disclosure, we have launched initiatives to improve our measurement and reporting capabilities and are collaborating with our pharmaceutical peers to align on Scope 3 data collection and emissions calculation methodologies."
