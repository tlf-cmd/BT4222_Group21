FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 5 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubESG materiality and reporting Developing an understanding of our most important ESG topics is crucial to Ciscos strategic planning initiatives and reporting.
"Our latest full ESG materiality assessment , conducted in fiscal 2021, identified 18 priority ESG topics, as illustrated in Table 1."
"This assessment included multiple methods, including analysis of stakeholder inquiries, peer benchmarking, and direct input from investors, thought leaders, and Cisco employees including Global Inclusive Communities (Ciscos employee resource organizations), executives, and sales professionals."
"Throughout the year, we engage d with a wide range of global and local organizations to shape and extend the reach of our ESG programs, including governments, nonprofits, multilateral organizations, and peers."
"In fiscal 2022, we completed an interim ESG materiality assessment to verify that our most recent full assessment reflects our stakeholders priority topics, changes within our business and strategy, and the global landscape."
The results of the interim analysis a ffirmed our topic prioritization.
"Ciscos ESG reporting is aligned with standards set by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) , Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) , the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) , and CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) ."
We also align our ESG e fforts with many of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) .
The 17 SDGs set forth a framework to build a better world for people and our planet by 2030 and are designed to be applied by governments and organizations worldwide.
The success of the SDGs requires global cooperation and ambitious commitmentsideas that square with our own commitments to inclusivity and help to create opportunity for all.

"The baseline and progress reported for our 2030 goal includes: purchased goods and services from manufacturing, component, and warehouse suppliers; upstream transportation and distribution from Cisco purchased air transportation; and use of sold products."
3 Packaging efficiency is measured by comparing the size of the product relative to the packaging using dimensional weight.
Dimensional weight uses volume and a standard dimensional factor to calculate the weight of a package.
"In this methodology, the packaging efficiency metric is based on the difference of the normalized dimensional weight (by volume) between the baseline and current year."
"4 In fiscal 2022, we had a soft launch of the scoring tool to evaluate 13 percent of new products and packaging, and 33 percent of them successfully met our circular design criteria."
This is equivalent to 4 percent of total new products and packaging released in fiscal 2022 meeting circular design criteria.
"In early fiscal 2023, the scoring tool was formally launched across all business units, so we expect the universe of new products and packaging evaluated to increase in fiscal 2023."
"5 The plastics included in this goal exclude those contained in commodity components sourced from suppliers (e.g., plastic screws, fans, and cables)."
"6 According to current standard definitions used in certification protocols, zero waste diversion is defined as a 90 percent or greater overall diversion of solid, nonhazardous wastes from landfill, incineration (waste-to-energy), and the environment."
"Diversion methods can include reduction, reuse, recycling, and/or compost."

"During this devastating time, we have continued to support the people of Ukraine with aidas well as essential connectivity and security services that only Cisco can provide."
"An invisible line of defense In January 2022, as Russian troops began to amass at the Ukrainian border, Talos, Ciscos threat intelligence arm, started preparing, too."
"Knowing that cyber attacks against Ukrainian citizens and infrastructure were likely, we increased our monitoring for unusual activity."
"The stakes were, and remain, incredibly high."
Says J.
"J. Cummings, Cisco Talos Threat Intelligence & Interdiction team lead, We can stop attacks that could result in power outages by identifying early adversary behavior and stopping it."
"This could include keeping the power on in hospitals where patients are being treated for critical care, whether from the battlefield or a standard medical emergency."
"Throughout the war, Talos experts have worked alongside customer security teams to identify and block threats."
"We have offered this support for free, along with free autorenewals of our security products and services."
"Its the right thing to do, Cummings says."
"Purpose Personified: Keeping the power on assists with other urgent needs, like people staying in touch with the rest of the world to get their message out so we can understand what is happening."

"And as a company with expertise in powering hybrid workas well as the provider of networking, collaboration, and security technologies that make this new reality possible for thousands of partners and customerswe regularly share best practices on how other organizations can make hybrid work, work."
Its not about the number of days spent in the office.
"Building an inclusive, hybrid world is about creating strong, connected, empowered teams, delivering solutions for customers, and strengthening company culture."
"Our holistic view of hybrid work has four integrated pillars: Building a holistic, inclusive hybrid world The future of work is hybrid and global."
"Between 2019 and 2021, the number of Americans working primarily from home tripled, and this transformation in the way we work is here to stay."
Cisco was a pioneer in hybrid work long before the pandemic.
"Today, 70 percent of our first-line managers have at least one remote employee."
"People Our people practices are grounded in our Conscious Culture, which means we intentionally create an environment where everyone is seen, heard, and included."
"A successful hybrid model prioritizes flexibility, wellbeing, inclusion, and engagement enabling us to hire and advance the careers of people everywhere."
Weve found that remote work provides opportunities for mentorship and growth for employees at every stage of their career.
"Policies and guidelines Hybrid work means we can offer our people flexibility, choice, and agency."
Our policies and guidelines create a flexible hybrid environment while remaining compliant with local laws and regulations.
"Ciscos latest guidelines cover temporary assignments, permanent moves, home office and Internet policies, and expense reimbursements."
"At every step on our hybrid journey, we ensure that our standards are clear, inclusive, and accessible."

"Hybrid work can be both smart and sustainable Ciscos Collaboration Centers are digitally enabled, efficient workspaces that create a comfortable, safe, and inspiring environment for customers and employees to meet."
The redesign of our Penn 1 building in New York City uses Power over Ethernet capabilities that removed thousands of pounds of steel conduit and copper from the building and reduced energy needs by tons of megawatts.
"The building also uses Cisco video endpoints to monitor and measure occupancy, space utilization, indoor air quality, energy usage, and security."
"With these insights, we can automatically adjust smart blinds, lighting, and HVAC settingsfurther reducing our expenses and energy use."
3 4 FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 12 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubHow does a net-zero goal align with Ciscos purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All?
We cant have any kind of future if we dont have a healthy planet.
"Beyond that, the promise of technology is that it enables us to rethink business models in ways that are digital and low-carbon, but also improve individual wellbeing and create opportunities for communities."
"One example is hybrid work, which helps enable inclusion because it allows us to include more people, and more work styles, in more places."
"Hybrid work can also have environmental benefits, particularly when combined with smart building technology that uses sensors and low-voltage Power over Ethernet."
"These innovations allow us to monitor and control temperature, lighting, and air quality, as well as reduce embodied carbon from steel conduits and copper wiring."
"This is the kind of digital, low-carbon, inclusive thinking we want to accelerateholistic solutions that benefit business, people, communities, and the planet."
Why was now the right time for Cisco to set a net-zero goal?
Our world is at a tipping point.
"I think were all seeing the impact of climate change, whether in the form of hurricanes, flooding, droughts, or fires."
"Given the climate reality, its time for societies to think beyond mitigation and consider adaptation and regeneration as well."
This moment also presents an inflection point for businesses.
"To survive in this new reality, businesses must become not only digital, but also low-carbon."
"Cisco has helped our customers accelerate their digital transformations since our founding, and today we have an opportunity to bring about a low-carbon transformation through our global reach as well."
"Q AQ AA net-zero business is just the beginning Mary de Wysocki, Ciscos first Chief Sustainability Officer, shares the strides the company has made not just toward decarbonizing our own businessbut bringing customers, suppliers, and community partners along for the journey."
FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 13 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubCisco has a long history of goal-setting including more than a decades worth of emissions goalsand rigorously reporting on and validating those goals.
Why is validation so important?
Its important to help validate our impact through external verification because it ensures that our actions are having the outcomes we intend.
"Ciscos net zero by 2040 goal achieved validation from the SBTi under its new Net-Zero Standard, which requires us to reduce our absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions 90 percent by 2040."
The SBTi also requires interim goals and annual updates on progress that will keep us accountable.
"Having an SBTi-validated goal means that you must address emissions across your value chain, not just your own operations."
How do you approach reducing emissions and driving transformation more broadly?
Helping our customers and suppliers meet their own decarbonization goals is a critical way that Cisco will help bring about a digital and low-carbon future.
The use of Ciscos products makes up the majority of our emissions footprint.
"Our engineers have made great progress in power efficiency and circular design, and were also seeing customers ask for more capabilities and greater bandwidth that increase power demands."
"That means we must think even bigger, exploring ways to accelerate renewable energy adoption and the greening of the grid."
Our second-largest source of emissions is our supply chain.
"Cisco has set a goal that 80 percent of our top component, manufacturing and logistics suppliers will set public GHG emissions reductions targets by 2025, and we regularly share our learnings with them."
Q A Q ACisco has practiced a social investment strategy focused on early-stage solutions for more than 20 years through the Cisco Foundation.
How will your experience in this space support emissions reduction beyond your value chain?
The Cisco Foundationalong with innovation competitions we organize like the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challengehelps stimulate cutting-edge innovation in areas where its most needed.
"Today, the Foundation focuses on early-stage decarbonization technology and nature-based solutions to climate change."
These investments send a signal to other investors about what we value and where we believe the future is headed.
"A recent Cisco Foundation grantee Im particularly excited about is Seacology and its Dominican Republic Mangrove Initiative , which supports businesses that protect the countrys critical mangrove forests."
Mangroves are known for helping sequester carbon as well as protecting coastlines from storm surges and sea level rise a great example of tackling both climate change mitigation and adaptation at the same time.
"The initiative also provides jobs for residents in vulnerable coastal areas, building powerful connections with members of these communities and demonstrating the importance of inclusion in the low-carbon transition."
"Q A Photo Credit: SeacologyFUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 14 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubEthically build and deliver technology that securely powers the worlds connectivity As the stewards of the data that make modern life possible, technology companies must earn customers and users trust."
This means being mindful of how our products are made and used and taking steps to address potential negative impacts.
"Cisco strives to design and build technology in ways that respect human rights, promote inclusion, and protect privacy and security so that everyone can benefit from a more connected world."
"Power In this section: 16 Security, privacy and trust 19 Human rights 22 Ethics and integrity 23 Digital inclusionFUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 15 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubSecurity, privacy and trust Data underlies nearly every aspect of how we work, play, learn, and connect."
"The security and privacy of data, therefore, is closely tied to many of the worlds challenges."
"Today, as teams increasingly work in a distributed fashion, organizations need new ways to securely connect users, applications, and things."
Threats such as ransomware and exploitation of software vulnerabilities are increasingly commonplace.
Cyberspace has become a new frontier in global warfare.
"For example, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine , cyber attacks against Ukrainian users have surged."
"In this environment, regulatory and consumer expectations of companies regarding security, privacy, and trust are higher than everand Cisco is proud to be a leader in this space."
"As a large, global enterprise, we must safeguard our business and help customers do the same."
Our security products and solutions provide the protection that businesses need.
"We are also committed to sharing our perspective on matters of security, privacy, and trust so that all organizations can operate more safely."
"To this end, in fiscal 2022, Cisco published The New Trust Standard a compilation of what weve learned from our experiences securing and digitally enabling thousands of customers around the world."
"While the building blocks of trust will surely evolve further in response to changing customer expectations, technology, cyber threats, and international data governance, The New Trust Standard provides a framework for trusted digital relationships today."
Our Impact Our commitment to transparency Governmental organizations at all levels around the world use Cisco technology.
They also set policies and regulations that determine how technology should operate.
"Engaging with policymakers, regulators, and government agencies on matters related to security, privacy, and trust is an essential part of our work."
"For example, we occasionally receive requests for data related to ongoing investigations from law enforcement, intelligence agencies, or governments."
"When this happens, Cisco follows a strict set of policies and procedures to help ensure that data disclosures are minimized and controlled, and that access to our solutions and services remains free from unlawful intrusion."
"We publish data related to these requests, including the number of requests by country and how many requests we fulfill or reject, every six months in our Transparency Reports ."
"On May 12, 2021, U."
S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order mandating more transparency in the software supply chain.
Cisco stood ready to respond to this order and supports the tech industrys adoption of software bills of materials (SBOMs).
"Later in the year, after a vulnerability was discovered in the Apache Log4j 2 open-source software, Cisco Senior Vice President and Chief Security and Trust Officer Brad Arkin spoke to a U."

FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 16 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubOur approach to responsible AI helps us design for fairness from ideation and make improvements throughout the product lifecycle.
"Valuing privacy and inclusion in software designWhen it comes to Powering an Inclusive Future for All, respect for human rights is a fundamental innovation principle."
"Privacy, security, and inclusion must be central in the design methodology, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence and machine learning."
"Training data sets often determine how product design and user experience take shapethe adage goodness in, goodness out certainly applies."
"Developers must take steps to ensure these data sets are robust, diverse, and representative of all users."
"Failing to do so can result in inaccuracies, disappointing user experiences, and unintended bias."
"Take, for example, Webex virtual backgrounds, which are designed to hide users surroundings to enhance privacy, security, professionalism, and fun."
"Early research versions of this feature, which reflected the state of the art at the time, did not perform well for certain hair textures and styles, or lighting conditions."
"In some cases, they inadvertently filtered out portions of a users appearance."
"Our engineers recognized that broader, more diverse training data sets that were representative of the Webex user base were required, and addressed this during the design phase before releasing the feature."
"By applying data that was anonymized, ethically sourced, user-contributed, open-source, provided with explicit consent, and respectful of individual privacy in other ways, we made the training data more robust."
"This resulted in more representative images and algorithms, and a much better and more inclusive user experience for all."
"In 2022, we built on the learnings from the Webex team and launched our Responsible AI Framework based on six principles: Transparency, Fairness, Accountability, Privacy, Security, and Reliability."
"Our Responsible AI Working Group continuously drives adherence to these principles by putting new technologies through Responsible AI Impact Assessments, offering guidance on how to manage risk to human rights, and providing accountability via incident reporting of human rights, privacy, and security concerns."
FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 17 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubDelivering security and privacy everywhere Cisco has an important role to play in improving the worlds cybersecurity.
"We actively engage in the development of industry standards and international frameworks, such as the EU Cloud Code of Conduct, the Global Cross Border Privacy Rules system, and Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative."
"We are steadfast in upholding our commitments to security and privacy by design, anchored on the principles of transparency, fairness, and accountability."
"At the same time, we are raising the bar to meet new threats and current realities."
"For example, we are taking steps to secure open-source software, responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in our products and services, support government and third-party initiatives to deliver more trustworthy software, and enable Data Free Flows with Trust (DFFT) ."
"We are also strengthening our capabilities to help customers defend their critical infrastructurelike hospitals, utilities, transportation, and government servicesagainst threats."
Protecting these essential functions amounts to keeping as many organizations as possible above the cyber security poverty line .
Sharing our expertise with all We view security and privacy as an imperative for all organizations.
"Thats why we work to share our knowledge and solutions widely with our customers, industry associations, and private- and public-sector organizations around the world."
"For our employee base, Cisco offers both required security and privacy training to all employees and specialized training and certifications for security and privacy professionals."
We share tips for users to keep themselves and their families safe online.
"To make security and privacy more accessible, we offer open-source software and free versions of some of our most popular security solutions, such as Snort for real-time traffic analysis and packet logging, and ClamAV for detecting trojans, viruses, malware, and other malicious threats."
We conduct research on key privacy issues facing organizations and consumers and publish the reports on our Trust Center .

"FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 18 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubHuman rights As a major provider of the technology that connects much of the world, Ciscos stakeholders trust us to consider human rights across every aspect of our global operations, from sourcing and supply chain to the design and use of our products."
We strive to meet this responsibility in a way that reflects the global nature and complexity of our business and the rapid pace of innovation.
"We focus on striving to protect all groups, and particularly vulnerable ones, from harm."
These measures include auditing for proper treatment of people working for our component suppliers and putting controls in place to help design our products with consideration for all users.
"We govern human rights within our business and supply chain through our Global Human Rights Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct , which are managed by our Business and Human Rights team and Supply Chain Sustainability team."
We have established executive-level committees to help inform and advise the work of these dedicated subject-matter experts.
"We continue to strengthen our processes and policies as technology, risks, and expectations of businesses evolve."
Our impact Across the Cisco enterprise We are continuing to mature our Business and Human Rights approach.
"For example, we have expanded our human rights focus within product development, and we are looking across the value chain to help address human rights impacts that we may be linked to through our business relationships."
We integrate human rights into our product design methodologies.
"For example, AI/ML technologies have the potential to make sense of large amounts of data more quickly and efficiently than humans can."
But they can also make mistakes that could harm human rights or erode customer trust.
"In addition to Ciscos Responsible AI framework, the Responsible AI/ML Committee, also established in fiscal 2022, defines and directs governance of the implementation and use of AI across our operations and solutions."
"With this structure in place, we are now conducting assessments to help us identify risks and consult with product teams as they work to address them."
One of Ciscos 12 Social Justice Actions is to embed a human rights perspective into the daily aspects of how we operate.
"This includes incorporating human rights into our corporate governance, policies, and product development."
"In addition, our new Inclusive Language Policy and open-source inclusive language tools are small steps in the right direction."
Visit Ciscos ESG Reporting Hub for more information on our efforts related to human rights.
"Customers, partners, and stakeholders trust Cisco to build and deliver the technology that powers the Internet."
Core to this trust is Ciscos commitment to respect human rights throughout our global operations.

Privacy is more than a compliance obligationits a fundamental human right.
"Security, privacy, and trust are core to Ciscos business offerings."
"Cisco has a long-standing commitment to help protect the privacy of minors, including in its role as an EdTech provider."
This foundation of trusted technology is why many academic institutions turned to Webex at the outset of the pandemicand why they continue to embrace the possibilities of remote education.
"As children spend more time online, we saw increased risks of negative outcomes like cyberbullying and harassment."
Our team updated the tools features to meet the unique needs of teachers and students.
"New features weve incorporated include: yTiered recording permission, meaning both the host of a meeting and the meetings participants must give permission for a meeting to be recorded yDefault safety and privacy settings, such as blurring users backgrounds and not allowing users under a certain age to upload a profile picture yThe ability for teachers to restrict classes just to students, so no one else can drop in, even if they were forwarded an invite yAllowing teachers to retain control over who can share content We are also incorporating accessibility features to help make Webex more usable for all."
"We are conducting assessments, for example, to improve the Webex experience for students and teachers who are Deaf and hard of hearing or neurodivergent."
FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 20 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubOur work extends beyond our manufacturing suppliers into the minerals supply chain.
"While Cisco does not directly procure minerals from mines, or the smelters or refiners that process them, the company collaborates with suppliers to conduct due diligence in accordance with its Responsible Minerals Policy ."
"In fiscal 2022, 91 percent of the smelters and refiners reported by in-scope suppliers for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (3TG) were low-risk; 62 percent reported cobalt refiners were also low-risk."
"We also contributed to the RCS Global Better Mining program, which monitors working conditions at artisanal and small-scale mines in and around the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"Cisco is a member of the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM) and provides additional support to the EPRM-funded Sustainable Trade in Artisanal Gold program, which benefits miners in Burkina Faso by improving and scaling responsible sourcing tools and practices."
"Similar to its approach on minerals, Cisco employs a collaborative strategy with industry peers and stakeholders around our human rights work."
"Through these cooperative efforts, Cisco helps suppliers meet existing standards, build supplier capacity to identify and address emerging issues, and support overall engagement with rightsholders in Ciscos supply chain."
"Learn more about how our comprehensive programs identify and mitigate supply chain risks, foster supplier engagement, and catalyze greater impact in the ESG Reporting Hub ."
Within our supply chain Making the world a better place with technology begins with how that technology is made.
"We see the opportunity and responsibility in leveraging our global business, operations, and footprint to catalyze an Inclusive Future for All."
"Cisco works closely with manufacturing partners who produce our finished products, component suppliers, and logistics partners around the world."
Cisco has a comprehensive engagement strategy with suppliers that includes: ySetting policies and standards yAssessing suppliers conformance to those policies yHelping suppliers improve yImplementing targeted initiatives for specific risks and opportunities yEngaging with industry peers and stakeholders to drive global progress Cisco was one of the original founders of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and helped develop the first iteration of its Code of Conduct.
"This Code covers labor, health and safety, environment, ethics, and management systems."
"Cisco conducted RBA audits of 121 supplier sites, covering an estimated 390,000 workers in 17 countries during fiscal 2022."
"Any nonconformances that we identified are addressed in a corrective action plan for the supplier, which Cisco monitors to closure."
We work to mitigate and prevent human rights risks in our supply chain.
"This includes facilitating remediation of workers who have paid recruitment fees, which is considered a risk of bonded labor and is against Cisco policy."
"In fiscal 2022, we oversaw the return of approximately US$1.7 million to 2817 workers who had paid such fees."
We also work to build the capacity of suppliers to help prevent human rights risks.
"In fiscal 2022, Cisco trained more than 90 supplier sites on the protection of pregnant women and nursing mothers from work-related hazards."
We also trained more than 20 new supplier sites on how to implement the RBA Code of Conduct in their operations and instructed more than 60 existing suppliers on how to successfully cascade the RBA Code to their own suppliers.
Supply chain engagement can also catalyze greater worker opportunity and wellbeing.
One example is our ongoing work to implement the TenSquared program in partnership with Social Accountability International.
This program empowers workers to engage with managers on identifying and tackling persistent workplace challenges over the course of 100 working days.
"Participants in the fiscal 2022 cohort reduced workers noise exposure, lessened the likelihood of exposure to hazardous chemicals, and identified ways to work more safely on a daily basis."
"390,000 supply chain workers covered by audits conducted during fiscal 2022.FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 21 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubEthics and integrity Cisco is committed to the highest standards of ethics and integrity in all of our business dealings."
"We consistently uphold strong values and strive to make the right choices in how we conduct business, which helps us earn the trust of our customers, governments, and stakeholders around the world."
These values and our expectations of employees are captured in Ciscos Code of Business Conduct (COBC) .
"The COBC is refreshed annually to keep pace with the dynamic compliance environment and work practices, and reflects the speak up culture Cisco fosters where employees at all levels can share any concerns without fear of retaliation."
"If an employee identifies a concern or has a question that the COBC doesnt answer, we encourage them to reach out to the Ethics Office, their human resources representative, a member of the Legal team, or their manager."
"Increasingly, we are focused on extending our ethical culture to our partner network, encouraging partners to use the Ethics Line to raise questions or report potential ethics violations."
Information about reporting concerns to our Ethics Office is available on the ESG Reporting Hub .
Ciscos compliance and ethics organization regularly reports all cases and allegations of ethical violations to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and to the Compliance Steering Committee (comprised of Cisco Executive leaders).
"In fiscal 2022, we saw an increase in inquiries made to the Ethics Office, including a significant increase in questions submitted to the Ethics Line."
We believe this increase is an indication of trust in our ethical culture.
Our impact Updating ethics training We are constantly seeking new ways to connect with employees around Ciscos ethics policies and expectations.
"In fiscal 2022, we enhanced our training on anti-corruption and bribery covering related laws and their impacts, how to respond when faced with challenges, and how to report violations."
"We continue to share scrubbed cases, or real-life examples of violations that have taken place within the company, with identifying details removed, to help bring ethics concepts to life."

"Yet today, about half of the worlds population remains unconnected."
"Powering an Inclusive Future for All means addressing the barriers that keep people from accessing the Internet, including cost, skills gaps, and lack of networking infrastructure."
But access is just the beginning.
"Once people are connected to the Internet, we want to create an experience that helps meet their needs."
"We are making improvements across our product portfolio to help ensure more people are not only connected, but also have trust in digital solutions with product features that set them up for success."
"Our impact Unlocking the value of digitization Since 2015, Cisco has collaborated with government leaders, industry, and academia to support the delivery of national digital agendas through the Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program."
"Over the last two years the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies; however, it has also highlighted the stark digital divide that exists across society and within different socioeconomic groups."
"Through CDA, we are supporting countries to embrace digital and deliver connected and inclusive societies."
"To date, CDA has over 1100 active or completed projects in 44 countries."
"For example: yIn South Africa, we are expanding Cisco Experience, Design, Go-to-Market, Earn (EDGE) Centers."
"EDGE Centers function as incubators for business knowledge, speed up entry to market, and ultimately create new jobs for the local economy."
"They provide small- and medium-sized businesses with state-of-the-art Cisco communication and collaboration technology, as well as training and enablement programs to support the growth of local businesses."
"yDespite strong privacy and cybercrime laws, Italy is one of the worlds top targets of cyber attacks."
Cisco established a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity co-innovation center in Milan.
"The center will promote research and innovation, train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals, and create a local innovation ecosystem."
"yIn Switzerland, the region of Jura is making e-government services accessible to citizens, particularly those who have never used e-services before or cant easily access them from home."
Cisco has partnered with local leaders to deploy two interactive kiosks in the town of Porrentruy to help ensure all citizens have access to the services they need.
yCitizens in remote and rural regions in Mexico have limited access to specialist medical consultants.
"Cisco partnered with Medica Sur, a private healthcare group, to pilot Doctor in a Box, a mobile medical kit that can be deployed in isolated parts of the country."
"By making digital patient services mobile, we have expanded the medical coverage of one of Mexicos most advanced hospitals."
"Inclusion by design in Cisco products As a collaboration platform, Webex offers multiple ways for people to connect."
We continue to invest in and develop more inclusive features for this portfolio of products.
"For example, Webex Control Hub, which provides real-time analytics for all Webex services, uses a color palette that provides accessibility for colorblind users."
High-contrast features in the Webex app and meeting platform make work easier for low-vision users.
"Real-time closed captioning and translation into over 100 languages during meetings helps those with language or auditory barriers, leading to greater participation and retention, especially when Webex is used for remote learning."

"But even in places where broadband exists, there are regions where large portions of the population experience the digital divide."
These broadband deserts are home to 82% of the countrys historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).
"Lack of connectivity has implications for peoples ability to seek education and employment, access healthcare, and connect with others."
"To address this disparityand as part of our Social Justice Action 8: Commit to HCBUs , Cisco is installing broadband service on the campus of Claflin University in Orangeburg, South Carolina."
The installations location makes for an outsize benefit.
"Not only is South Carolina one of the states with the highest number of households without broadband access, Claflin is located right next to South Carolina State University, another HBCU."
The new equipment will provide connectivity to both universities and will extend nearly two miles into the surrounding community.
"Once complete, this pilot may serve as a model for other HBCUs that do not have access to government funding."
"Cisco is fully funding the Claflin installation, and the Student Freedom Initiative is providing support to extend this work to other colleges and universities."

"Through this initiative we have hired 75 AA/B individuals as project managers, engineers, technicians, and more."
Our hiring rate is almost double the percentage of available talent within the marketplacea clear indicator of the momentum we are gaining.
"Weve also continued to expand the ways we support career advancement, both within and beyond our company."
"Five years ago, we launched The Multiplier E ffect (TME), a program leveraging the power of sponsorship to change the equation for diversity."
Leaders pledge to sponsor at least one extraordinary person different from themselves for career advancement and to challenge their peers to do the same.
"To date, 2446 sponsors and 3761 sponsees have participated."
"The benefits of the program go both ways, as data indicates that TME sponsors and sponsees alike are more likely to be promoted than others at Cisco."
"Our Social Justice Action 6, Connect Leaders and Employees, was created to drive engagement and accelerate the impact of TME."

"For example, our Proximity Initiative challenges leaders and teams to share stories, engage in courageous conversations, and work together to weave inclusive behaviors into every part of the business."
Proximity Meetingsone-on-one dialogues between leaders and employees from across the full spectrum of diversityare central to the initiative.
"In fiscal 2022, we expanded a coaching program designed to build on the insights of the dialogues, deepen understanding, and drive inclusive leadership."
Over 300 leaders at the vice president level and above have participated in the program since its inception in fiscal 2019.
Creating a more seamless connection with Cisco Global Inclusive Communities has also been a critical success factor in creating proximity.
"In fiscal 2022, they drove participation for more than 700 Proximity Meetings."
Ciscos Global Inclusive Communities also play a critical role in driving social justice.
"In fiscal 2022, they transformed our annual Social Justice Week into a year-round Social Justice Movement."
"Communities lead monthly events featuring guest speakers, panel discussions, and personal testimonials designed to drive awareness and create a sense of belonging."
"Expanding impact across our ecosystem Expanding diversity, equity, and inclusion across our ecosystem of partners and suppliers is part of Powering an Inclusive Future for All."
We requested our preferred suppliers that provide over 50 contingent workers to Cisco to track and then aggregately report diversity.
"In return, we are sharing our innovations and successful solutions aimed at accelerating diversity."
"In fiscal 2022, we began discussing how we could share our highly effective Building Skills for a Conscious Culture training with key suppliers."
"Cisco continues to invest in our Supplier Diversity Executive Sponsorship Program, which pairs diverse suppliers with Cisco executives for regular coaching and feedback and curriculum sessions where suppliers learn more about Ciscos supplier environment and priorities."
"To date, 56 executives from the United States, United Kingdom, and India have completed this program."
"Ciscos contingent workforce: Employees of our nonmanufacturing suppliers, also known as contingent workers, make up our extended workforce."
"We track not only diversity in ownership of our supplier community, but also the diversity of preferred suppliers employees that directly support Cisco."

"This includes providing people with the collaboration tools they need to do their jobs effectively, teaching leaders how to engage in hybrid work, and reimagining our offices as safe, secure places to collaborate."
Listening to employees remains an important part of every decision we make.
Outreach in the form of our quarterly Real Deal surveys gives people the opportunity to share whats working for themand whats not so that we can make improvements that keep everyone engaged.
Our impact Scaling up My Onboarding Journey Any employees first months at Cisco set the tone for the rest of their time here.
"In fiscal 2022, we launched My Onboarding Journey (MOJ), a new program for all full-time hires."
"The program includes connection points during an employees first week and after 30, 60, and 90 days, where they get connections to benefits and resources, introductions to Cisco Global Inclusive Communities, and ways to build their skills and give back to communities."
"Recently, we enhanced the program by offering more intimate breakout sessions, translating content into local languages, and organizing events for MOJ alumni."
"Because the program was created during the pandemic, we are now working on adding in-person components through which new hires can further make connections and experience Ciscos cross-functional collaboration culture."
"Illuminating career possibilities Through employee feedback, weve learned that there is a strong appetite for virtual resources that people can use to grow their careersand that people need dedicated time to focus on learning and development."
"Based on these insights, in fiscal 2022 we launched Cisco Illuminate, an ongoing program of quarterly learning experiences connecting employees with the relevant people, information, and skills to move forward with confidence."
"Each quarter, we focus on a different topic (Your Learning, Your Leadership, Your Career, Your Team)."
"Illuminate Your Leadership, for example, brought together internal and external speakers who shared examples, best practices, and simple actions leaders can take to engage their teams."

FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 32 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubEmployee community impact Encouraging Cisco employees to contribute to their local and global communities is one way we bring our purpose to life.
"In fiscal 2022, for the third year in a row, we maintained over 80 percent employee participation in community impact."
"We measure impact by employees actions, including advocating for causes they care about; environmental sustainability actions; hybrid volunteering (virtual and in-person); donating; digital give-back experiences; survey sharing; and participating in programs that positively impact people, society, and the planet."
"The fact that we have engaged four out of every five Cisco employees, representing 95 countries, for the past three years even throughout a global pandemicis proof of a purpose-driven culture where small acts of kindness can add up to incredible impact."
"Principles of behavioral science and economics and data-forward insights drive our strategy and allow all employees to contribute, no matter where they are."
"For example, we use nudges like giving all new hires a credit to donate to a nonprofit of their choice and integrating easy give-back actions into digital spaces, meetings, and business events."
"Now, we are leveraging the power of Leading in community impact Since fiscal 2020, weve achieved:Visit Ciscos ESG Reporting Hub for more information on employee community impact."

Our climate goals Scientific consensus says that we must quickly reduce GHG emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
"Cisco has been setting and achieving five-year GHG reduction goals since 2008, and recently announced our most ambitious goal yet."
"Last fiscal year, Cisco set a goal to reach net zero across its value chain (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) by 2040."
"Our net-zero goal includes two near-term targets: yTo reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 90 percent1 by fiscal 2025 compared to our 2019 fiscal year yTo reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution, and use of sold products 30 percent by fiscal 2030 compared to our 2019 fiscal year2 Fiscal 2022 is our first year reporting progress toward this goal and our two near-term targets."
"In July 2022, our goal was approved by the SBTi under its new Net-Zero Standard."
"This standard provides a consistent approach for setting net- zero targets that are aligned with climate science, specifically the need to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C above preindustrial levels."
Cisco is among the first technology hardware and equipment companies to have its net-zero goal validated under the SBTi Net-Zero Standard.
"In addition, Cisco joined SBTis Business Ambition for 1.5C campaign , which drives the adoption of robust emissions reduction targets at the pace and scale required by climate science."

"When designing new products, power and performance mean a constant tradeoff."
"To reduce the emissions associated with the use of our products, we are making improvements in four key areas: power; thermal; high-speed interconnects and ASICs; and integration into our customer facilities (read more in the ESG Reporting Hub )."
"In fiscal 2022, we completed our energy efficiency goal, achieving 87 percent system power efficiency in our large rack-mounted equipment, as measured from the input power from the facility to the board-mounted ASICs, memory, and other chip devices."
"We reached this goal by focusing on three of our four areas for improvement, including using high-efficiency power supplies, optimizing ASIC power distribution, and optimizing system power distribution."
"To accelerate the decarbonization of our value chain and help our customers achieve their own sustainability goals, we created a new Engineering Sustainability Office in fiscal 2022."
"This group works across Ciscos engineering teams and in partnership with other functions to design sustainable products, offers, and solutions, guided by one roadmap with measurable results."
Sustainable data centers Data centers require ongoing energy management to handle vast amounts of data.
"In Cisco lab tests, the new Nexus 9800 series switches, built using modular design and both 80 Plus Titanium-rated and Platinum-rated power supplies, were shown to be 1.6 times more efficient than the 400G GX-based Nexus 9500 series."
"Hybrid work Webex is our integrated solution that creates safe, secure, and supportive places to work."
"The entire product lifecycle of a Webex Desk Pro, from production through five years of use independent of location, is offset by avoiding emissions associated with one person traveling on a long-haul flight."
"Smart buildings Cisco Meraki delivers energy savings, asset tracking, and remote IT management."
"When smart IoT sensors are connected within buildings and run on low-voltage Power over Ethernet cables, we can use data to control building operations at a much more granular level and use less power."
Three areas in which we are driving innovation:Purpose Personified: Its constant internal innovation to ensure that were balancing power and performance.
One example of searching for that innovation within the internal team is a Net Zero Challenge we held where we asked anyone within CHG to brainstorm ideas for energy efficiency and ways to reduce power needs.

More countries are making plans to phase out gas-powered vehiclesand more consumers are ready to start driving electric.
But power grids may not be prepared for demand from millions of electric vehicles (EVs) trying to charge at the same time.
"Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies could help reduce pressure on electricity grids, especially during peak charging times."
These technologies would treat every EV like a battery that can supply power back to a network or building.
"For now, V2G is just a conceptbut a recent Cisco partnership is helping bring it closer to commercial reality."
"The E-Flex projecta joint initiative between Ciscos Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program, Imperial College London, and other partnersis proving the potential of V2G with fleets of vehicles owned by public and private-sector organizations."
Twenty locations around the United Kingdom were outfitted with two-way charging stations from which data was collected.
"As a lead partner on the project, Cisco provided secure connectivity at the charging stations through its Umbrella cloud security solution, and Cisco Meraki cameras added to physical security."
"If it proves successful at scale, V2G could become a critical part of a lower-carbon future, as well as helping energy managers reduce operational costs."
This project provided a glimpse of what that future could look like.
"Vehicles can act as local energy storage alongside renewables, says Peter Shearman, Cisco Head of Innovation, United Kingdom and Ireland."
V2G technology could be deployed at smart buildings or business parks with their own renewable microgrids.
This could help with fluctuations in renewable energy generation and move smart buildings closer to net zero.
"Powering an EV-ready grid FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 48 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubIn fiscal 2022, implemented 34 energy efficiency projects that avoid approximately 14.5 GWh of energy consumption and 8000 metric tonne CO2e annually Focus on our facilities and direct operations We are committed to embedding environmental sustainability into operations in part by creating and maintaining workplaces that support our employees wellbeing and productivity."
"Through our hybrid work strategy , we are embedding sustainable building practices and standards into the design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities."
"Our shift toward hybrid work at Cisco includes investing in collaboration hubs and, in some cases, reducing leased and owned office spaces to reinvest in other priority areas."
"From August 2017 through the end of fiscal 2022, we have reduced our real estate square footage by 16 percent."
"As of fiscal 2022, we have 40 Cisco facilities with green building certifications, such as U."
"S. Green Building Councils Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and International WELL Building Institutes, with five more in progress."
These certified spaces make up 22 percent of our building portfolio.
"The retrofit of our office space at Penn 1 in New York City combines sustainable building principles, Cisco collaboration technology, and hybrid work principles to create an intuitive and inviting workspace."
"Were also working to make our global data centers more sustainable by focusing on sustainable design, optimized operations, energy management, asset recovery and reuse, and responsible procurement."
"Since 2016, weve reduced our data center power consumption by 40 percent, significantly increased internal reuse of equipment, and reduced our facility data center costs by 23 percent."
Weve been developing and executing initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of our facilities for more than 15 years.
Cisco operations account for only 1 percent of our total GHG emissions.
"However, we remain committed to reducing GHG emissions in our operations by procuring renewable electricity and improving the efficiency of our offices, labs, and data centers."
"From fiscal 2017 through the end of fiscal 2022, we invested approximately US$60 million to execute hundreds of energy-efficiency projects across our operations and achieved our previous goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 60 percent (compared to fiscal 2007 base year)."
"To achieve our fiscal 2025 goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions 90 percent (compared to fiscal 2019 base year), we have committed to investing an additional US$39 million from fiscal years 2023 to 2025 to continue funding efficiency, renewable energy, and electrification projects."
Increasing our use of renewable electricity is a fundamental part of our strategy.
"In fiscal 2022, 89 percent of our global electricity came from renewable energy sources, including 100 percent in the United States, Canada, and several European countries ."
"We are ramping up both our onsite and offsite renewable energy efforts, targeting approximately 5 MW of new onsite solar and securing over 500 MW of new long-term renewable energy contracts by the end of fiscal 2025."
"In India and Europe, we are actively evaluating long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) that would collectively add over 100 MW of new solar and wind developments to these regions."

"As a result, supply chain-related Scope 3 emissions make up approximately one quarter of our GHG footprint."
"Over the last several years, we have focused on shifting transport from air to ocean when possible, working with suppliers to set absolute GHG emissions reduction goals, and asking suppliers to transparently report on GHG emissions reduction progress to CDP annually."
"Accelerating the use of clean energy globally is a key lever to reducing emissions, and we need to collaborate with our customers, suppliers, and policymakers to drive progress."
We partner with organizations such as the Clean Energy Buyers Association and the U.
"S. Environmental Protection Agencys Green Power Partnership and, in fiscal 2022, began engaging our suppliers in the Asia-Pacific region on renewable energy as part of their GHG emissions reduction plans."
"We also joined, as a founding member, the Asia Clean Energy Coalition , a coalition which will convene NGOs, as well as renewable energy buyers, sellers, and financiers, focused on shifting policy and increasing corporate renewable electricity procurement in Asia."
We are actively pursuing a strategy to increase our procurement of renewable energy through long-term PPAs in the near term with a view to adding new renewable energy to the grid.

"Purpose Personified: I started to see there was something we could do about the catastrophic fire problem, as long as we had the right information and worked together across jurisdictions, inclusive of different perspectives."
I observed how data was gathered and planning was done.
I saw a way to modernize and improve collaborative planning and democratize access to the best possible science.
"Once I saw what was needed, I couldnt not do it."
"Allison Wolff, Co-Founder, Vibrant Planet, a Cisco Foundation funding recipientThinking beyond our business We are committed to accelerating decarbonization beyond our own footprint and that of our customers."
We have a variety of initiatives dedicated to supporting innovative climate solutions.
"A year ago, the Cisco Foundation committed to investing US$100 million over 10 years to fund climate solutions."
"At the end of fiscal 2022, the Cisco Foundation committed approximately US$11 million to early-stage solutions that are in diverse stages of development, from conceptual ideas to those that are ready for commercial deployment and widespread impact."
This blended finance approach will help address critical climate financing gaps and catalyze impact.
"Also in fiscal 2022, we launched the Cisco Digital Sustainability Challenge to reward Cisco partners, both in the United States and globally , who are using Cisco technology to help customers tackle climate concerns and achieve their own sustainability goals."
"Solutions must measurably reduce GHG emissions, waste, or energy consumption; accelerate climate innovation; and demonstrate collaboration."
Cisco introduced a new category of Climate Impact and Regeneration Prizes to the 2022 Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge.
These prizes are specifically for solutions that reduce or remove GHGs in the atmosphere or regenerate depleted ecosystems.
"In fiscal 2022 the Challenge awarded five startups a combined US$300,000 for solutions that reduce agricultural pollution, increase access to clean energy, enable sustainable fishing, and incentivize farmers to plant trees."
"Finally, we strive to assist those who experience the most severe effects of a changing climate, such as extreme weather, flooding, drought, food shortages, and population displacement, through Cisco Crisis Response ."
"Our products and solutions provide infrastructure that customers, communities, and governments can use to improve their resiliency and remain connected amid climate-related disruptions."
"ByFY25: 80% of Cisco component, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers by spend will have a public, absolute GHG emissions reduction target."
78% with targetsFUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 50 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubCircular economy Cisco works to extend the life span of our products and reduce material waste.
"We are evolving to a regenerative, circular model in which we reduce the resources we consume and the waste we generate."
"With this approach, we prioritize materials with recycled content; design products for resource efficiency; and facilitate repair, remanufacturing, and recycling to extend product life."
Customer data security is a critical part of the circular economy.
We have continued to focus on security capabilities and the removal of residual customer data from products returned to us to support repair and reuse.
"In fiscal 2021, we exceeded our goal to decrease use of virgin plastics in products by 20 percent compared to a fiscal 2018 base year."
"Building on the momentum and key learnings from this goal, we recently set a new goal that by our fiscal 2025, 50 percent of the plastic used in our products (by weight) will be made of recycled content."
Circular economy goals By FY25: Reduce foam used in Cisco product packaging by 75% as measured by weight (FY19 base year).
23% reduction By FY25: Increase product packaging cube efficiency by 50% (FY19 base year).1 36% cumulative improvement By FY25: 100% of new Cisco products and packaging to incorporate Circular Design Principles.2 4% meeting circular design criteria By FY25: 50% of the plastic used in our products (by weight) will be made of recycled content.3 New goal as of FY23 : Not yet reporting By FY25: 70% of Cisco component and manufacturing suppliers by spend will achieve a zero waste diversion rate at one or more sites.4 51% by spend with at least one certified site 1 Packaging efficiency is measured by comparing the size of the product relative to the packaging using dimensional weight.
Dimensional weight uses volume and a standard dimensional factor to calculate the weight of a package.
"In this methodology, the packaging efficiency metric is based on the difference of the normalized dimensional weight (by volume) between the baseline and current year."
"2 In fiscal 2022, we had a soft launch of the scoring tool to evaluate 13 percent of new products and packaging, and 33 percent of them successfully met our circular design criteria."
This is equivalent to 4 percent of total new products and packaging released in fiscal 2022 meeting circular design criteria.
"In early fiscal 2023, the scoring tool was formally launched across all business units, so we expect the universe of new products and packaging evaluated to increase in fiscal 2023."
"3 The plastics included in this goal exclude those contained in commodity components sourced from suppliers (e.g., plastic screws, fans, and cables)."
"4 According to current standard definitions used in certification protocols, zero waste diversion is defined as a 90 percent or greater overall diversion of solid, nonhazardous wastes from landfill, incineration (waste-to-energy), and the environment."
"Diversion methods can include reduction, reuse, recycling, and/or compost."

"FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 51 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubOur impact Applying circular design thinking Circular design means designing products and systems that enable reuse, minimize environmental impact and resource use, drive innovation, and realize value for our stakeholders."
"In fiscal 2021, we launched a design evaluation methodology to help us track progress toward our circular design goal."
"In the initial year of using this methodology, 13 percent of new product and packaging designs were evaluated and scored against that methodology, 33 percent of which met our circular design criteria."
We are taking steps to further embed the evaluation process into the product development lifecycle.
"For example, Ciscos NCS1K product family consists of controller cards, optical interfaces, fan trays, and power supplies."
"Given the complexity of this system, thoughtful design for circularity is crucial."
"The NCS1K team developed the device for multiple, extended lifecycles with redundant fans (one can be repaired while the other runs), easily replaceable modules, and a working hours counter that provides refurbishers with runtime data."
One of Ciscos circular design focus areas is packaging and accessories.
"We are taking a close look at what accessories we can remove from standard configurations, and reducing our use of virgin plastics wherever possible."
"Recent innovations and their impacts in fiscal 2022 include: yFor many product lines, we have replaced plastic with more sustainable materials, including recycled paperboard and wax paper, and for power cords, we replaced plastic bags with scannable wraps 4M Meraki accessories shipped in paper-based packaging made of 70% recycled content yTo reduce the volume of unused accessories and avoid waste, we added a no power cord option to thousands of product configurations and also eliminated the disposable electrostatic discharge strap from the accessory kit for our enterprise products 205,000 power cord shipments and associated packaging avoided yFor several product lines, we replaced foam packaging, another plastic-based material, with more sustainable alternatives, the packaging for the Catalyst IR8140 Heavy Duty Router being the first solution at Cisco to use a fiber-flute material in place of the foam cushioning typically required for heavier products 37,273 pounds of foam reduced across Cisco products yWith the aim of decreasing overall material use, we reduced the use of corrugate in our packaging through several initiatives, including the shipment of products in multipack packaging and the removal of unused accessories and their associated packaging >700,000 pounds of corrugate reduced, equivalent to >1 million pizza boxes Embedding circularity from sale through product reuse We know we have an important role to play in how our customers are meeting their own sustainability goals."
Customers are increasingly considering as-a-service models and want to extend the lifecycle of their equipment.
"In fiscal 2022, Cisco Capital launched Cisco Green Pay , a payment solution that makes it easier for customers to build a sustainable technology strategy to reach their ESG goals."
It provides a path for customers of all sizes to acquire Cisco sustainable solutions.
"The program offers predictable payments for five years, with a 5 percent incentive on equipment at the outset, while Cisco retains ownership."
"Our other long-standing programs focused on return and reuse, including our remanufactured products offered through Cisco Refresh , help contribute to our customers meeting their sustainability goals, while also helping us make progress towards our PACE Capital Equipment Pledge."
"FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 52 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubTaking advantage of the specialization and helping our customers with ways to participate in the circular economy has been a boost to our business initially, and I see it being a big part as we go forward as well."
"John Samz Senior Vice President Cisco Channel Alliance, Core BTSIncluding Cisco partners in our circular journey Ciscos customer base is supported by a vast partner ecosystem worldwide."
"In fiscal 2022, we focused on empowering this community to advance sustainability conversations with our customers."
"We launched the Environmental Sustainability Specialization (ESS) , a new business specialization available to all Cisco partners."
"The specialization recognizes partners for supporting Ciscos sustainability initiatives and equips them to educate customers, promote product takeback, assist in customers move to circular business models, and further their own sustainability practices."
One benefit ESS partners can share with customers is our new Takeback Incentivean incremental discount of up to 7 percent on new products with a commitment to return used hardware back to Cisco.
"FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 53 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubEnvironmental stewardship Environmental issues such as climate change, pollution, and waste disproportionately affect disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, who are often less resilient to their consequences."
"These issues can create humanitarian crises and also cause disruptions for businesses, electrical grids, and water supplies."
"Cisco strives to be a force for positive change, sharing best practices for sustainable resource stewardship and engaging with vulnerable workers and communities to help protect the vibrancy of human rights and the environment."
Our impact Reducing water use worldwide Cisco does not use significant amounts of water in our direct operations.
"All the same, we are committed to reducing water consumption as much as we can in our operations and supply chain."
"In Ciscos supply chain, water is both an environmental and human rights issue, because suppliers operating in water-stressed areas must balance their needs with those of the surrounding communities."
"Cisco requires its top suppliers by spend to set and report on water usage targets, as well as to complete the CDP water security questionnaire."
"In fiscal 2022, Cisco worked with eight component suppliers to use a water checklist developed in partnership with the Alliance for Water Stewardship to set water usage baselines and improvement plans."
Cisco has an ongoing partnership with the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) to prevent and mitigate environmental risks from supplier sites in mainland China.
"IPE has recognized Ciscos work on its Green Supply Chain, and Cisco ranked first in the IT industry for the Corporate Information Transparency Index at the end of fiscal 2022.We report our operational water use and risks in our CDP water security questionnaire and our ESG Reporting Hub ."
"To limit our impact, we prioritize water management projects at sites in water-stressed locations."
"For example, we maintain a comprehensive water management system at our campus in Bangalore, India."
"The campus is a zero-discharge facility, meaning no wastewater is discharged to third parties or the environment."
Discharged water is sent to two recently upgraded sewage treatment plants.
"The treated water is used on campus in an evaporative cooling system, for landscaping irrigation, and for toilet flushing."

"FUTURE INTRO POWER INCLUSIVE 54 2022 Cisco Purpose Report | csr.cisco.com | ESG Reporting HubProgress on waste Cisco works to reduce the amount of waste we produce through reuse, recycling, composting, and donations."
"In fiscal 2022, we diverted 75 percent of our operational waste from landfill."
We have a variety of initiatives for ISO 14000-certified sites.
We also have programs to reuse and recycle e-scrap within our direct operations.
"Our headquarters in San Jose, California, continues to maintain a robust waste diversion program and diverted 88 percent of total waste from landfill in fiscal 2022."
"Occupancy is still low in our offices due to the global shift toward hybrid work, which impacts our ability to implement some waste-reduction activities."
"Of course, with fewer employees working in offices, we produce significantly less waste at our campuses, and therefore divert less as well."
Cisco also engages suppliers on waste.
We have a goal that our manufacturing and component suppliers will achieve a zero-waste diversion rate at one or more sites by fiscal 2025.
"For details on fiscal 2022 progress toward our supplier waste diversion goal for fiscal 2025, see our ESG Reporting Hub ."
"Protecting habitat and species Cisco recognizes that climate change and environmental degradation can accelerate habitat loss, which in turn accelerates the impacts of climate change by undermining natural defenses against extreme weather, like forests and coastline ecosystems."
We are committed to doing our part to protect the natural world and its species in our own operations and beyond.
"Since 2015, Cisco surveillance, data, and analytics technology have been used to protect endangered species around the world through Connected Conservation the first solution of its kind to proactively protect animals while leaving them to roam freely."
"In fiscal 2022, Connected Conservation added 3 million hectares for a total of 5 million hectares of wilderness connected and secured across Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia."
Nine wilderness reserves are now equipped with technology to gather real-time data enabling analysis that can support ongoing research and innovation related to wildlife protection.
