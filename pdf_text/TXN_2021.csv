"We designed our long-term environmental sustainability program to conserve natural resources, reduce emissions and mitigate environmental impacts."
"We have had a long-standing commitment to responsible, sustainable manufacturing."
Our focus is on; improving energy efficiency; reducing GHG emissions; reducing waste; and reusing more water.
Specifics on these areas can be found in the following pages.
"Progress As part of TIs commitment to reducing environmental impact, TI sets goals to reduce GHG emissions, energy intensity per chip, waste and increased water conservation."
"Over the past several years, TI has made progress towards our long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and scope 2 absolute GHG emissions by 25% from a 2015 base year and will continue working towards the successful achievement of this goal by 2025."
"In 2021 TIs production increased by ~20% compared to the prior year, due to high customer demand from the ongoing global challenges related to the pandemic and resulting supply chain disruptions."
"While we had year-over-year increases in key areas, they did not increase at the same rate as production."
"We remain committed to achieving our 2025 GHG emissions and energy intensity goals, and are investing in the actions listed within the report to reduce our environmental impact."
"As a semiconductor company that manufactures billions of chips per year, we believe it is critical to drive efficiencies in our fabrication process."
Measuring per chip improvements tells the greater story in our efforts to improve overall efficiency.
"On page 7, we include an overview of our actions, goals and progress in four key areas of environmental sustainability - GHG emissions, energy, water and waste and we include an overview of the per chip efficiencies weve recognized over the past 11 years."
"As we continue to expand our 300-millimeter (300-mm) manufacturing, and the advanced manufacturing technology in these wafer manufacturing plants, the efficiencies recognized will continue to positively impact our environmental footprint."

We measure GHG emissions intensity to assess the overall GHG efficiency of our manufacturing processes.
"GHG emissions refer to the total GHGs emitted, which depend on the amount of production."
GHG emissions intensity attempts to normalize usage by looking at GHG emissions per unit of output (by dividing our total GHG emissions by our total production).
This same definition applies to water and waste intensity per chip data.
"To minimize environmental impacts, TI implements strategies to reduce water consumption, waste and greenhouse gas emissions."
These are summarized below along with the progress we are making towards our reduction goals.
"6TIs 2015 GHG emissions baseline was adjusted in 2022 to reflect structural changes to our operations, including the divestiture of a wafer fabrication plant in Scotland and the acquisition of a 300-mm wafer fabrication plant in Utah."

Step 2: Reuse what we can.
"We reuse materials and chemicals by: Recovering metals from solids, liquids, scrap wafers and other materials."
"Repurposing and reselling used and surplus chemicals, chemical containers and older manufacturing equipment."
Reusing wafer carriers and food service tableware.
Step 3: Recycle what is allowed.
Our recyclable material and chemicals come primarily from our offices and manufacturing sites.
These are managed and regulated differently depending on local requirements.
"Managing chemicals and gas use Manufacturing semiconductors involves using hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals and gases, which is why TIs product-management systems have stringent controls in place."
"We continually: Identify and use the safest, lowest-risk materials in operations to protect TIers, site communities and consumers."
"Where possible, we use high-pressure water instead of chemicals in certain cleanup applications or replace chemicals with environmentally benign substitutes."
Screen all incoming materials and chemicals before incorporating them into semiconductor manufacturing processes to comply with regulatory and customer requirements.
We also incorporate any chemical restrictions and standards into supplier contracts.
Assess potential ESH impacts of materials as new scientific information becomes available and new regulations go into effect.
"Follow strict standards and protocols for responsibly purchasing, transporting, tracking and disposing of chemicals safely."
"Provide specific procedures and training for the use, labeling, storage and disposal of chemicals or hazardous substances, including the proper use of personal protective equipment."
"Use ventilation controls, abatement systems, leak detectors and appropriate treatment technologies."
"If concerns about a material or chemical arise during our screening process, we elevate the matter to our review board, comprising internal subject-matter experts."
"In the rare event that a material or chemical is necessary for manufacturing but still raises concerns, our manufacturing leaders review the situation and, if necessary, seek a safer alternative or implement more stringent use controls."
"Performance TI reused or recycled 90.1% of the 45,667 metric tons of waste and surplus materials generated in 2021."
"We achieved this through reusing and recovering chemicals where viable; selling surplus chemicals; recycling certain wastes for use in energy recovery; and recycling scrap wood, paper, glass, metals and organic materials.15 Texas Instruments 2022 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report TABLE OF CONTENTS CEO LETTER TI AT A GLANCE OUR COMMITMENT RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES WORKPLACE GIVING & VOLUNTEERING APPENDICES ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Phasing out substances of concern One challenge facing the electronics industry is reducing or eliminating the use of compounds that are essential but potentially harmful."
"These include: Brominated and chlorinated flame retardants while these compounds pose no risk in TI products as sold, their improper or unsafe disposal is of concern."
"Over the last two decades, weve proactively removed these chemicals from 99% of our products."
Perfluorinated substances (PFOSs) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) these oil and water repellants cause potential health effects.

The journey started in 1989 with the womens and Hispanic/Latino/x ERGs.
All TI ERGs have goals and objectives that align with and support our company values and business objectives.
"A team of employees lead each ERG, with at least one TI executive sponsor."
"ERGs hosted hundreds of programs, panels and events in 2021 that engaged TIers in many ways."
For example: The Black Employee Network formed a Black Engineering Collective to support TIers who aspire to the TI Tech Ladder and build their technical leadership skills.
"They also hosted programs to build awareness about the significance of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Juneteenth and the impact of colorism."
The Chinese Heritage Network collaborated with the Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum to raise awareness and combat anti-Asian violence.
"The Pride network launched an on-demand course that provides TIers around the world foundational knowledge on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, pronouns usage and important, and simple tips for promoting LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion as an ally."
"For more information about how TI champions diversity and inclusion, see Diversity and Equal Opportunity in the GRI Index."
"Conversations that matter One of the ways that TI is co-creating an inclusive culture is through regular group-based dialogue teams with Catalyst, a global nonprofit that helps to build better workplaces for a diverse wokforce."
"The goal of these dialogue teams is to build self- awareness by learning to identify both personal and systemic barriers to inclusion, and how to interrupt exclusionary behaviors and challenge stereotypes."
"The sessions encourage candid, constructive dialogue with employees across all levels, from all backgrounds."
In this way we are encouraging employees and leaders to share their experiences and bring their own courageous conversations to conference rooms across the company.
"Our commitment to an inclusive environment We are focused on reducing bias within our processes when interviewing candidates, reviewing job performance, and making compensation and advancement decisions by: Requiring our hiring and development managers to complete unconscious bias training."
Making unconscious bias content available in performance management workshops and directly to TIers through our learning and development system.
Training leaders how to understand and recognize unconscious bias before conducting talent reviews.
"For example, leaders use specific and objective criteria to assess professional growth and gather independent feedback from multiple sources when assessing job performance."

"Liz, a planning manager in one of our 300-mm wafer fabs, was inspired to join the Army by her family who has been in the military for generations."
"After the Army, she interviewed at one of our wafer fabrication plants in Dallas."
Liz reflected on how TI and the military have a similar way of approaching challenges: Both focus on working the problem and relying on a team to create a solution.
The military and TI have taught me about leadership and understanding that sometimes you have to put the needs and goals of your team ahead of yourself.
"As a TIer, veteran and working mom, I draw on the lessons I learned in the Army about integrity, duty, honor and respect."

WFTL has helped increase the number women elected to TIs Tech Ladder by nearly 50% since its formation in 2016.
"When Women for Technical Leadership was formed in 2016, we were seeing women participate in elections at roughly half the rate of men, said Yesenia Moore, vice president of diversity and inclusion."
We have seen marked improvement in the participation rates of women in the Tech Ladder election over the past five years.
This is encouraging for progress yet to come.
"Amos Tang, a member of the 2021 cohort, was recently elected to the Tech Ladder and looks forward to inspiring other women to apply."
"The training sessions and roundtables with leadership gave me a new perspective as a technical leader, she said."
"This program is about self-confidence, how we express ourselves and how we connect with others."
It also inspires us to continue mentoring and advocating to lead others to succeed.
Kiki Schuck participated in WFTL and was elected to Tech Ladder early in her career.
"She said, Participating in WFTL and being elected to the Tech Ladder helped me to find my voice and have more confidence."
"Having this recognition from my peers and being elected into this group of technologists gave me self-confidence as I approach new opportunities, solve problems and innovate."
"Kiki Schuck, TI Tech Ladder and WFTL member37 Texas Instruments 2022 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report TABLE OF CONTENTS CEO LETTER TI AT A GLANCE OUR COMMITMENT RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES WORKPLACE GIVING & VOLUNTEERING APPENDICES ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Compensation and benefits We offer competitive compensation designed to ensure that our most talented employees, who will drive future growth, will remain at TI."
Our compensation philosophy is based on pay for performance.
Both the employees contribution to TIs success and company performance determine an individuals compensation.
One of the unique aspects of TIs compensation strategy is a global profit-sharing program that rewards all TIers18 for contributions to the companys financial success.
TI makes payouts as a percentage of eligible earnings based on profitability each year.
Our profit-sharing formula is based on profit from operations (PFO) and begins when TI reaches 10% PFO.
"The maximum payout is 20%, when PFO reaches 35%."
All TIers receive a payout based on the same percentage of eligible earnings.
"Our profit-sharing plan has paid out at the maximum level possible for the last six years, equating to a 20% bonus for all eligible employees."
"For more information about how TI manages compensation, see the Market Presence and Nondiscrimination sections and indicators 202-1, 405-1 and 405-5 in the GRI Index."
Our commitment to equitable pay We pay our employees fairly and equitably.
"TI has had competitive and equitable compensation policies regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other protected characteristics, and we have designed checks and balances into our compensation system, including regular in-depth analyses, to ensure that we achieve it."
"In 2021, we conducted a separate compensation analysis examining gender and race pay parity (including base, and bonus pay and equity), that considered job type, job level and country."
Our analysis confirmed that within the U.
"S. and worldwide, TI pays women as much as men, and in the U."
"S., TI pays minorities as much as non-minorities."
"18 Some countries, such as France and Mexico, have statutory requirements for their local profit-sharing programs."
Employees receive bonuses in accordance with those requirements.
"Competitive compensation and benefits Retaining employees with institutional knowledge, technical and operating expertise, and relationships is a top priority for TI."
We also recognize that retaining women and underrepresented minorities is critical.
TI takes a multidisciplinary approach to retention by offering: Competitive pay and benefits.
"Tailored career development plans, mentoring programs and executive interaction to develop and encourage professional growth."
Connection to peers through our ERGs.
Unlimited opportunities to refine skills.
"We also offer and encourage employees to take full advantage of various programs to reduce daily stressors that can interfere with well-being, workplace satisfaction and productivity, such as: Flexible work arrangements."
"Concierge services for vacation planning, making reservations or other personal transactions."
On-demand resources and referrals for child care and elder care through our Employee Assistance program.

"Indicator Description Response 102-8Number of employees and workers by age, gender and typeSee employee data in the Workplace section of TIs 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report."
TI does not track the number of employees by employment contract and its part-time workforce is negligible.
Full-time employees perform the majority of work and are supported by supplemental contractors when needed (supplemental contractors receive daily work instruction from TI managers).
The number of these contractors varies throughout the year.
"102-9 Supply-chain descriptionSee the Supply-Chain Responsibility section in TIs 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report, Anti-Human Trafficking Statement and our supplier website for more information about our supply chain."
"We spend roughly 80% of procurement dollars with approximately 300 suppliers, of which about 180 are critical to supporting semiconductor manufacturing."
We define critical suppliers as those essential to the supply strategy of a category procurement team that could cause a major disruption to be manufacturing or design output.
"When needed, we outsource the manufacturing of wafers or product assembly and testing."
"102-10Significant changes to the organization and its supply chainOver the past several years, we have invested in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships."
"Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design."
"For example, in 2021, about two-thirds of our revenue was direct, and transactions on TI.com grew to about 10% of our revenue as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online."
"Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs."
"We expanded the reach of our TI.com e-commerce channel by offering a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record."
"For more information, see SEC form 10-K , Part I, Item 1, pages 6-7."
