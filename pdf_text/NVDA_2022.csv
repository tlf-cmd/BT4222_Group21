We also encourage them to use the RBA Code as a platform to go above and beyond compliance.
"Our assessment process involves using the RBA online system to evaluate existing and potential new suppliers against product compliance industry standards, social and environmental criteria, use of conflict minerals, the RBA Code, and NVIDIAs code of conduct."
"We use the results of our assessment process, along with a spending analysis, to rank suppliers to determine their overall risk."
"Strategic suppliers include those who produce or handle NVIDIA production materials, those for whom we closely manage quality requirements (non-critical suppliers), those who design our branded products, and those who were required to work with based on customer agreements."
"For strategic suppliers, agreements are deployed and tracked through a quarterly business review (QBR) process to make certain that they uphold our requirements."
QBR performance influences our business allocation decisions.
"Each quarter, we review overall supplier assessment by product category and rank performance."
"Five of 100 QBR points are allocated to environmental or social performance, and requirements vary by quarter."
Suppliers are required to meet industry compliance requirements as well as NVIDIA requirements.
Weve assessed and adjusted business with suppliers who dont comply with minimum requirements.
"In FY20, we reviewed all strategic suppliers against NVIDIA cybersecurity requirements, and in FY21, we performed a more in-depth assessment of higher-risk suppliers."
"We looked at our suppliers conformance to ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TPAT standards, and evaluated them for additional information, product, and physical security requirements."
"Depending on the results of the assessment, we require additional evidence of conformance or an improvement plan if gaps are discovered."
We began using Bitsight in FY22 to provide continuous monitoring of cybersecurity risks in our supply chain.
"Suppliers are reviewed on a variety of topics and receive a low-, moderate-, or high-risk rating, which we then use to implement improvements."
"Moving forward, we plan to continue periodic assessments and continuous monitoring."
