"25ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY INTRODUCTION COMMUNITY IMPACT EQUALITY & INCLUSION ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ETHICS & CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY RECOGNITIONS & AWARDS WASTE Plastic waste in our environment is a serious problem, especially when it ends up in our rivers and oceans."
"Its a complex global challenge that requires a comprehensive, collaborative approach across the entire plastics lifecycle."
"Addressing this challenge and driving greater circularity for plastics will require collaboration across multiple stakeholders, including industry, governments, civil society and academics."
"While plastic can provide packaging material reductions, product protection, and lower greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, we must use and reuse it responsibly."
"At P&G, we are working to design all our consumer packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2030."
"We are inventing and scaling new recycling solutions, using alternative materials, and partnering externally to help catalyze waste management infrastructure to improve access to collectionkeeping plastic in use and out of nature."
"26ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY INTRODUCTION COMMUNITY IMPACT EQUALITY & INCLUSION ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ETHICS & CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY RECOGNITIONS & AWARDS WASTE GOALS AND PROGRESS Our brands, suppliers and partners continue to collaborate on a range of sustainable solutions and on driving circularity so that plastic is collected, recycled and reused."
"To track progress toward our goals, P&G considers packaging to be recyclable if there is at-scale collection, sorting, processing, and end markets for the material and format in at least one geography."
We do not consider waste to energy and conversion to fuels as suitable end markets.
"GOALS PROGRESS through June 30, 2022 100% of our consumer packaging will be designed to be recyclable or reusable by 2030~79% of our consumer packaging is designed to be recyclable or reusable Reduce our use of virgin petroleum plastic in our consumer packaging by 50% by 2030 vs. 2017 baseline~8% reduction of virgin petroleum plastic in packaging Zero manufacturing waste to landfill Achieved and maintained since 2020 Progre ss to 100% Recyclable or Reusable Packaging FY20/21 FY19/20FY21/22 73% 55%79%Types of Resin Used in Packaging PE (48.3%) PET (23.2%)PP (22.4%) Other (6.2%) We nearly doubled our use of recycled plastic over the past two years In 2021/2022, we diverted nearly 675,000 metric tons of manufacturing waste from the landfill which is heavier than 66 EIFFEL TOWERS Data and Metrics: Plastics Packaging Tons of plastic packaging 776,220 metric tons Tons of recycled plastic resin 96,469 metric tons Percent of total resin used that was recycled12.4% recycled resin 27ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY INTRODUCTION COMMUNITY IMPACT EQUALITY & INCLUSION ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ETHICS & CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY RECOGNITIONS & AWARDS Reducing Plastic Packaging Gillette and Venus undertook a sustainable packaging upgrade to transition premium refillable razor packs to a plastic-free, recyclable cardboard box made with at least 50% recycled materials and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper."
This more sustainable box is now available in every P&G region globally.
"It delights consumers with its ease of opening, appearance at shelf and full recyclability."
We estimate this exterior packaging change saves the plastic equivalent of more than 85 million water bottles per year (based on 2020 sales volumes for North America and select Europe markets).
Breakthrough Innovation and Partnership Toward Circular Plastic P&G aims to incorporate more recycled plastic in our packaging to reduce our reliance on virgin plastic and ensure that existing materials are better utilized.
"However, the quality of post-recycled resin does not always meet our high material standards for quality and product protection."
Our corporate R&D teams developed a process to drastically improve the quality of recycled polypropylene (PP) plastic.
This plastic resin accounts for roughly 20% of the plastic used in our packaging and has the potential to significantly increase our use of recycled content.
"This P&G process, VersoVita, takes nearly all the imperfections out of the resin and returns it to near-virgin quality."
"Rather than keeping this capability internally, P&G is making VersoVita Circular Polymer Purification available for license to plastic manufacturers globally so they can produce high quality recycled resin to better meet industry demand and reduce plastic waste."
P&G is also a proud supporter of The Recycling Partnerships Polypropylene Recycling Coalition.
This industry collaboration recently led to the upgrading of polypropylene rigid containers as Widely Recyclable by the How2Recycle program (effective July 2022).
1 This designation is the result of enrolling the full plastics recycling value chain to work together and increase the rate of recycling on this resin which is widely used in packaging and finished goods.
Our efforts to advance the state of recycling through innovation paired with external collaborations via licensing and supporting industry-wide efforts are truly advancing the circularity and reuse of plastic resins.
