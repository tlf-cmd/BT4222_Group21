"Here at McDonalds, our purpose is to feed and foster communities."
"When we say, billions served, were not just talking about burgers."
"Were talking about serving our communities, customers, crew, farmers, franchisees and suppliers."
Because we believe theres a difference between being in a community and being part of o ne.
"City lines, county lines, even state lines."
These things dont create communities.
People do.
Were consistently inspired by the way people come together in ways big and small to support their communities.
But they cant afford to go it alone they ne ed support now more than ever.
"In response, were prioritizing our role and commitments in the tens of thousands of communities we operate in."
"Were also speaking up about our impact on the communities we have been serving for more than 65 years, and how w e plan to feed and foster the future of those communities over the next 65 years."
How can McDonalds make the biggest difference?

17 Food Safety Why It Matters Providing safe food is our number one priority and a responsibility that we take seriously.
Our customers expect McDonalds to maintain food safety standards and protocols and were working hard to ensure we always meet those expectations.
Food safety has been at the core of everything we do for decades.
"We integrate it into every aspect of our operations from food sourcing and menu developm ent to packaging, distribution and logistics, and the daily running of our restaurants."
"To mark our commitment to food safety, we celebrate World Food Safety Day in June, which was established by the United Nations to bring global attention to this priorit y topic."
Our Strategy Food safety is a collaborative effort that starts long before food products reach restaurants.
We work closely with a robust network of farmers and suppliers to ensure safe food is the number one priority for everyone in our value cha in.
"To do this, McDonalds renewed and refreshed our Global Food Safety Strategy in 2019, which ensures we integrate food safety into the design of food, packaging, equipment and restaurants, as well as operational procedures and employee training."
The str ategy is centered on three operating principles: 18 1.
The safety of our food and that of our customers is non -negotiable and top priority for McDonalds.
2.
Our food safety protocols are science -based and validated by external third parties.
3.
McDonalds fosters a culture of food safety from farm to fork.
"This means working with farmers, suppliers, distribution centers and restaurants to ensure food safety at every step along the way."
"We also developed a new Global Food Safety Structure, receiving support from McDonalds leadership to add more resources to the global team in 2020 and 2021."
"Through the new structure, we have dedicated resources in the areas of global food safety risk management and food safety standard deployment and training."
Our newly formed Food Safety Field Service Team supports our McDonalds markets to ensure they have received training and are operating in compliance with our Companys standards and expectations.
The team also facilitates best practice sharing.
"The members of this team are st rategically located in the Middle East, Europe and Latin America, enabling strong connection to the Developmental Licensee (DL) markets and helping to elevate our food safety culture globally."
"Despite starting its operations fairly recently, we are already experiencing enhanced communication between global and markets with updated food safety policies, standards and training programs."
"To make sure our policies and procedures are upheld throughout our supply chain, we focus on assessing potential risks with our suppliers as well."
"This includes supplier selection/ approval and onboarding; training and calibration with suppliers and farmers; and third -party audits for suppliers, distribution centers and restaurants to ensure compliance with our high standa rds."
Elevating Food Safety Culture We recognize the importance of having a strong food safety culture within our Company for everyone from crew members to the CEO.
"That is why we have ongoing programs to educate employees about safe food handling with our suppliers, and provide regular food safety trainings for restaurant operators and staff."
"Restaurant crew members receive training on food safety during the onboarding process, with managers undergoing a more robust learning program."
"Webinars are held to tr ain our market food safety and quality leads on the most up -to-date food safety, hygiene and sanitation standards."
"In 2020, McDonalds developed training for all corporate staff as part of our e -learning modules."
In the U.
"S., we also hold supplier calibrat ion and trainings to ensure alignment."
"As an example of this important work, in Latin America, our Franchisee Arcos Dorados launched the Be Safe Food Protection Program to reinforce Company culture and support the improvement plan for Restaurant Food Safet y Audit Results."
"Be Safe is a 19 foundational program reinforcing a culture of service to our customers and employees, and is sponsored by Arcos Dorados Chief Executive Order, Chief Operating Officer and divisional presidents."
"In light of the COVID -19 pandem ic, Arcos Dorados has evolved this program to include Safety and Wellness."
"In 2020, just over 62,000 employees in the Arcos Dorados region received food safety training."
"This is lower than the previous year, as crew and manager turnover decreased due to th e COVID -19 pandemic."
"In 2018 McDonalds used a third party's food safety culture assessment tool developed by The British Retail Consortium (BRC) Global Standards to conduct a food safety culture assessment of our en tire System on a regular basis, including representatives of restaurant owners and operators, suppliers and corporate staff globally."
The results informed the ongoing development of our Global Food Safety Strategy.
"Addressing any gaps identified during the assessment, we are now focusing on four key areas where we can elevate our food safety culture: Continue to engage our corporate leaders on food safety."
Increase visibility of food safety by having relevant food safety training and communications.
Inves t in innovative approaches to improve food safety practices.
Reward excellence in food safety.
"Collaborating With Stakeholders We work with leading food companies, academia and regulatory agencies on advancing food safety standards and practices globally."
In particular: We have a Food Safety Advisory Council (FSAC) formed of food safety professionals and leaders.
The group meets annually to listen to progress made by McDonalds and to offer guidance on areas for improvement and current industry be st practices.
Conference calls/virtual meetings occur between the annual meetings.
McDonalds participates in the Global Good Agricultural Practices (GLOBALG.
A.P.)
working groups and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to understand current and emer ging food safety risks.
We also contribute to the discussion and share best practices to benefit the food safety community at large.
"We are a member of SSAFE, a not -for-profit organization that aims to foster continuous improvement and global acceptance of internationally recognized food protection systems and standards through public -private partnerships."
What makes SSAFE unique is its focus on driving collaboration between the 20 public and private sector to enhan ce the integrity of the food supply chain.
"In 2020 -2021, McDonalds participated in a collaboration to develop a simple food safety culture assessment tool for companies to use globally."
This tool is free for all users and will benefit the entire food indu stry to elevate food safety culture.
"On behalf of the SSAFE board, we have been actively sharing learning with industry and government agencies to strengthen food safety culture."
"We hold a membership with the research organization Campden BRI and Center for Food Safety at University of Georgia, USA."
This enables us to remain up to date with the most current science and industry best practices.
We also contribute information related to food safety by sharing our own best practices through Campden BRI and Ce nter for Food Safety.
"McDonalds has a team of internal food safety professionals who keep abreast of leading science and risk management around food safety by participating in external meetings and collaborations with academia, government and industry."
"Several team members hold advanced science degrees in Food Microbiology, Food Science and Food Safety, and are members of the International Association for Food Protection, an organization with a mission to protect the global food supply."
Putting Standards Into Practice McDonalds has developed and implemented science - and risk -based food safety and quality standards through collaboration with internal and external experts.
"These standards include the McDonalds Global Good Agriculture Program (GAP), Supplie r Food Safety and Quality Management Systems and the Distribution Center Quality Management Program."
"Our raw material and food processing suppliers, as well as logistic partners, must implement and document compliance with these standards."
"Annual third -party food safety verification audits are conducted with our suppliers (including grower locations for produce and slaughter and deboning facilities for protein products), distribution centers and restaurant locations."
Performance measure indicators are pub lished and reviewed by our leadership team on a quarterly basis.
"Most McDonalds suppliers, distribution centers and restaurant locations meet or exceed our expectations."
"However, where our requirements are not met, corrective actions are implemented and v erified."
Food safety standards are also implemented at every McDonalds restaurant.
Restaurant food safety and quality management procedures are integrated into the McDonalds Operations and Training Program and based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point principles.
"Daily checks against key food safety standards and procedures are conducted in all restaurants, while implementation of these standards is verified through internal or third -party audits."
We host calibration sessions with our approved third -party auditing firms to ensure audits are as robust as possible.
"In 2019, 21 we updated our restaurant food safety auditing standards and supplier food safety and quality audit guidance."
The COVID -19 pandemic showed us that hygiene and safety are important dri vers of brand trust for our customers as well as our employees throughout the supply chain.
We have identified opportunities to develop our hygiene and safety protocols.
"We are now using our experience, these learnings and scientific expertise to further strengthen our standards and processes and integrate enhancements into our review process."
We annually review our policies and standards to identify opportunities for improvement based on current science and industry best practices.
We engage our stakeholde rs during the review process to gather their input before granting approval for any new or revised standards and policies.
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Our work to ensure food safety helps support the UN Sustainable Development Goals , a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 2: Zero Hunger 22 Our Actions Ensuring Food Safety From Source to Destination Were working closely with the produce industry, as well as relevant experts, to lead the effort on establishing best practices for on -farm activities, including those related to Water Stewardship and soil management, and on -farm food safety risk assessments."
"In sourcing protein, McDonalds has developed an Approved Supplier List."
"In order for our suppliers to be part of this preapproved list, they have to demonstrate compliance with our requirements and be able to pass audits."
"We provide online McDonalds Global GAP training, and regularly update related materials for our suppliers and farmers."
"We also host in -person training for our suppliers and farmers, as well as local government agencies, in various regions, such as in Asia, Latin America and Europe."
We engage with our global logistics partners to implement continuous temperature monitoring sy stems in the trucks that move our produce and ingredients.
This gives us complete visibility of product temperature during transportation and helps us monitor food safety and quality in real time.
"Bringing Supplier Training Online in China In order to maximize supplier engagement and participation in food safety trainings, in June 2020, we launched the first in a new e -learning series for suppliers in China."
"The McDonalds Supply Chain Immerging Course is open to all suppliers and cross - functional team s at McDonalds, and is taught over seven modules through training videos and tests."
The modules cover important information on issues ranging from global product quality and food safety standards to risk management systems and contingency plans.
"To date, over 856 suppliers, supply chain members and cross - function team members have registered for the program, with 268 already completing all seven modules."
McDonalds China has conducted annual food safety e -learning and certification with all company employ ees (including office staff) for the past seven years.
"In 2021, 170,000 employees went through the e -learning and were certified."
Digitizing Food Safety We are always looking for new opportunities to harness technology to improve efficiency.
"Since 2017, we have launched an interactive global food safety website to connect our people all over the world to learn more about hygiene and safety in a fun way, with McDonalds CEO, Owner/Operators and suppliers sharing their commitment to food safety."
"For our corpo rate employees, we have developed a food safety e - learning module to learn more about safe handling of food at home."
23 We have started a process to implement digital food safety at restaurant level.
"The initiative helps restaurants more efficiently complete daily and monthly food safety tasks, such as temperature checks for cooked meat, monitoring product temperatures in freezers and chillers, converting paper lists to digital checklists and recording important food safety information."
This Digital Food Safet y system will be implemented in all markets by the end of 2022 and will make it easier and faster for our restaurant employees and managers to follow procedures and demonstrate compliance.
"Sharing Food Safety Best Practices We believe food safety should be a key consideration for every company in our industry, not a competitive advantage."
That is why the McDonalds Global Food Safety Team continues to be actively engaged with a variety of external stakeholders to share best practices and learnings related t o the mitigation of food safety risks.
"In February 2020, at the Global Food Safety Initiative's (GFSI) Global Food Safety Conference in Seattle, USA, a team member shared best practices of the steps McDonalds takes to better target food safety trainings t o restaurant employees and how we are leveraging technology to ensure our food safety standards and procedures are communicated and implemented."
"In July 2020, a member of the Global Food Safety Team who serves on the board of stakeholders for the BRC spok e on a panel about business resilience in the food industry."
Another team member attended a virtual event at the Institute of Food Technologists in June 2020 to present findings on the presence and control of the parasite Cyclospora cayetanensis .
"He took t o the virtual stage with leading academic and regulatory experts, sharing information with food safety professionals regarding the monitoring and mitigation strategies McDonalds is implementing to mitigate the prevalence of this organism in produce."
"In th e first half of 2021, our team members have continued to participate and speak at conferences."
These include the BRC Food Safety Conference and the IAPF Asian Conference in January.
"Throughout March, they attended the GFSI Global Virtual Conference and the Center of Food Safety at University of Georgia, USA Annual Conference, engaged with EFSA emerging risk taskforce and Consumer Food Safety Education Conference and acted as co -chair for the Consumer Food Safety Education Conference, USA."
Enhancing Support for Food Safety Our newly formed Food Safety Field Service Team supports McDonalds markets to ensure they have received training and are operating in compliance with Company standards and expectations.
"The team also facilitates best practices sharing, covering needs from farm to restaurant."
The members of this team are enabling strong connection to all McDonalds DL markets and helping elevate our food safety culture globally.
"Despite starting its operations fairly recently, we are already experiencing 24 enhanced communicat ion between global and markets with updated food safety policies, standards and training programs."
"Virtually Celebrating Food Safety Week In June of 2020 and 2021, we celebrated food safety week virtually due to the COVID - 19 pandemic."
"For 2021, the them e was Food Safety Matters Everywhere with additional focus on hygiene and foreign material prevention."
Leaders from different functions and markets shared their perspectives on how food safety matters to everybody and how it is connected with McDonalds core values.
"We also engaged with suppliers and markets during the week, with successful features such as Ask the Experts which provided an opportunity for direct dialogue between market food safety leads and global food safety experts."
Recipe for Succes s Our Recipe for Success program is designed to promote and elevate food safety and quality culture and was launched in the U.
K. and Ireland in 2019.
"Through this program, our food and packaging are produced to exacting specifications and high standards of food safety and quality."
"In order to meet these standards, they need to be fully understood and practiced daily by everyone in our System, no matter what position they hold."
"Along with suppliers, McDonalds has developed best practice processes to drive c onsistency and improvement."
"Supporting Digital Connections for Food Safety During the pandemic, we hosted two global supplier virtual events, one in October 2020 and another in April 2021 to share best practices on elevating food safety culture, controlling food safety hazards and mitigating food safety risks."
Each event hosted over 650 global attendees and were well received.
We continue to host food safety training webinars for our suppliers and market food safety leads virtually in 2021.
"Betwee n January and June 20 of 2021, we hosted four webinars with over 800 attendees."
"Taking a Risk based Approach to Supplier Audits During COVID -19 During the pandemic, McDonalds Global Food Safety Strategy provided guidance to markets, suppliers and audit fi rms regarding a risk -based approach to conducting food safety audits."
The advice focused on conducting audits during times of restricted movement or lockdown situations in countries or regions where suppliers operate.
A method of risk quantification was us ed to allow for certain suppliers to be subjected to virtual audits.
"McDonalds provided audit firms with specific guidance and recommendations to ensure pre -planning and remote assessment, and reporting/ post -assessments were conducted to minimize disrupt ions in conducting audits and maintain audit quality."
"In addition, best practice sharing and learning sessions were 25 conducted where audit firms were able to exchange information on their challenges and successes."
Reporting procedures were also changed to d ifferentiate between on - site and virtual audits.

"Why It Matters As one of the most frequented restaurants in the world, we help feed millions of people every day."
"We provide families with a variety of choices to meet their needs, bringing families together to share moments and create lasting memories."
"Parents are looking for menu choices that they can feel good about feeding their kids, and thats why were focused on evolving the Happy Meal and making balanced meals 27 more accessible to families across the world."
"McD onalds will continue to take a responsible approach to our Happy Meals by offering balanced options and promoting menu items that contribute to recommended food groups, such as fruits, vegetables and low -fat dairy."
Our Strategy We are always listening to our customers and evaluating our menu to identify ways to evolve our offerings while maintaining the great taste our customers know and love.
"For example, were working with and learning from families to find areas where our system has the best opportunity to create positive and meaningful change."
We also have a team of food experts who are passionate about food and are always looking for the latest flavor and ingredient innovations.
"Since 2013, we have been working with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation (Healthier Generation) , a third -party nonprofit organization, to evolve our Happy Meal menu and use our size and scale to promote more balanced choices for kids."
"We also work with Keybridge, an independent third party, to measure and publicly report our progress in the 20 major markets toward our commitments."
"These organizations help us define our targets and measure progress, and we continue to prioritize future action and continuo us improvement."
"McDonalds commitment to working with Healthier Generation to help increase access to fruits, vegetables, low -fat dairy and water options demonstrates a willingness to collaborate and leverage their global size and influence for public goo d."
"Kathy Higgins, CEO, Alliance for a Healthier Generation In 2018, we announced five new, ambitious Global Happy Meal Goals to be achieved by the end of 2022."
"28 We developed these new goals in collaboration with Healthier Generation, focusing on kids and families, as thats where we believe we can have the biggest impact."
"When developing these goals, we sought input from third -party nutrition experts and used rigorous criteria grounded in science and nutrition policy to ensure the goals were relevant and r eflect the evolving needs of our customers."
"The Global Happy Meal Goals continue our focus on Happy Meals, offering more wholesome choices that kids and parents love."
"We aim to deliver balanced meals that provide a variety of options from recommended food groups, using simpler, quality ingredients so parents can feel good about our Happy Meal menu."
"We aim to achieve these goals in all markets globally2 by the end of 2022, with measurement and progress reporting among 20 major markets representing nearly 85% of McDonalds Systems global Happy Meal sales."
Marketing Responsibly Were proud of our long history as an industry leader in responsible marketing to children.
We recognize the role we play as a global food company and are actively involved in self -regulation focused on this important issue.
"As a global brand reaching millions of children an d families every day, we understand the importance of responsibly communicating with children."
This is an area that must be addressed at both a company and an industry level.
"Thats why we participate in a number of local and regional pledges, such as the EU Pledge and the U."
S. Childrens Food & Beverage Advertising Initiative .
"Our global policies are guided by these pledges as well as our own Glob al Marketing to Children Guidelines, which apply to all of our markets around the world."
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Our nutrition and marketing practices help support the UN Sustainable Development Goals a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 2: Zero Hunger (Specifically targets 2.1) Our Performance 29 We established goals around nutrition to ensure we are offering increased access to options that support balanced diets."
"At the same time, our marketing goals help us drive progress in supporting customers to make informed choices."
The Global Happy Meal Goals apply to all markets globally with measurement and reporting of progress among o ur 20 major markets: U.
"S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, U."
"K., France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Russia, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan and Australia."
"For more detail on our progress, including scope, exclusion s and methodology, please view our Global Happy Meal Goals 2020 Interim Progress Re port (PDF 28.2 MB) ."
"We used the latest data available for each goal in this progress report, while maintaining the rigor of verification from Keybridge, our third -party validator that monitors and evaluates our commitments."
"Goal 1: Offer Balanced Meals By the end of 2022, ensure 50% or more of the Happy Meal Bundle Offerings listed on menus in each market meet McDonalds Global Happy Meal Nutrition Criteria of less than or equal to: 600 calories, 10% of calories from saturated fat, 650 mg of sodium and 10 % of calories from added sugar."
"Progress 8 of the 20 major markets met the 2022 goal in 2019, up from 3 markets in 2018."
An average of 43% of Happy Meal Bundles met the Nutrition Criteria across the 20 major markets in 2019.
"Goal 2: Simplify Ingredients By the end of 2022, remove artificial flavors and added colors from artificial sources in Happy Meals and reduce artificial preservatives where feasible in Happy Meals without sacrificing the safety, taste, quality or value of our food."
Progress 12 of the 20 major markets met the 2022 goal in early 2020.
"Goal 3: Be Transparent With Happy Meal Nutrition Information By the end of 2022, ensure that nutrition information for Happy Meals is available and accessible through all owned websites and mobile apps used for ordering where they exist."
"Progress 30 12 of the 20 major markets met the 2022 goal in Q2 2020, up from 6 markets in Q1 2019."
"Goal 4: Market Responsibly By the end of 2022, all Happy Meal bundles advertised to children will meet McDonalds Global Happy M eal Nutrition Criteria and continue to meet any existing applicable local/regional advertising pledges."
Progress 16 of the 20 major markets met the 2022 goal in 2019.
"Additionally, 100% of ads shown to children in 2019 featured water, milk or juice as the Happy Meal beverage and fruits, vegetables or dairy as a Happy Meal side."
"Goal 5: Leverage Innovative Marketing By the end of 2022, leverage innovative marketing to help increase purchase of foods and beverages that contain recommended food groups in Happy Meals."
Progress 16 of the 20 major markets sold an increased share of Happy Meal items containing recommended food groups in 2019 versus 2018.
"Our Actions Making Progress Toward Our Global Happy Meal Goals These latest goals build on work we launched in 2013, in partnership with Healthier Generation, to develop a comprehensive plan to help increase customers access to fruits, vegetables, low -fat dairy and water by 2020 across 20 major markets."
"The commitmen ts, which a majority of markets achieved in 2019, encompassed five that relate to improvements in menu offerings, menu boards, packaging and advertising directed at children."
"In October 2020, we released a global progress report, demonstrating the meaningful progress weve made towards the five Global Happy Meal Goals ."
"Across our 20 major markets, half of all beverages sold in Happy Meals were water, milk or juice in 2019, and over 2.5 billion Happ y Meal items sold since 2018 contained fruits, vegetables, low -fat dairy, water, lean protein or whole grains."
"Additionally, as of early 2020, 93% of Happy Meal menu items have no artificial flavors, added colors from artificial sources, or artificial pres ervatives that could be feasibly reduced."
"To learn more about our progress, download the Global Happy Meal Goals 2020 Interim Progress Report (PDF 28.2 MB) ."
"31 We have served over 8 billion fruit, vegetable, low -fat dairy and water items in our Happy Meals since September 2013 across our 20 major markets."
We know theres more work to be done as we continue toward 2022.
"This progress marks an important step in providing access to more wholesome, balanced options made with high -quality ingredients."
"Achieving the Commitments We Made in 2013 In 2019, we announced that the majority of McDonald s 20 major markets met the commitments we set in 2013 two years ahead of schedule."
"Across these markets, the percentage of Happy Meal customers choosing milk, water or juice as their beverage increased by 12 percentage points between 2013 and 2018."
Evolving the Menu in the U.
S. We are always looking for ways to innovate and evolve our menu options.
"Staring in May 2018, the beef served in Quarter Pounder burgers in the U."
"S. is sourced only from North America,3|4 and cooked fresh in restaurants across the country."
"On September 26, 2018, we announced that all of our classic burgers have no artificial preservatives, no artificial flavors and no added colors from artificial sources."
"Our pickle contains an artificial preservative, so skip it if you like.5 In early 2020, we introdu ced a new reduced sugar, low -fat chocolate milk that contains 25% less sugar than leading quick service restaurants low -fat chocolate milk6."
Its a great example of how we partner with the dairy industry and our supply chain to create a menu innovation and offer more balanced options for our younger guests.
Nutrition Improvements in the U.
K. We wan t to make it easier for our customers to make healthier choices.
Our nutrition strategy in the U.
K. has been in place for over 15 years.
"During this time, we have reformulated over 200 of our ingredients and invested heavily in broadening our menu of balan ced healthy options."
"We have introduced more salad options, as well as fruit and vegetable bags, orange juice, mineral water and organic semi -skimmed milk."
"To date, 90% of our core food and drink menu is under 500 calories."
We review and update our Happy M eal menu regularly.
"In 2020, we launched our Veggie Dippers, approved by the Vegetarian Society."
"Around 70% of items in our Happy Meal menu are non -high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) according to the UK Nutrient Profile Model."
"As part of our broader efforts, we are leveraging technology to encourage customers to choose balanced options."
Showing the lower calorie soft drinks first on our menu ordering screens has encouraged more customers to buy them with over 1.9 million 32 purchases switched from high er sugar variants to the no added sugar options7 when this was first introduced in 2017.
Foot notes 1 U.
"S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, U."
"K. France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Russia, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan and Australia."
2 It is important to note that our global System consists of both Company -owned and franchised restaurants.
"The franchised restaurants are operated by conventional Franchisees, developmental licensees (i.e., a Franchisee that operates most or all of the McDonalds -branded restaurants in a specific market) or pursuant to other licensing arrangements, and make up the majority of McDonalds -branded restaurants around the world."
"Our Franchisees make independent decisions for their own business organizations, subject to their obligations under the operative franchise or other license agreements and core standards required for the McDonalds brand."
"McDonalds does not prescribe all business requirements for our Franchisees, but rather we work in collaboration with them to raise awareness and provide tools and opportunities to assist th em as part of the brands food journey."
We also work with Franchisees to mutually set objectives and targets and to help monitor their related progress.
"As a result, while we will encourage Franchisees to participate in the important goals outlined in this document, we cannot guarantee their compliance."
"However, we can drive change in our Company -owned restaurants, so much of this work will start with Company -owned restaurants, with a plan to demonstrate success and expand measurement, and that will ultimat ely help to support independent Franchisees that choose to join us on this journey."

33 Responsible Sourcing Progress Highlights We are incredibly proud that we have substantially achieved1 every one of our 2020 responsible sourcing goals related to sustainably sourcing our priority commodi ties.
"These are some of the worlds most in -demand ingredients, requiring intensive agriculture to feed the world."
It's imperative that they are produced with sustainability as the priority.
"Despite the complexity of our global supply chains that is just w hat McDonalds has done and with the scale of our operations, this means our work is already helping to have a positive impact around the world."
"Below are just some of the highlights from this work: Substantially achieved1 responsible sourcing goals for our six priority products: beef, chicken (soy for feed), coffee, palm oil, fish and fiber -based guest packagin g 100% of our soy sourced for chicken feed globally supports the responsible production of soy 98.7% of fish sourced for McDonalds Filet -o-Fish came from verified sustainable sources in 2020 99.6% of our primary fiber -based guest packaging was sourced from recycled or certified sources in 2020 and supported deforestation -free supply chains 34 Please see our performance section and footnotes below for additional detail on goals and thresholds for achievemen t."
"Why It Matters Our customers expectations continue to evolve, and were evolving with them, putting even more focus on our food where it comes from, what goes into it and how its prepared."
McDonalds partners with a global network of suppliers and farmers to provide quality ingredients and packaging materials.
"By engaging our supply chain, we have greater visibility and can support more sustainable production, so we can continue to serve our customers the delicious meals they know and love."
"Our Strategy We approach responsible sourcing holistically, considering our impact on the planet, the livelihoods of the people who produce our food, the communities in which they live and the well -being of the animals we rely on."
"We want to ensure that our sustainable sourcing programs drive lasting, meaningful outcomes on critical issues for people, animals, the environment and our business."
This vision inspires our focus on the following priority impact areas: Promoting the health and welfare of animals Respecting human rights Addressing climate change Reducing food and packaging waste Protecting water resources Conserving forests Farmer livelihoods We set standards for our sourcing and engage closely with our supply chain to ensure they are upheld.
"To maintain a transparent, responsible supply chain, we require all our suppliers to comply with the McDonalds Supplier Code of Conduct (PDF 1.4 MB) , which sets out our values and expectations for human rights, the workplace environm ent and business integrity."
"35 Our Focus Areas Currently, we focus on six priority products: beef, chicken, coffee, palm oil, fish and fiber -based packaging."
These products were identified through independent analysis by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as thos e that carry the greatest sustainability impacts and where we have the most potential to create positive change.
We have set ambitious goals to guide our responsible sourcing efforts.
Learn more about the progress we're making in the Our Performance section below.
"Beef Were one of the worlds biggest buyers of beef, so we are serious abou t our responsibility to help identify and scale the most sustainable practices."
"In 2014, we released our global commitment to beef sustainability, outlining our strategy to work with beef producers and partners across the value chain to support the broader adoption of sustainability practices within and beyond our supply chain."
"Our strategy focuses on strengthening farming communities, conserving forests, reducing emissions related to beef production, enhancing soil carbon sequestration, promoting the respo nsible use of antibiotics, and protecting the health and welfare of animals."
"Chicken (soy for feed) We take a holistic and data -driven approach to sourcing our chicken, with a focus on promoting responsible antibiotic use, improving animal health and welfare, and identifying innovative solutions for feed."
"In 2018, we brought together an independent global Chicken Sustainability Advisory Council, comprising experts in genetics, leading academics and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to define what sustainably sourced chicken means and to determine what ac tions should be prioritized."
Weve been on a journey to enhance our chicken sourcing requirements from launching our 8 Bold Moves for Broiler Welfare to supporting sustainable soy production designed to take pressure off tropical forests in the longer te rm.
We know theres more to do and were committed to improving the resiliency and the sustainability of our chicken supply chain.
"Coffee Our ambition is that our customers can walk into a McDonalds restaurant anywhere in the world and enjoy an affordabl e, high -quality cup of coffee that is sustainably sourced and supports farming communities."
"36 We believe that, by sustainably sourcing coffee, we support the growth of a market that rewards farmers for adopting sound environmental and social practices."
"Most of our coffee is certified to international sustainability standards through world -leading certification schemes such as Rainforest Alliance, UTZ, Fairtrade International and Fair Trade USA."
"We also source from suppliers that are approved by the McCafe Sus tainability Improvement Platform (McCafe SIP) program, established by McDonalds in partnership with Conservation International and our coffee roasters."
The McCafe SIP framework is our long -term investment for a more sustainable future.
"Its how we engage and guide our coffee supply chain in sustainable sourcing, as well as invest in coffee growers and their communities over the long term."
"Through the framework, McDonalds roasters leverage their expertise to in novate and advance sustainable farming practices in partnership with farmers."
"McCafe SIP is currently active in five countries across South and Central America, reaching nearly 6,000 farms as of 20192."
Palm Oil All palm oil sourced for McDonalds restaurants and used as an ingredient3 in McDonalds products supports sustainable production and deforestation -free supply chains through Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) .
But theres still more to do.
Palm oil is the basis of livelihoods for millions of farmers and communities.
It requires less land than other major oil -produ cing crops due to its substantially higher oil yield .
"However, with demand growing, natural forests have been replaced by palm oil plantations, leading to reduced biodiversity, increased carbon dioxide emissions and even the displacement of communities."
We believe that palm oil can and must be sustainable and we will continue to explore high -impact partnerships at local and international levels.
"It has been a key focus for our responsible sourcing work since 2011 when we joined the RSPO , and we remain committed to reporting on an annual basis to the RSPO Annual Communication on Progress.3 Fish Thriving marine ecosystems are essential for biodiversity, livelihoods, food security and economies."
"We also depend on them for Fil et-o-Fish, one of our much loved menu items."
"Healthy aquatic ecosystems sustain fish supplies and, as such, are very important to the communities that depend upon them, and to McDonalds."
"That is why weve worked with partners and independent experts for many years, such as the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP), Conservation International and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), to continue identifying ways to improve the health of marine ecosystems."
"37 Over the years, McDonalds has played an important role in improving the sustainability of the global whitefish sector via the implementation of independently verified criteria around healthy fish stocks, impact of fishing on ecosystems, fisheries management and other key actions."
"We support global efforts to restore depleted fish stocks, improve fishery management and conserve marine environments."
We ask our suppliers to source all the wild -caught fish for McDonalds Filet -o-Fish from verified sustainable sources.
"Additionally, most of the f isheries from which we source are MSC certified."
McDonalds displays the MSC certification logo for our Filet -o-Fish in the U.
"S., Canada, Brazil and many of our European markets, where fisheries and restaurants are certified against the MSC Chain of Custod y traceability standard.4 Fiber Fiber is the main material in our product packaging."
"If we are to conserve forests and accelerate climate action, we must also ensure we source fiber from recycled or certified sources and support deforestation -free supply chains."
We set a goal to source all primary fiber -based guest packaging for McDonalds restaurants from re cycled or certified sources and support deforestation -free supply chains by the end of 2020.
"This ambition helps to ensure that in switching to more sustainable packaging materials, were also actively assessing deforestation risk and taking action to cons erve forests."
"This target supports our larger goal that by 2025, all of McDonalds guest packaging will come from renewable, recycled or certified sources5."
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Our responsible sourcing achievements help support the UN Sustainable Development Goals , a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production (Specifically target 12.2) 38 Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically target 17.16) Our Performance Sustainable Sourcing Goals Goal: Fish By the end of 2020, all of the wild -caught fish sourced for use in McDonalds products to come from verified sustainable sources4."
Progress McDonalds is one of the largest purchasers of white fish in the world.
"More than 265 million su stainably sourced, wild -caught Filet -o-Fish sandwiches were served in 2020 and 98.7% of the fish sourced for McDonalds Filet -o-Fish came from sustainably managed wild -caught fisheries, assessed and verified annually against the McDonalds Sustainable Fish eries Standard by the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership."
Our Filet -o-Fish sandwiches represent more than 98% of the fish we used by weight in 2020.
"Goal: Beef - Accelerate Industry Progress By the end of 2020, source a portion of our beef from suppliers pa rticipating in sustainability programs aligned with the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) principles and criteria and that meet McDonalds requirements in our top 10 beef sourcing countries globally.6 Progress We sourced beef from sustainability programs aligned with the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) principles and criteria and that meet McDonalds requirements in 10 out of 10 of our top 10 beef sourcing countries by the end of 2020."
Read about these initiatives on our Sustainable Agriculture & Beef page.
"Goal: Palm Oil 39 By the end of 2020, all the palm oil sourced for McDonalds resta urants and used as an ingredientin McDonalds products will support the production of sustainable palm oil and deforestation -free supply chains.3 Progress 100% of the palm oil used in McDonalds restaurants and as an ingredient in McDonalds products supported the production of sustainable palm oil and deforestation -free supply chains in 2020."
"We estimate this is equal to over 60,000 acres of palm oil production meeting our criteria in 2020, an area larger than 485,000 McDonalds restaurants side -by-side, which is 12 times the number of actual McDonalds restaurants globally."
We are committed to in creasing traceability for palm oil used in the McDonalds System.
Our palm oil supply has been RSPO -certified since 2017 through either physical certification or credits.
"In 2020, 78% of our palm oil globally was physically certified (RSPO Indentity Preser ved, Segregated and Mass Balance), increasing from 71% in 2019."
"Additionally, 93% of products using the largest amounts of palm oil in the McDonalds System (restaurant and parfry oils) were RSPO physically certified."
"By RSPO Supply Chain Model: 78% Physical RSPO Certified 71% Mass Balance 7% Segregated 0.1% Identity Preserved 22% Book and Claim Credits Goal : Chicken (including soy for feed) By the end of 2020, all soy sourced for the feed of chicken used in McDonalds products will support deforestation -free supply chains7."
Progress 100% of soy sourced for the feed of chicken used in McDonalds p roducts supports deforestation -free supply chains globally.
We support responsible soy production through the purchase of RTRS credits.
A number of our chicken suppliers to Europe also use physical certification through Proterra standards.
"In 2020, in rela tion to the soy for the feed of chicken used in McDonalds products in Europe, McDonalds assessed that 17% of the volume was linked to physical certification and 83% of the volume was matched through the purchase of book and claim credits."
"40 We estimate that the volume of sustainably farmed soy McDonalds used in 2020 adds up to more than 359,000 acres of farms or enough to cover the Island of Manhattan 24 times over meeting this production standard."
"Goal : Coffee By the end of 2020, all coffe e sourced for McDonalds restaurants will be sustainably sourced2."
Progress 98.1% of our ground and whole be an coffee was sustainably sourced in 2020.
Our volume of sustainably sourced coffee is enough to brew close to five billion small cups of McCafe coffee.
"Goal : Fiber By the end of 2020, all primary fiber -based guest packaging sourced for McDonalds restaura nts will come from recycled or certified sources5."
Progress McDonalds is one of the top sustainable fiber users in the world.
"In 2020, 99.6% of our primary fiber -based guest packaging was sourced from recycled or certified sources."
Animal Health and Welfare Goals Goal: Animal Housing Progress In the U.
"S., were working with pork suppliers to phase out the use of gestation stalls (small, enclosed pens) for housing pregnant sows by 2022."
We achieved our 2017 milestone to source pork for our U.
S. business only from producers who share our commitment to phase out gestation stalls.
The U.
S. pork supply chain is currently tracking at around 50% of our 2022 target.
"Although progress and conversion rates have been delayed by the impacts of COVID -19 and the global outbreak of African Swine Fever, we remain committed to working with our suppliers and agricultural partners to achieve our commitment ."
Goal: Cage -Free and Free -Range Eggs Progress 41 The U.
S. egg supply chain is 62% cage -free.

Pilots established in each of our top 10 beef sourcing countries to reduce the overall use of medically important antibiotics Why It Matters Antimicrobial resistance is a critical global public health issue.
"McDonalds understands the key role we play in creating awareness throughout our supply chains on responsible antibiotic use, ensuring antibiotic effectiveness for future generations."
"Acco rding to the World Health Organization (WHO), ""overuse and misuse of antibiotics in animals and humans is contributing to the rising threat of antibiotic resistance in humans."
"""1 McDonalds is partnering with suppliers, veterinarians, academia and farmers to ensure the responsible use of antibiotics in our supply chain, including reducing the use of medical ly important antibiotics in food animal production."
Our approach is one of responsible use.
"We know that animals, like people, get sick and when they do, effective treatment includes use of the narrowest spectrum of antibiotics, based on the professional o pinion and diagnosis of the veterinarian."
"47 Through our commitment to responsible antibiotic use, we are doing our part to help preserve its effectiveness for future generations."
"Our Strategy McDonalds is committed to the responsible use of antibiotics acco rding to guidelines set out by the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (formerly the OIE) and other recognized public and animal health bodies."
Our efforts to address antimicrobial resistance within our supply chain is highlighted in our revised 2017 Vision for Antibiotic Stewardship (VAS) .
"This document outlines ou r approach to responsible antibiotic use and commitment to the development of species -specific (Chicken, Beef and Pork) policies."
"Our VAS seeks animal production practices that reduce and, where possible, eliminate the need for antibiotic therapies in ani mals, by helping to identify and scale leading practices that progressive farms already employ."
"Our VAS and protein -specific policies are based on the One Health approach, which emphasizes the need for collaborative, multi -discipline efforts at local, na tional and global levels to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment."
"We understand that animals, like people, get sick and require treatment."
Treatment of sick animals supports our decades -long commitment to improving the health and welfare of animals in our supply chain.
"As such, we support a responsible use approach, which focuses on refining antibiotics selection and administration, reducing their use and ultimately replacing antibiotics with long -term solutions to prevent diseases and protect animal health and welfare."
We remain committed to the treatment of sick animals aligned with herd veterinarian direction to ensure the safety of the consumer food supply chain.
Collaborating With Stakeholders Partnering with external experts i s at the core of how we approach the development and implementation of our antibiotics policies.
"The issue of antimicrobial resistance is one that requires global multi -stakeholder, cross -industry collaboration to tackle."
"We engage a variety of stakeholder s, including academia, suppliers, farmers and ranchers, NGOs, veterinary networks and others who have deep understanding of these issues and of ways that progress can be made."
McDonalds was a founding participant of the International Consortium for Antimicrobial Stewardship in Agriculture (ICASA).
"Through this cross -industry collaboration, we work to identify and advance commercial solutions to address antimicrobial resistance."
The path for creating and imp lementing a global antibiotic use policy for beef is unprecedented.
Ive been encouraged by the thoroughness with which McDonalds has 48 engaged diverse experts while creating this policy and the seriousness with which they take this important issue.
"Dan Thomson, MS, PhD, DVM, Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University Putting Standards Into Practice The Responsible Use of Antibiotics in Food Animals is the foundation of McDonalds global VAS."
"The following principles draw from existing framework s: People first Antibiotics that are approved for both human and animal use, other than those defined by the WHO as HPCIA, may be used in animals for disease treatment or prevention only in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and after th orough consideration of alternatives, including the use of antibiotics belonging to classes not used in human medicine."
Quality and safety McDonalds is committed to ensuring wholesome and safe food for our customers.
Safe food is McDonalds number one priority and is central to all Company operations.
Animal health and welfare Treating animals with care is integral to McDonalds animal health and welfare program.
"Disease prevention strategies, such as good husbandry and hygiene, routine health monito ring, immunization and other preventative options, should be emphasized before the use of antibiotics."
"However, to not treat sick animals is inhumane and inconsistent with McDonalds belief that food animals within the McDonalds System supply chain are pr operly cared for throughout their lives."
Antibiotics for food animals Responsible use of any category of antibiotic is an integral part of an overall animal health and welfare program.
"These principles do not preclude the responsible use of any category of antibiotic, except for HPCIAs, to treat or, where appropriate, prevent disease."
Veterinary oversight Veterinary oversight through a valid veterinary client - patient relationship is core to responsible antibiotic use.
"Antibiotics shall be used in acco rdance with all applicable regulatory requirements, and shall be used only in accordance with the product license requirements and as directed by a veterinarian."
Limit exposure Antibiotic use should be confined to appropriate clinical indications.
Expos ure to antibiotics for disease treatment or prevention should be minimized by limiting treatment to sick animals or animals at risk of a specific disease.
The use of any category of antibiotic for disease prevention should be regularly reassessed by a vete rinarian.
"Usage of an antibiotic in a manner that is not in accordance with labeled directions, including but not limited to, a different dosage, time interval, route/application method, clinical indication or species, 49 may be prescribed only after other an tibiotic treatment options have been exhausted, and must be prescribed in accordance with the most up -to-date laws and regulations that govern drug use."
Record keeping Accurate records of treatment and outcomes should be used to evaluate antibiotic reg imen.
"Identify, track and maintain medication and treatment records for all treated animals."
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Our work on responsible antibiotic use supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals , a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 2: Zero Hunger (Specifically target 2.4) Goal 12: Responsible Consumption (Specifically target 12.2) Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically target 17.16) Our Performance Goal Eliminate the use of antibiotics defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Highest Priority Critically Important Antibiotics (HPCIA) to human medicine as defined by the WHO from all chicken served by 2027.2 Progress HPCIA use has been eliminated in the following McDonalds markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan, South Korea and the United States."
China will comply on or before 2027.
"50 Goal In collaboration with our suppliers, producers and farmer partners, we will reduce the overall use of medically important antibiotics as defined by the WHO in our beef supply chain.3 Progress Beef Antibiotic Monitoring Pilots have been conducted in Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, U."
"K., Canada, U."
"S., and Brazil, representing our top 10 beef sourcing markets which supplied over 82% of our global beef supply chain as of the end of 2020."
"Starting in 2022, we will collaborate with industry leaders, academics, suppliers and experts to refine our measurement capabilities and plans to help shape a path forward."
"Following this engagement, the results from our pilots will be used to inform targets for responsible antibiotic use in our beef suppl y chain."
"Our Actions Implementing a Global Chicken Antibiotics Policy As part of our commitment to use responsibly sourced chicken, in 2017 we implemented our Chicken Antibiotics Policy in our 10 markets around the world.3 This policy requires responsible use of antibiotics in broiler chickens by System Suppliers and proh ibits antibiotics used for routine prevention or growth promotion."
All in -scope markets are on track to eliminate the use of HPCIAs in our chicken supply on or before 2027.
We are focused on expanding our efforts globally year -over -year.
"Since February 201 9, weve tracked antibiotic use in over 4.25 billion birds from 20 suppliers, and 85 slaughter facilities for 88 separate medicines, resulting in significant reductions in antibiotic use across our supply chain."
"We partner with Farm Animal Initiative (FAI) , a farm animal and agricultural research company based in Oxford, UK, on data collection and third -party verification of producer data."
Advocating for Responsible Antibiotic Use in Beef We implemented our Antibiotic Use Policy for Beef and Dairy Beef (PDF 520 KB) in 2018.
"Our beef policy is informed by the VAS, and follows global guidance from expert bodies like the WHO and Organization for Animal Health."
"While our policy maintains focus on the overall reduction of medically important antibiotics as defined by the WHO, aligned with the One Health approach and the 3 Rs (Reduce, Refine an d Replace) where appropriate and measurable, due to COVID related delays and knowledge gained along the way, we are evolving our plan with approaching targets."
"51 As a first step in our policy, we completed global pilot tests, partnering with producers andsuppliers, to inform market -specific baseline antibiotic use from commercial feedlots, small farm operations and dairies."
"Our efforts focused on Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Poland, the U."
K. and the U.
"S. markets, which represented our top 10 beef sourcing markets and accounted for over 82% of our global beef supply chain in 2020."
The data from these pilots will be used to inform market -appropriate targets for responsible antibiotic use in collaboration with input f rom multi -stakeholder perspectives.
"Starting in 2022, we will collaborate with industry leaders, academics, suppliers and other expert stakeholders to refine the targets and measurement capabilities that will shape our path forward for responsible antibiot ic use."
"Following this engagement, we will report insights from our pilot test baselines across our major beef sourcing markets."
"Our Pork Policy In 2021, we created a global, cross -functional working group to help develop an antibiotic policy for pork in our supply chain, anchored to responsible use."
"This draft policy has been introduced to our global suppliers, who were asked to conduct gap assessments between the requirements in our policy and their current internal policies on antibiotic use."
Th ese gap assessments will be evaluated during the first half of 2022 and used to inform the implementation timeline for the policy.

"S. pork supply chain has phased out the use of gestation stalls for housing pregnant sows Why It Matters More than ever, our customers want to know how their food is produced and where it comes from."
"McDonalds is using our size and global reach to improve animal health and welfare in the McDonald's supply chain and ensure we source chicken, eggs, beef and po rk from producers who share our commitments."
"We care about the health and welfare of the animals in our supply chain and we know that our ability to serve safe, quality food comes from animals that are cared for properly."
"To achieve this, we are partnering with suppliers and producers across our supply chain to drive toward continuous improvement throughout their lives."
"Our Strategy 54 To achieve positive impact in the health and welfare of the animals in our supply chain, we focus on: Creating objective measurement systems that are third -party verified to measure performance against industry benchmarked standards."
Taking a whole -system approach that considers everything from housing and husbandry to humane slaughter.
Working with recognized subject matter experts and academia to access guidance and to challenge the way we think.
Leveraging our global scale in our local m arkets to drive the right outcomes.
"While our standards for animal welfare are global, they incorporate the geographic variations in the way animals are raised within a global supply chain."
"In this regard, we have come to realize that a focus on a desired outcome is the best approach, allowing the local producer to achieve that outcome based on their management system."
"Norm Stocker, Vice President of Eggs & Chicken at Cargill, says, As McDonalds USAs egg supplier, the commitment they made to source 100% cage -free eggs represented a shift not only for our business with them, but for the industry, given their position as a leader."
Consumer preferences are changing and people are increasingly interested in how their food is sourced.
"McDonalds has led the wa y, with a thoughtful and measured approach to switching to cage -free eggs to meet consumer demand at a massive size and scale."
"McDonalds has led the way, with a thoughtful and measured approach to switching to cage -free eggs to meet consumer demand at a massive size and scale."
"Norm Stocker, Vice President of Eggs & Chicken, Cargill Collaborating With Stakeholders We believe that animal health and welfare is a pre -competitive opportunity and encourage industry and cross -sector collaboration."
We rely on strategic and personal relationships with experts who provide guidance on our policies and implementation strategies in each of our local markets.
"This is why, in 2018, McDonalds formed the Chicken Sustainability Advisory Council (CSAC)."
"The group includ es genetics experts, farm management consultants such as FAI Farms, leading academics and researchers, such as Dr. Temple Grandin and Dr. Harry Blokhuis, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including the World Wildlife Fund."
"Drawing on the expertise of CSAC members, we are implementing and evolving our chicken welfare and sustainability strategies."
"In 2019, a global cross -functional team helped to define 15 globally aligned farm - and processing -level key welfare indicators (KWIs) for chicken."
Measurement against 55 these indicators started in January 2021.
The KWIs are objective measurements aligned wit h recognized national and international standards such as the World Organization for Animal Health and the National Chicken Council.
McDonalds is also a founding member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GR SB) and many of the regional and national chapters around the world.
"We strongly support the five core principles of the GRSB, among them animal health and welfare."
"In 2021, using an extensive goal -setting initiative , the GRSB launched its first Global Goal for Animal Health and Welfare."
"McDonalds supports GRSBs efforts to promote goals that reflect global opportunities for industry advancement and improvement, and we are proud to serve in le adership roles and in key working groups within the GRSB."

Goal: Chicken Welfare Progress 57 Our commitments to sourcing chickens raised with improved welfare outcomes impact more than 70% of our global chicken supply and will be fully implemented on or before 2024.
58 Our Actions Ensuring Humane Slaughter McDonalds has stringent requirements regarding the humane slaughter of animals in approved slaughterhouses in our global supply chain.
These expectations are defined through species -specific standards and criteria verified by independent audits.
"Slaughterhouses on our approved supplier list (ASL) for beef, chicken and pork are independently audited annually to ensure compliance."
Stunning animals to assure insensibility prior to slaughter is a critical animal welfare requirement for McDonalds.
Fa ilure to meet our stun efficacy requirements results in immediate removal from our ASL.
"Regardless of stun method, any sensible animal observed on the bleed rail constitutes an automatic audit failure."
"As a global company, we comply with religious slaught er requirements, including Halal and Kosher, when required by our customers."
"With the exception of a limited number of markets that do not allow stunning prior to slaughter for religious reasons, all animals within our supply chain are stunned before slaug hter."
"For animals subject to religious slaughter, McDonalds religious Animal Health and Welfare standards are strictly observed."
"For more than two decades, we have worked with the industry and respected experts to better understand and improve performance on animal welfare issues at slaughter."
"We remain steadfast in our commitment to improving the health and welfare of animals in our supply chain throughout their lives, and we continue to monitor progress and identify opportunities to improve."
"Ensuring Supply Chain Compliance Our animal health and welfare requirements for all suppliers are defined in our Global Raw Material Sponsorship Program and further outlined in our Global Sustainable Sourcing Guide, as well as being embedded in our product Quality System Specifications."
"Our global and market Quality Systems teams are in frequent contact with our suppliers, reviewing their performance to ensure policies are properly implemented and consistently met."
We expect 100% of the abattoirs on our ASL to adhere to our standards for humane slaughter.
"Where suppliers are identified through independent audits as not complying, we work with them to develop their practices and, where necessary, implement robust and sustainable corrective action plans."
We ha ve aligned with the National Dairy FARM ( Farmers Assuring Responsible Management ) Program in the U.
"S. As of 2018, all U."
S. dairy suppliers have tracked the percentage of farms in their supply chain that hav e completed the FARM second - party assessment.
"In 2021, McDonalds USA achieved its 2020 commitment for all U."

"K. and the Netherlands, we only use Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) Assured pork, which means that all pig farmers are required to provide bedded pens for pigs and environments with plenty of space for them to move around."
"How Were Sourcing Chicken Responsibly In 2017, McDonalds announced a global commitment to source chickens raised with improved welfare outcomes."
"To achieve this, we have outlined eight bold moves for sustainable chicken: 1."
"Measuring key farm -level welfare outcomes We do this an ongoing basis, setting targets and reporting on progress across our largest markets ."
2.
"Developing state -of-the art welfare measurement technology Through our Sensors, Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technologies (SMART) Broiler partnership with the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR ), McDonalds seeded $4.6 million ($2 million in investment with an additional $2.6 million enabled in matching grants) to develop systems to automatically gather on farm key health and welfare indicators, including behavioral measures."
These technologies will be among the first of their kind available on a commercial scale and will help M cDonalds identify opportunities for improvement in broiler welfare.
3.
"Providing enrichments to support natural behavior We are working with supply chain partners to ensure housing environments promote natural behaviors such as pecking, perching and dust -bathing."
4.
"Running commercial trials to study the effects of certain production parameters on welfare outcomes We are conducting large -scale commercial trials in partnership with key global chicken suppliers to study the impacts that certain production pa rameters have on key welfare, environmental and farm -level outcomes."

"S.; currently, 100% of our Canadian supply chain and approximately 40% of our U."
"S. 60 supply chain utilizes CAS, while it is widely practiced by McDonalds suppliers in Europe and Australia."
We are on track to achieve 100% CAS in our U.
S. supply chain by 2024.

"Establish McDonalds Chicken Sustainability Advisory Council, which has now been in operation since 2018 and is supporting our continued journey by providing crucial insights and knowledge."
8.
Complete an assessment to measure the feasibility of extending these commitments to additional global markets where McDonalds operates.
These commitments will positively impact more than 70% of our global chicken supply and will be fully implemented by 2024.1 The chickens used for meat in our global supply chain are only reared in cage -free systems.
"We do not accept any chickens raised in caged housing, including stacked or patio systems."
"I think it's one of the most comprehensive corporate programs I have seen for chickens because it includes welfare, environmental enrichment, and sustainability."
"Dr. Temple Grandin, animal welfare expert and livestock researcher who pioneered humane slaughterhouse practices Industry Partnership on Beef Sourcing One of the ways we actively contribute to bringing the GRSB principles to life is through the European Roundtable fo r Beef Sustainability (ERBS)."
"In 2018, McDonalds chaired the ERBS as it set out its ambitious long -term commitments to beef sustainability, including several related to animal welfare: Target mortality rates are below 1.5%.2 All animals have access to loose housing (when housed) by 2030."
"All animals are given pain relief (an algesics) for all surgical procedures and for all forms of castration, dehorning and disbudding."
McDonalds is working with our suppliers and industry groups to implement these targets across our largest European sourcing countries.
"The target for loose ho using will have a particular positive impact in Poland and Germany, where tethered systems are commonplace for dairy cattle during the winter months and where changes to this practice require high levels of investment at the farm level."
"Sourcing Pork Respo nsibly 61 As of early 2022, over 60% of McDonalds U."
"S. pork supply chain has phased out the use of gestation stalls for pregnant sows, a significant step on our journey to phase out this type of confined housing and maximize the time that pregnant sows spend in a group environment."
Our commitment is guided by the industry - and American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV) -endorsed definition for group housing for pregnant sows.
"Since announcing the commitment in 2012, McDonalds and our supplier partners have worked diligently to meet this goal and remain dedicated to achieving it, engaging with industry -wide stakeholders to share our vision with an ongoing focus to driving progress at scale."
"In 2017, we reached a milestone to source pork for the U."
S. business only from producers who share our commitment.
"McDonalds targeted the end of 2022 for completion, however industry -wide challenges for farmers and producers such as the impacts fr om global outbreaks of African Swine Fever and the COVID -19 pandemic have delayed progress for producers and interrupted business."
"By the end of 2022, we expect 85 to 90 % of our U."
"S. pork volumes will be sourced by suppliers from producers in conformity w ith our commitment, representing material progress against our original 10 -year timeframe."
McDonalds currently buys nearly 175 million pounds of pork sourced from a group housing environment for pregnant sows.
"Due to these challenges, McDonalds has exten ded the timeframe for achievement of this commitment by two years."
Phasing out the use of gestational stalls for pregnant sows in the U.
S. is an objective that remains vital to McDonalds business and builds on our decades -long commitment to animal health and welfare.
"We remain committed to this journey, and we are on track to achieve our target by the end of 2024."
"We will continue to transparently communicate progress on this target, in lockstep with our supplier partners."
Sourcing Cage -Free and Free -Rang e Eggs The U.
"S. egg supply chain is now more than 74% cage -free as of the end of 2021, and in 2021 we sourced more than 1.3 billion cage -free eggs for our McDonalds U."
S. restaurants.
"Canada sources more than 57% cage -free eggs, and in 2021 we sourced more than 79 million cage -free eggs for our McDonalds Canadian restaurants."
Australias egg supply chain is 100% cage -free.
"Weve been cage -free for the breakfast menu in all European markets since 2011 (except Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine, whi ch account for approximately 6% of whole eggs in Europe)."
62 All of the eggs used in our menu and as ingredients in McDonalds Netherlands products are free -range.
"France, Germany and the U."
K. have also achieved a 100% cage -free egg supply chain.
"Footnotes 1 These commitments apply to chicken raised for sale at McDonalds restaurants in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, U."
"K., and U."
"S. 2 For systems with mortality rates above t his target, a year -on-year reduction of 20% should be achieved."
"63 Farming Communities Why It Matters We count on our suppliers to bring us quality ingredients and products, so that we can serve delicious meals to every customer in every McDonalds restaurant."
"We depend on the success, resilience and sustainability of the many businesses across our supply chain."
"At the heart of our supply chain are the farmers, ranchers, growers and producers who grow our ingredients, and we want every one of them to thrive from large agricultural businesses to smallholders and family farms."
"We believe the key to this is to drive positive social, economic and environmental benefits for everyone."
This is even more urgent today because farming communities have been facing significant pressure from environmental challenges to the recent economic and social impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic.
Our Strategy The strength and resiliency of our supply chain comes from our strong collaborations and partnerships.
"We work closely with suppliers to support economically viable farming and improve access to knowledge, tools and best practice farming methods that lead to positive social, economic and environmental benefits."
"Recognizing Leading Farmers 64 By helping to enable peer -to-peer knowledge sharing, we want to positively impact farmers ability to increase their efficiency, productivi ty and profitability while preserving the planet over the long term."
This is why weve launched programs such as McDonalds Flagship Farmers Program to recognize leading farmers and encourage knowledge sh aring across the farming community.
"Our Flagship Farmers Program harnesses the knowledge and experiences of forward - thinking farmers, ranchers, producers and growers who are passionate about agricultural sustainability and sharing the best practices they use to supply our ingredients."
"By inspiring, engaging and collaborating with other farmers, individual producers can help drive positive change."
"Applying field -proven best practices is one way in which we believe farmers can address critical challenges, make positive contributions to nature and ensure long -term viability."
"Investing in Farming Communities Through partnerships with our suppliers and expert gr oups, we are investing in programs that support farmers and their livelihoods to enhance their resilience in the face of multiple challenges, including changing weather patterns and labor shortages."
"When it comes to coffee, McDonalds launched the McCafe S ustainability Improvement Platform (McCafe SIP) in partnership with Conservation International and our coffee roasters."
"McCafe SIP is a framework to engage and guide our coffee supply chain in sustainable sourc ing, as well as invest in coffee growers and their communities over the long term."
"McCafe SIP is currently active in five countries across South and Central America, reaching nearly 6,000 farms as of 2019."
"McDonalds and our Franchisees partner with roaste rs to invest in programs that provide, for example, direct premiums to farmers to support economic viability, as well as farmer training, technical assistance, tools and resources, and measurement and evaluation."
"Together, we can help them better care for the land, increase their overall productivity and improve the quality of the coffee they produce."
We have also created an Advisory Council to provide input on the strategic direction of McCafe SIP.
"The Advisory Council members include Conservation Internat ional, the Rainforest Alliance, Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA), Solidaridad, Sustainable Food Lab and Fair Trade USA."
"In partnership with Conservation International and with input from the Advisory Council, we developed and introduced a set of minimum requirements that all farms must meet and that will be assessed through third -party audits."
"These requirements are focused on social and environmental impacts such as human rights, health and safety, and deforestation."
"In partnership with COSA, we have also expanded performance metrics that measure continuous improvement toward social, environmental and economic standards annually."
"Through analysis of these metrics, our roasters can better target 65 investments in programs that support income divers ification or food security and help to build the resilience of these communities."
Theres leadership coming out of some surprising places.
Companies like McDonalds are actually leading the field now.
They're doing a lot more than some very visible coffee brands.
And they do sell a ton of coffee.
"Daniele Giovannucci, President of the Committee on Sustainability Assessment Accelerating Sustainable and Regenerative Farming As we continue t o listen and learn from the farming community, were focused on finding ways to work together to scale nature -based solutions, including climate, solutions, across the supply chain."
"This includes partnering with suppliers, expert nongovernmental organizati ons (NGOs) and other organizations on farmer and rancher -led programs to help scale up sustainable and regenerative farming; this not only helps to mitigate climate change but also supports farming communities to be more resilient and economically viable f or the long term."
"Sourcing Locally As a business of our size and scale, our ability to be agile rests on a diverse supply chain made up of local farmers, multinational agriculture companies and everything in between."
"In markets around the world, we work cl osely with local farmers and producers to source ingredients for some of our most iconic menu items."
"For example, in Romania, our Egg McMuffin is made with eggs sourced in Romania."
"Cheeseburgers in Brazil use beef, produce, cheese, buns and even ketchup s upplied exclusively by Brazilian producers."
"In nearby Argentina, the buns and lettuce in the McPollo sandwich come from Argentinian producers."
In the U.
"K. and Ireland, we have a long -standing track record of using ingredients from local farming communitie s."
"We are proud to partner with over 23,000 local farmers to source ingredients like the beef for our iconic hamburgers, the eggs for our Egg McMuffins and the potatoes for our delicious French fries."
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Our w ork on farmer livelihoods supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 2: Zero Hunger (Specifically targets 2.3 and 2.4) 66 Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth (Specifically target 8.5) Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production (Specifically target 12.2) Goal 15: Life on Land (Specifically targets 15.1, 15.2 and 15.5) Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically targets 17.16 and 17.17) Our Actions Celebrating Farmers Who Are Leaders in Their Communities We are proud to elevate exceptional producers who can encourage wider adoption of sustainable practices but who are also leaders in their communities."
"Flagship Farmer Stephen Hughes, a beef producer from western Canada, is a good example of this ."
Stephen is committ ed to working with nature rather than against it.
"Bringing together a community of people who share his desire to raise cattle in a more environmentally conscious way, he is helping to leave the land better than when he started."
"Stephen is also committed t o supporting his community and believes future generations should see sustainability as normal practice, which is why he is actively engaged with 4 -H, a nonprofit youth organization that works with young people to develop life skills and leadership."
"As a 4 -H Beef Club leader, Stephen works to promote sustainability through workshops and debates."
"By promoting this type of engagement, Stephen is teaching young people about the importance of being an active contributor to their community."
We are proud of the i mpact our Flagship Farmers Program is having through farmers like Stephen.
"Recently, the program completed its near -term objective of identifying beef Flagship Farmers in 10 of McDonalds leading beef -sourcing countries."
"That means that since its launch in 2007, Flagship Farmers has recognized 34 farmers in 17 countries across four continents."
"67 Empowering Coffee Farmers in South America Through McCafe SIP, were enabling coffee roasters to leverage their expertise and relationships at origin to innovate and advance sustainable farming practices."
"For example, in 2019 over 2,000 farmers in the Antioquia region in Colombia took part in fertilizer management training and storage training, which has in part contributed to farms seeing a substantial increase in wat er quality."
"As of 2019, 50% of farmers surveyed as part of one supplier -led program were implementing all water contamination prevention practices, up from 22% in 2018."
"In the same year, a further 1,600 individuals from over 650 farms in Valle de Cauca, Colombia, received training on record keeping, environmental stewardship and quality assurance."
"This took place as part of a course to help them become coffee quality technicians, ensuring production of high -quality coffee beans."
"Of the participants, 40% ide ntified as youth, an underemployed population, and truly the next generation of coffee stewards."
"One coffee grower who has been positively impacted by McCafe SIP is Tatiana Machado, based in Urrao, a town in Colombias Antioquia region."
"When Tatiana starte d the coffee business with her husband, she knew little about farm management."
"Through McCafe SIP, she has been able to attend trainings and receive technical assistance on a wide range of topics, such as caring for coffee seedlings and learning best pract ices for the bean fermentation process."
"All the knowledge and expertise gained has helped Tatiana improve the quality of her coffee, and she is now helping to replicate the same practices on nearby farms to uplift everyone in the community."
Supporting McDo nalds Move to Cage -Free Eggs in the U.
S.
"In 2015, McDonalds USA announced that it was committing to sourcing 100% cage - free eggs by 2025."
"This target posed a big challenge to our egg suppliers, many of whom were not set up to meet this new demand."
Thats why we are supporting our farmers as they migrate to new farming systems and processes by providing the resources and aid they need to make large operational shifts.
"By collaborating with our farmers in this way, we can work towards our own targets while supporting farmers as they move to more sustainable and profitable operations."
The U.
S. egg supply chain is now more than 60% cage -free while Canada now sources 55% cage -free eggs.
"We are proud to say that Australia, France, Germany and the U."
K. have all a chieved a 100% cage -free egg supply chain.
"In addition, all European markets have used cage -free eggs for the breakfast menu since 2011 (except Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine, which account for approximately 6% of whole eggs in Europe)."
"Investing in Regenerative Farming In the Northern Great Plains, were working with World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Cargill and the Walmart Foundation to improve regenerative grazing practices across one million 68 acres of land ."
"Meanwhile, in Nebraska, weve teamed up with Target, Cargill and The Nature Conserv ancy to invest in regenerative soil health practices ."
"These projects work directly with local farmers and ranchers, providing important p eer-to-peer learning networks, as well as technical expertise, training and tools to implement practices."
"Through these programs we can help to reduce emissions, mitigate climate change and support livelihoods, which also support achieving our science -base d target to significantly reduce emissions across our supply chain, restaurants and offices by 2030."
"As weve moved forward in this journey, were proud to farm in a way thats good for the birds, that makes our staff proud of the work they do, and results in a product consumers love."
Were really proud to be a supplier for McDonalds and we hope to conti nue our family tradition for generations to come.
"Peter Forsman, Farmer, Forsman Farms 69 Supply Chain Human Rights Why It Matters McDonalds has a complex global supply chain with thousands of direct suppliers employing more than a million people in over 100 countries."
A supply chain of this scale gives us an important responsibility to only do business with suppliers that respect the fundamental rights of their employees and partners.
Human rights are universal rights intrinsic to every human being.
"While individual states have a duty to protect human rights, we also believe that businesses like McDonalds, and our suppliers, have a responsibility to respect them within our sphere of influence."
"We know we can be a force for good in communities and em power our suppliers to do the same, always considering the impact of our decisions so that we can stand by them with confidence."
Our Strategy The success of the McDonalds System lies in our trusted relationships with suppliers.
"All suppliers must, regardl ess of the cultural, social and economic context, meet our expectations of fundamental rights for all people."
"At McDonalds, we conduct our activities in a manner that respects human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Our commi tment to respect human rights is defined in our Human Rights Policy (PDF 91 KB) , which applies to McDonalds Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries worldwide."
"Our 70 expectations of our suppliers around the world are outlined in our Supplier Code of Cond uct (PDF 1.4 KB) (""Code"")."
"In order to provide goods and services to the McDonalds System, suppliers must meet our high standards, and direct suppliers are required to commit to upholding the standards contained in our Code."
"We expect, and provide guid ance to assist, our suppliers to meet the standards for human rights, workplace environment, business integrity and environmental management contained in the Code."
We also expect suppliers to implement their own management systems in these areas.
"We expect that suppliers treat their employees with fairness, respect and dignity, and follow practices that protect the health and safety of people working in their facilities, in compliance with national and local laws."
"We also require our suppliers to hold their own suppliers to the same standards as outlined in our Code, and to create internal mechanisms and programs for handling reports of workplace grievances, including anonymous reporting."
"Our Supplier Workplace Accountability Program McDonalds has a compreh ensive Supplier Workplace Accountability (SWA) program, which supports compliance with the standards and expectations outlined in our Code."
"The SWA program aims to help suppliers understand our expectations, verify compliance and work toward continuous imp rovement."
The SWA program provides suppliers and McDonalds Global Supply Chain Team with training to understand human rights issues and our SWA program requirements.
"Built on a model of continuous improvement and education, SWA includes an online trainin g platform where suppliers can access optional tools and resources that provide guidance on human rights issues."
"In addition to our Code, McDonalds Supplier Workplace Standards and Guidance Document (SWSGD) is shared with all suppliers and provides detail ed guidance on each aspect of the Code and how suppliers and their supply chains can meet our expectations."
"For example, the SWSGD clearly explains that all suppliers should: Ensure their hiring process and that of their recruitment agencies provide peopl e employment under voluntary terms."
Maintain legally accepted age verification records to demonstrate all workers are of legal working age when they commenced work.
"Respect the right to associate, or not, with any group of their choice, as permitted by law, without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment."
71 Respect the rights of people to bargain collectively where such rights are established by law or contract.
"In 2021, McDonalds updated the SWSGD and hosted training sessions on the updated standards that reached more than 4,000 suppliers and McDonalds staff and featured interviews with external experts."
"Since the launch of the SWA program, McDonalds has engag ed with thousands of suppliers and facilities to ensure respect for human rights and mitigate risk."
"We are proud that many of our suppliers take their commitments seriously and, in some cases, have their own equally robust compliance and reporting programs that have been evaluated and approved as equivalent to McDonalds SWA program."
"We have seen an improvement in compliance overall since the SWA program began and, as of June 2021, more than 4,300 facilities are actively participating in the program."
Verify ing Compliance With Our Supplier Code of Conduct Human rights due diligence is incorporated into the SWA program through on -site announced and unannounced audits conducted by third -party auditing firms that assess compliance with our Code.
"As part of the o nboarding process to become a McDonalds supplier, suppliers must complete the required steps of the SWA program (outlined below) to verify that they can meet our expectations."
We work with a number of third -party social compliance auditing firms around th e world that have expert knowledge and understanding of local languages and cultures.
On-site audits are physical inspections of the facility and include visits to worker housing and cafeterias.
The auditing firms also conduct private worker interviews and review facility records and business practices.
"In addition, they check the suppliers compliance with each aspect of the Code, such as verifying that all workers are of legal age to work."
"As well as maintaining legally accepted age verification records, suppliers are also expected to invest in remediation systems in the event an under - age person is hired, to assist in their return to their school or support any other solution that serves the childs best interest."
"Instances of noncompliance are shared wit h the supplier, who must then produce and complete a corrective and preventive action plan to address noncompliance."
"The plan must provide specific time frames within which corrective action will be taken, root causes analyzed, and policies and procedures updated."
"In instances of significant noncompliance, suppliers are subject to a follow -up audit."
McDonalds SWA program is designed to support suppliers in meeting our standards.
"However, there are circumstances under which McDonald's will remove a supplier from the supply chain to address instances of significant noncompliance with the Code."
72 McDonalds Process for Verifying Compliance Step 1 : Online training to help suppliers understand what is expected of them.
Step 2 : Suppliers complete a rigorou s annual self -assessment questionnaire to appraise their current systems and practices.
This results in a report indicating areas for improvement.
Step 3 : Third -party firms conduct announced and unannounced audits.
"Step 4 : The auditing firm shares any nonc ompliances with the supplier, who is then required to produce an action plan to address the noncompliance."
"In the case of serious noncompliances, a follow -up audit will be carried out to monitor progress."
"Ultimately, McDonalds may remove the supplier from the supply chain."
"Ethical Employment and Recruitment Practices Fundamental to our Code is an expectation of ethical employment practices by our suppliers and their supply chain, including subcontractors and third -party labor agencies."
"Our Code clearly prohibits any form of slave, forced, bonded, indentured or involuntary prison labor, and prohibits suppliers and third -party labor agencies from retaining employees government -issued identification, passports or work permits as a condition of empl oyment."
"We also expect our suppliers to provide their own internal reporting mechanisms, to ensure their employees have a safe and timely way to report workplace concerns without fear of retaliation."
On-site audits include a review of ethical recruitment p ractices to verify that workers are employed under voluntary conditions and have freedom of movement.
This includes verification that: Workers are not charged illegal fees as a condition of employment.
Worker contracts are in the local language and signed by the worker.
"Suppliers do not retain workers government -issued identification, passports or work permits."
Understanding and Assessing Risks An important element of our human rights due diligence approach is understanding global and national huma n rights risks and using this information to evolve the SWA program.
"We assess the potential human rights risks of our supply chains through desk -based research, supply chain mapping and on -site audits, and relevant stakeholder engagement."
73 A key indicator of risk we use is the country of origin from which we are sourcing products or raw materials.
"For example, we use analysis of country -level human rights risks to help inform the audit cycles for our suppliers."
"Facilities situated in countries that are cons idered to be at high risk require more regular on -site audits, regardless of the outcome of previous audits."
"Conducting a Human Rights Impact Assessment Along the Supply Chain In order to uphold our high standards for respecting human rights, we knew we needed to better understand the human rights risk associated with the various commodities we source."
"In 2018, McDonalds engaged an external provider to conduct a Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA) at the farm level."
"The assessment enabled us to identif y that, of all of the commodities we source, palm oil, tea, coffee and timber present the greatest risk of exposure to human rights concerns, with occupational health and safety, migrant workers and decent working time identified as the highest risk areas."
"In addition to the farm -level commodity assessment, the HRIA also included a stakeholder consultation with key nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to understand how industry experts view the human rights risks associated with the production of the variou s commodities, as well as their observations on how the risks can best be mitigated."
"The HRIA findings, and the corresponding recommendations, help us strengthen human rights management frameworks to better identify, assess, prevent, mitigate or remediate salient human rights issues."
"For example, as we update our sustainable sourcing policies for specific commodities, we consider these recommendations in informing our human rights due diligence requirements for suppliers."
We also use the HRIA findings to ra ise awareness of human rights risks among our supply chain staff who procure product for the McDonalds System and have taken steps to strengthen risk management procedures and improvement plans.
"By identifying the most salient human rights issues within these supply chains, we aim to strengthen our risk management procedures, develop appropriate improvement plans and increase awareness of these issues within our business."
"In the spirit of ongoing collaboration, McDonalds also shared the informatio n from the HRIA with other brands that purchase similar commodities, and we are exploring further ways to work with the wider industry."
"Reporting Mechanisms Our SWSGD provides a step -by-step best practice process to help suppliers establish an effective gr ievance mechanism, guided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights."
"While we require suppliers to provide their workers with their own robust internal procedures to raise issues, our Business Integrity Line, and an email to 74 reach the SWA g lobal management team, are open to third parties, including suppliers and their employees, if they suspect or become aware of any alleged breaches to our Code."
Our Code explicitly states that the suppliers reporting program must protect the workers confi dentiality and must prohibit retaliation in response to reporting issues.
"Collaborating With Stakeholders McDonalds is committed to engaging with relevant stakeholders to continue to advance our approach to human rights, and we participate in relevant for ums to track and address emerging risks."
"In 2019, McDonalds convened a multi -stakeholder roundtable of human rights experts and advocates on the sidelines of the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights."
"Among the group were stakeholders from civil society, academia, the public sector, peer companies and international organizations."
The group received an update on McDonalds supply chain human rights activities and provided feedback and advice on how to advance the program.
"We believe that real, systemic chan ge throughout the supply chain requires partnership with industry."
"In 2016, we joined the ICTI Ethical Toy Program (IETP) for our Happy Meal toys scheme, bringing together industry partners to support a sustainabl e supply chain for the toy and entertainment industry."
"We also participate in initiatives such as AIM -PROGRESS , which supports responsible sourcing, and Business for Social Responsibilitys Human Rights Working Group (HRWG), which supports implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in a shared -learning forum of more than 40 companies."
Leveraging Certifications Within Commodity Supply Chains We are exploring ways to map the SWA program against commodity certifications to better understand which issues are being assessed at the farm level.
"In addition, our 2020 commodity goals for beef, chicken (including soy for feed), palm oil, coffee and fiber address human rights through c ertification schemes that help to provide human rights assurances deeper within our supply chain."
"These standards complement our overarching strategy: Beef We are working with our supply chain to expand programs that align with the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) principles and criteria, which include ensuring respect for people and communities."
"Soy (Used For Chicken Feed) We leverage ProTerra or Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) certification standards, which have criteria regarding human and labor rights, abolition of any type 75 of discrimination and forced labor, as well as esta blishing requirements for relations with neighboring communities and indigenous communities and their rights."
"Palm Oil We are committed to sourcing Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified palm oil, which aims to strengthen social development, environmental protection and economic prosperity across the sustainable palm oil value chain."
We also have expectations of our centrally managed suppliers of restaurant and par -fry oil to address human rights concerns.
"Coffee Sourcing coffee certified to international sustainability standards such as Rainforest Alliance, UTZ and Fairtrade International, and Fair Trade USA is key to our supply chain human rights strategy."
"In parallel with our certification work, we have als o launched the McCafe Sustainability Improvement Platform (SIP) in partnership with Conservation International ."
"These two approaches are complementary efforts, and we will continue to support both certification and direct collaboration with farmers as methods to achieve positive impacts."
"Fiber McDonalds leverages existing certification schemes, including Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) and PEFC -endorsed national systems, which ensure the rights of forest -dependent communities are respected."
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Throug h our efforts to respect human rights we aim to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals , a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth (Specifically targets 8.7 and 8.8) Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (Specifically targets 16.5 and 16.6) 76 Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically target 17.16) Our Actions Supporting Family Friendly Spaces Program in China McDonalds works with partners and suppliers to support working parents in the supply chain as a member of the IETP."
We encouraged Happy Meal toys suppliers to partner with IETP and their implementation partner CCR CSR to create Family Friendly Spaces at s everal facilities in China.
These have subsequently had a meaningful impact on migrant workers.
"Across China, millions of workers have to leave their children in rural villages with family and friends while they are away working at urban factories."
The pro gram reunites some of these left -behind children with their working parents during the school summer holidays .
"In 2019, 10 toy facilities took part in the program and in 2020, despite the pandemic, we had two toy facilities participate in the program."
"Th e 466 participating children, aged 312 years, attended factory -based childcare run by trained staff."
The children took part in activities and day trips that helped broaden their horizons and strengthened parent -child relationships.
An impact study of the wider program done in 2020 found that workers felt confident that their child was safe while they went to work and that the spaces allowed them to spend more time with their child.
The study also revealed a 321% increase in worker satisfaction and a 39% in crease in worker retention.
Continuous Improvement Through Supplier Workplace Accountability Program The SWA program includes an online training platform where suppliers can access optional tools and resources that provide guidance on human rights issues.
"Additionally, in 2017 McDonalds teamed up with other AIM -PROGRESS brands to provide optional training to suppliers on the importance of responsible sourcing."
"Through this coalition, suppliers around the world received training on critical human rights issues, including: Training suppliers in Malaysia on forced labor, grievance mechanisms and managing migrant labor in 2017."
"Sessions on health and safety, forced labor, working hours and social insurance for Chinese suppliers in 2018."
"Training on fo rced and child labor, wages and working hours, and health and safety for suppliers in Brazil in 2019."
"77 Collaborating With Coffee Producers Launched in partnership with Conservation International in 2016, the McCafe Sustainability Improvement Platform (SIP) is a framework to engage and guide our coffee supply chain in sustainable sourcing, as well as invest in coffee growers and their communities over the long term."
We collaborate with coffee producers to design and implement programs and deliver optional too ls and resources that aim to address needs specific to the farming community and improve farm performance.
McCafe also provides roasters who supply our coffee with guidance across four key elements they must achieve in order to have a SIP -approved program .
How McCafe SIP Works Transparency Understanding who grows our coffee and identifying all farms and farmers participating in a SIP -approved program.
Producer Collaboration Identifying needs specific to the farming community and collaborating with them and local partners to provide relevant training and tools.
Measured Performance Tracking progress against globally recognized minimum requirements and continuous improvement indicators for sustainable coffee production.
Assurance Verifying data through third -party audits.
"We created an Advisory Council to provide input on the strategic direction of McCafe SIP, with members including Conservation International, Rainforest Alliance, Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA), Sustainable Food Lab, Fair Trade USA and Solidaridad."
"The Council has introduced a set of minimum requirements focused on social and environmental impacts, such as human rights, health and safety, and deforestation, that all farms must meet and that will be assessed through third -party audits."
"In partnership with COSA, we have also expanded performance metrics, which annually measure continuous improvement toward social, environmental and economic standards."
"Through analysis of these metrics, our roasters can better target investments in programs that support income diversification or food security and help to build the resilience of these communities."
"78 79 Our Planet We Are Dri ving Climate Action and Helping to Keep Waste Out of Nature In partnership with our Franchisees, suppliers and producers, were finding new and innovative ways to reduce emissions, keep waste out of nature and preserve natural resources."
From minimizing ho w much packaging we use to investing in renewable energy and partnering to advance sustainable and regenerative agriculture practices we want to help protect our planet for communities today and in the future.
"To secure a thriving food system for the future, the food industry has an opportunity and responsibility to help mitigate the impacts of climate change and find more sustainable ways to feed people."
"Im proud of McDonalds commitment to accelerate acti on and achieve the widespread adoption of more sustainable practices, even as we navigate the impact of COVID -19."
"Drawing on the support of our Franchises, suppliers and producers we can continue to build a more sustainable and resilient industry."
"Francesc a DeBiase, Executive Vice President, Chief Supply Chain Officer 80 Our Impact Areas Climate Action We were the first global restaurant company to set a science -based target to reduce emissions in our restaurants, offices and across our supply chain."
"By 2030, we expect to prevent approximately 150 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being released into the atmosphere, the equivalent of taking 32 million passenger cars off the road for an entire year."
Were prioritizing action in areas where we h ave the biggest opportunities for impact including renewable energy.
"Our 2019 investments in renewable energy will prevent roughly 700,000 tons of carbon emissions each year in the U."
S. the equivalent of planting more than 11 million trees.
"In 2020, we also unveiled a first -of-its-kind restaurant designed to create enough renewable energy on -site to cover 100% of its own energy needs on a net annual basis."
"Packaging & Waste Were testing new packaging and recycling solutions arou nd the globe to help us reduce packaging, switch to more sustainable materials and help customers to reuse and recycle."
"Today, we are approximately 78% of the way toward our ambition to source all packaging from renewable, recycled and certified sources ."
Were also partnering to help drive change at scale.
"This includes our role as a convening member of the NextGen Consortium, which aims to advance recoverable solutions for the fiber to -go cup system, and our partnership with Loop to test a reusable cup system for hot drinks."
"Sustainable Agriculture & Beef We want to make sure the beef in our burgers contributes to a sustainable food system in which communities, animals and the planet thrive."
"We know that we dont yet have all the answers, but were engaging with expert grou ps, farmers and industry to test and scale more sustainable and regenerative practices that help protect nature, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and secure farmer livelihoods."
"For example, we have teamed up with the World Wildlife Fund, Walmart Found ation (WWF) and Cargill to improve grazing management practices across one million acres of land in the Northern Great Plains one of the last remaining temperate grasslands in the world."
These efforts help us reduce GHG emissions and enable us to progres s toward our climate commitment.
81 Conserving Forests Weve set an ambitious goal to eliminate deforestation from our global supply chain by 2030 and are committed to working collaboratively and urgently to address the complex challenge of deforestation.
"Were making important progress on the raw materials we buy in the greatest volume and where we can have the biggest impact: beef, soy for chicken feed, palm oil, coffee, and fiber - based guest packaging."
"Our ambition is to drive transformati ve practices by testing cutting -edge technology, such as satellite mapping, and sharing best practices in our industry and beyond."
"Water Stewardship Weve identified and prioritized water savings and improvement opportunities across four key areas of water management irrigation, public and staff amenities, cleaning and beverage services and we have partnered with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the World Resources Institute and our Franchisees and suppliers to develop a holistic water stewardship approach to protect this essential resource."
"Across the world, we already have locally relevant water strategies."
"For example, our US 20x2020 By Design prog ram in the U."
S. aims to use innovative design strategies to reduce energy and water use by 20% by 2020 from a 2005 baseline.
"82 Climate Action Progress Highlights 8.5% reduction in the absolute emissions of our restaurants and offices from the 2015 baseline 5.9% decrease in supply chains emissions intensity from the 2015 baseline Why It Matters We believe climate change is the biggest environmental issue of our time, with impacts that affect communities around the world: from melting ice caps and devastating forest fires, to shifting weather patterns that disrupt agricultural supply chains and threaten food security."
"As one of the worlds largest restaurant companies, we have a unique opportunity to mobilize our entire value chain to act n ow."
"In collaboration with our Franchisees, and through our relationships with suppliers, farmers and ranchers around the world, we can help to catalyze action around emissions reductions and strengthen climate resiliency."
"Reducing emissions and adapting to climate change is critical to the collective success and resilience of the McDonalds System, and our ability to feed communities today and in the future."
"While taking action on climate change is challenging and requires significant investment, we believe it will drive business 83 value in the long term by ensuring we are managing operational costs in our energy supply, improving the security of supply of our raw materials and reducing our exposure to increasing environmental risks, regulation and taxes."
Our Strategy We are working in partnership with our Franchisees and suppliers to take on climate change and transform the food system for the better.
"We have been on this journey for a number of years and we are proud that, in 2018, McDonalds became the first global restaurant company to set a science -based target approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."
"Through partnership and collaboration with our Franchisees, suppliers and producers, we committed to reduce GHG emissions related to our restaurants and offices by 36% by 2030 from a 2015 base year, as well as a 31% reduction in emissions intensity (per metric ton of food and packaging) across our supply chain."
"Pledge to Achieve Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Climate science has progressed since we first set our targets in 2018, and we are raising our ambition to meet current recommendations and guidance from the SBTi."
"In 2021, we joined the United Nations Race to Zero campaign, pledging to pu t McDonalds on the path to net zero emissions by 2050."
"In pursuit of this ambition, we have committed to evolve our current 2030 targets to align with the SBTi Business Ambition for 1.5C campaign, which focuses on reducing emissions by 2030 to keep globa l temperature rises under 1.5C."
We will also develop a longer -term emissions reduction and neutralization strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
"Taking Action to Cut Our Carbon Footprint In collaboration with thousands of Franchisees, suppliers and producers, we are prioritizing action on the largest elements of our carbon footprint."
"These include restaurant energy use and sourcing, packaging and waste, and the sourcing of key ingredients for our menu, such as beef."
"We are also contributing to the d evelopment of GHG accounting methods to demonstrate the impact of factors such as land use change and carbon sequestration to our footprint, to keep our strategy robust and resilient."
"84 Restaurant Energy Usage and Sourcing Together with our Franchisees, w e are working across our restaurants to be more innovative and efficient, with investments in areas such as renewable energy, LED lighting and energy -efficient kitchen equipment."
"Across the globe, our markets are in various phases of strategy development, and in 2020 we launched a new internal climate data and insights platform to support market -level local climate strategies and track progress."
"Packaging & Waste Packaging helps us serve food quickly and safely to our customers, but we also know that how it is designed, produced, transported and disposed of can have an impact on the planet."
Our packaging and waste strategy aims to accelerate a circular economy and design out waste to further help reduce emissions across our operations and supply chain.
"Beef Production We are one of the biggest buyers of beef in the world, and beef is one of the top three contributors to the overall carbon footprint of our supply ch ain."
"This is why we are prioritizing action in this area in partnership with our suppliers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and climate experts."
"Since 2011, we have supported and participated in global, regional and national roundtables, bringing toge ther partners to identify, develop and scale the most sustainable agricultural practices."
We request all of our globally managed beef suppliers report their actions on climate through CDP Supply Chain.
"The majority have their own climate targets, and we ar e working with suppliers to develop tailored roadmaps for key ingredients (including beef) to meet our global GHG emissions target."
We are also working with partners to advance the science around sustainable beef farming practices.
Our work with the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research and universities in the U.
"S., for example, is looking at how regenerative grazing practices can capture more carbon in the soil and increase biodiversity."
"Engaging Our Supply Chain To achieve our supply chain goals, we work closely with suppliers and producers, particularly our biggest suppliers in the product categories in which we can have the greatest impact."
We all share a common commitment to delivering action on climate and driving continuous improvement.
"We have set an expectation for all McDonalds globally managed suppliers to set climate targets, measure emissions and make reductions particularly in Scope 3 emissions in line with their broader sustainability strate gies."
"85 We work with expert partners such as CDP, an organization that helps companies manage their environmental impacts, to support our suppliers in developing their own approach to climate action."
"Through the CDP Supply Chain program, we engage with our suppliers to better understand the level of action they are undertaking across their own businesses."
"In 2021, we asked 131 suppliers to report to CDP Climate and Forests ."
"This was up from 2020 when we asked 107 suppli ers representing 79% of our global spend across food, packaging, logistics and equipment to report to CDP."
"Our supply chain focus will be on areas including: Farm management On farms, sustainability and efficiency are interconnected; a carbon footprint is an indicator of a farms overall proficiency and therefore its profitability."
"When farmers are able to optimize their resources, they also improve their economic viability and minimize their carbon footprint."
"We are improving our insight into the farming systems that supply the food for our menu, and our suppliers work with farmers to help them improve their efficiency and reduce emissions by adopting more sustainable pract ices."
Rebuilding soils Progressive grazing techniques and other agricultural practices can bolster soils ability to store carbon and improve climate resiliency while optimizing the nutrition it can provide animals.
"We support initiatives to help farmer s adopt management practices that improve soil health, and at the same time ensure that farming systems that actively sequester carbon are recognized in GHG measurements."
"Conserving forests Forests play a pivotal role in absorbing GHG emissions, creatin g oxygen and supporting ecosystems and yet around the world they are under threat from deforestation and degradation."
"Deforestation is estimated to account for 15% of the planets global GHG emissions, and presents a real risk to our shared environment, as well as our business, supply chain and customers."
"We are working with partners across our global supply chains to verify that the products sourced for our menu are not putting forests at risk, and we are committed to eliminating deforestation from our g lobal supply chains by 2030."
Read more about our work on our Conserving Forests page .
"Post -farm efficiency We are constantly looking for ne w opportunities to cut emissions throughout the rest of our supply chain, and are working on initiatives that include improving energy usage at supplier facilities, transportation efficiency and reducing food waste."
86 Keeping Our Transport and Logistics Impact Low McDonalds logistics network transports our food products more than 250 million miles every year.
"Our logistics providers are working to minimize the environmental footprint of our distribution activities by reducing the distances our products travel, moving toward alternative fuels and making product journeys as efficient as possible."
We have a twofold approach to working with our suppliers to achieve world -class logistics operations with the lowest possible environmental footprint: 1.
"Using fewer miles and less fuel through continuous routing improvements, innovations like engineless cooling and air deflectors, and ongoing driver training."
2.
Increasing the use of alternative fuels with lower emissions .
"In 2019, our two largest logistics providers, HAVI and Martin Brower (MB), also signed up to the SBTi, and committed to cutting carbon emissions from their operations by 40% per metric ton of goods delivered by 2030, respectively, from a 2015 base year."
"Since then, all of McDonal ds Global and North American independent logistics suppliers have set science -based targets, approved by the SBTi."
We also pair innovation in transportation with our efforts to eliminate waste from our kitchens and supply chains.
"For instance, rather than relying on a separate collection service, trucks in some countries back -haul waste from McDonalds restaurants when returning to the distribution centers."
"This helps to recycle waste streams, like cardboard, used cooking oil, some plastics and cups, whi le reducing mileage and emissions in the process."
We encourage all our logistics providers to use carbon -efficient fuels.
"This includes alternative fuels such as renewable natural gas created from biowaste, biofuels, hydrogen, natural gas, propane and ele ctricity."
"Where possible, these biofuels are generated from by -products rather than crops grown for food."
"In 2017, McDonalds and our logistics providers became signatories to sustainability specialist BSRs Sustainable Fuel Buyers Principles, supporting growth in the market for low -carbon vehicles."
"Managing Climate -Related Risks and Opportunities We are assessing climate risk and strengthening our collective resiliency because its the right thing to do for our planet, our communities and our business."
We look to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to guide our approach.
"In 2021, we released our Climate Risk & Resiliency Summary , demonstrating our continued commitment to disclose climate -related risks and opportunities for our business."
"Key takeaways from the summary include: 87 McDonalds has taken action on climate for years, and we are actively working toward our science -based targets that cover Scopes 1, 2 and 3, as well as sustainable sourcing goals, deforestation commitments and more."
"We are leveraging scenario modeling to u nderstand the transition and physical risks and opportunities for the McDonalds System, including our supply chain, Company offices and Company -owned and franchised restaurants."
"We pledged to put McDonalds on the path to net zero emissions by 2050, and are working with partners to define a science -based framework that will guide the future evolution of our existing targets."
"Our climate change strategy is guided and governed by a cross -functional leadership team that engages all levels of the Company, from the Board of Directors to country -level sustainability staff."
Collaborating to Drive and Advocate for Transformative Change We know that addressing climate change requires a coll ective effort across our global community.
"That is why were partnering with our suppliers, Franchisees, industry, governments, NGOs and others to take action."
"Knowing we are stronger working in partnership with others, McDonalds works with other organiza tions and coalitions to advocate for further progress on climate action."
McDonalds pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 through the United Nations Race to Zero Campaign.
"Through the SBTi Business Ambition for 1.5C campaign, we committed to evolve our current targets with a focus on reducing emissions by 2030 to keep global temperature rises under 1.5C."
"We continue to advocate for climate policy, including serving as a Leaders Circle of America Is All In (formerly We Are Still In) and recently building on our existing engagement with Ceres (see below)."
"With these networks and a coalition of businesses, cities, states, faith groups, cultural i nstitutions, healthcare organizations and universities, in 2021 we called on the United States to raise its ambition o n climate action and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement."
"McDonalds participates on the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA) Board of Directors, collaborating with other energy buyers, energy providers, and serv ice providers to navigate the complexities of the energy market."
"In 2020, we became members of the Ceres Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (BICEP) network where, alongside nearly 70 other organizations, we are supporting the development of strong climate and energy -efficiency policies 88 in the U."
S.
"Since announcing our climate commitment in 2018, McDonalds has been meeting with members of U."
"S. Congress and their staff to share our commitment to climate action and also to discuss important t opics such as recycling, soil health and renewable energy."
"We believe public policy is a critical part of the solution and our advocacy work in Washington, D."
C. is driven by our U.
S. Environmental Sustainability Policy Principles .
"Across the world, we collaborate with supplier partners and industry peers on a range of projects and to help develop tools and best practices: We are working with other organizations as part of the C -Sequ working group to help develop a clear methodology to account for carbon sequestration in lifecycle analysis (LCA) calculations."
The group aims to improve accounting techniques to provide more certainty when organizations are investing in projects to sequester and store carbon through agricultural activity.
We also support the work to define the action of methane more accurately as a greenhouse gas.
"We are members of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Land Based Technical Working Group, which is developing new technical guidance and standards on how companies account for and report emissions, reductions and removals from land use activities in their GHG in ventories."
"We are involved with the SBTi Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) Working Group, led by World Wildlife Fund (WWF), to define a pathway for 1.5C for agricultural, forestry and land -based businesses and supply chains."
We are testing and providin g feedback on the approach companies worldwide can use to set and achieve credible science based targets.
"As part of the Cool Farm Alliance, we have supported the development of the Cool Farm Tool that provides farmers in multiple countries and farming se ctors with free access to a GHG measurement system, which they can use to assess their carbon footprint."
As members of the Gold Standard Value Chain Initiative a not -for-profit established to ensure projects that reduced carbon emissions featured the highest levels of environmental integrity we work with others to test new techniques of carbon accounting in the supply chain and deal with challenges around traceability.
We support the work of the GWP* Group to examine and model the impa ct and application of the GWP* methodology to reflect the warming impact of methane 89 as a greenhouse gas.
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Our climate change work supports the UN Sustainable Devel opment Goals , a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy (Specifically targets 7.2 and 7.3) Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (Specifically target 9.4) Goal 13: Climate Action (Specifically target 13.2) Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically targets 17.16 and 17.17) Our Performance The figures below reflect our 2020 progress and the latest enhancements to our 2015 base year emissions, which have been updated based on best practice guidance on leveraging the latest methodology and data available."
"As we continue to enhance our methodology and data quality over future reporting cycles, we expect the baseline and annual progress figures to furthe r adjust."
"For our comprehensive disclosure on climate action in 2019, see McDonalds CDP Climate Chang e (2020) Report (PDF 557 KB) ."
"Goal 90 By 2030, partner with Franchisees to reduce GHG emissions related to McDonalds restaurants and offices by 36% from a 2015 base year."
"Progress As of the end of 2020, we have made an 8.5% reduction in our restaurants and offices absolute emissions from the 2015 baseline."
This means approximately 23.6% of our target has been achieved.
Once all 2019 -2021 transacted U.

S. restaurants' worth of electricity and is expected to contribute to a 22% reduction from our 2015 baseline.
"Goal By 2030, reduce emissions intensity (per metric ton of food and packaging) by 31% across our supply chain from 2015 levels."
"Progress As of the end of 2020, the emissions intensity of our supply chain has decreased by 5.9% from the 2015 baseline."
This means we are 19.3% of the way toward our target.
"We continue to partner with our suppliers to make progress, and we are seeing an increase in the number of our suppliers setting climate targets and implementing strategies to reduce emissions intensity that are tailored to their own supply chains."
"GHG Emissions(In Metric Tons) Emissions 2015 (Baseline) 2020 Gross Scope 1: Emissions 162,958 97,398 Gross Scope 2: Emissions (market -based) 1,295,123 431,395 Gross Scope 3: Emissions 49,344,096 53,704,901 Total Energy Consumed Energy 2020 Total Direct Energy (MWh) 1,887,246 % Renewable 11.8% % Grid 63.4% Our Actions 91 Improving our Climate Impact Measurement We hold ourselves accountable by measuring emissions data annually and partnering with experts to leverage leading methodologies for data collection and measurement."
"In 2020, we launched a new, internal, ent erprise -level climate tracking system that pulls together restaurant, office and supply chain climate data."
It runs parallel with our supply chain sustainability reporting system and uses common sources of information.
We also work with the CDP Supply Chai n program to integrate the actions of key suppliers on climate and forests.
The climate tracking system is also a way to share actionable data and benchmarking insights with key internal audiences in order to inform strategy development.
"We will continue to evolve the system via annual improvements on both the data quality and climate accounting methodology, as well as insights and benchmarking capabilities."
"Adding Renewable Energy to the Grid In 2019, McDonalds committed to two renewable energy projects in Texas through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs)."
"These were a first for the company and helped us join other leading corporate renewable energy buyers in adding new, large - scale, ren ewable energy to the U."
S. grid.
"Then in 2020, McDonalds completed three new VPPA transactions, with two wind farms and one portfolio of solar projects slated to be built in Illinois, Oklahoma, North Carolina and Ohio."
"Once all the projects initiated in 20 19-2021 are online, the energy generated by renewable energy projects will be equivalent to over 8,000 restaurants -worth of electricity and is expected to contribute to a 22% GHG reduction from our 2015 baseline."
"McDonalds portion of these renewable energ y projects will help to prevent approximately 2,300,000 metric tons of CO 2e emissions each year."
"In Europe, renewable energy purchases in 2020 covered over 6,000 restaurants worth of electricity across 11 markets (Austria, France, U."
"K. and Ireland, German y, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland)."
"These markets have achieved purchasing over 75% renewable electricity for their restaurants, and in many cases are at or close to 100% renewable electricity."
"Creating McDonalds First Ne t Zero Energy -Designed Restaurant In 2020, McDonalds unveiled a first -of-its-kind net zero energy -designed restaurant at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida."
"The global flagship restaurant is designed to create enough renewable energy on -site to cover 100% of its annual energy needs, and will serve as a learning hub to test solutions for reducing energy and water use."
"The restaurant includes: 92 A solar -paneled roof, photovoltaic glass panels integrated throughout the building, and solar -powered par king lot lights."
"An automated energy system and passive ventilation dining -room that circulates air and regulates temperature, allowing the building to breathe."
"Family -friendly educational elements, such as static bikes that generate electricity and il luminate McDonalds Golden Arches and tablet games that teach children and adults about renewable energy."
"To reinforce the restaurants net zero energy status, we are working towards the International Living Futures Institutes Zero Energy Certification ."
"Data and learnings from the restaurant will also inform McDonalds global sustainability efforts, including progressing towards our science -based target."
The design of their global flagship restaurant is another positive step in how McDonalds is tackli ng the climate challenge by bringing proven renewable energy solutions under one roof and educating their customers about the importance of sustainable practices and renewable energy sources.
"Marty Spitzer, Senior Director, Climate and Renewable Energy, WWF Operating Sustainable Restaurants Around the World We are focused on designing and delivering the most resource -efficient restaurants possible."
"This means minimizing our use of energy and water, and maximizing the use of renewable energy, wherever possible."
"Our Global Restaurant Building & Equipment Standa rds include minimum requirements and recommendations on issues such as lighting, refrigeration and the energy efficiency of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, as well as energy management and even the way in which buildings are constructed to optimize solar gain."
"To advance the overall sustainability of McDonalds restaurants in Europe, we also operate to Green Building Guidelines, which are part of our continuous efforts to reduce energy consumption by sharing best practice and using the la test technologies."
"Progress we are making around the world: Australia In 2020, McDonalds Australia launched its 1000th restaurant as the markets first sustainability flagship and hub for testing industry -leading sustainability innovations."
"It features 25 core initiatives to reduce its environmental impact, from energy -efficiency to water conservation to recycling, and is designed to operate with 100% renewable energy and elements like carbon -neutral McDelivery."
U.
"K. New McDonalds restaurants have 100% LED lighting, which uses 50% less energy than fluorescent lighting."
"Close to 240,000 LED lights have been installed across McDonalds restaurants, 93 right down to the bulbs in our emergency lighting."
"France With a focus on energy efficiency and water reduction, a typical McDonald's restaurant in France uses LED lighting and consumes, on average, just 7 liters of water per meal, compared to 10 to 20 liters in traditional restaurant kitchens."
"Germany We have consistently reduced energy consumptio n through modernization, employee training, energy monitoring and alarms in recent years."
"We achieved an overall reduction in energy consumption of 15%, as measured in 2019 compared to 2011."
"Due to the COVID -19 pandemic (e.g., partly closed restaurants, fewer guest visits) in 2020, we achieved an overall reduction in energy consumption of 23%."
U.
S. McDonalds U.
"S. operated an environmental sustainability program, US 20x2020 By Design."
"The program aimed to reduce energy and water by 20% by 2020 from a 20 05 base year, using innovative strategies in the design of new restaurants."
"These include LED lighting, low oil -volume fryers, high -efficiency hand dryers, toilets and faucets, and low -spray valves."

U.
"S. After two years in operation, McDonalds Chicago Flagship restaurant a sleek, glass -clad landmark in the citys architecture rich downtown received LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum certification."
It is the first McDonald s location in the U.
"S. to receive LEED Platinum certification, and the second worldwide."
"The restaurant serves as a learning hub to test sustainable solutions for future locations to meet sustainability targets through thoughtful design, construction and operation ."
China McDonalds China put in place an action plan to focus on green restaurants and green packaging.
"It expects to open more than 1,800 restaurants by 2022 and that these restaurants target LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ) certification standards in the Interior Design & Construction category, issued by the United States Green Building Council."
"For the existing restaurants, McDonalds China has been continuously updating and optimizing the energy management systems, incl uding the use of LED energy -saving lamps, as well as more efficient air conditioning and kitchen equipment."
Installing Electric Vehicle Charging Points We take a holistic approach to sustainability and that means exploring ways to help our customers reduce their own environmental impact.
"To help our customers embrace more sustainable technologies, we are in the process of rolling out electric vehicle (EV) charging points at numerous restaurants around the world."
"94 Through a collaboration with electricity producer Vattenfall, every Drive -Thru in the Netherlands will have two fast -charging points installed."
"This will enable EV drivers to charge their car within half an hour, using green electricity fully generated by Dutch wind turbines."
McDonalds Sweden has worked with Recharge (formerly Fortum) since 2012 and with EON since 2018 to establish fast chargers for electric cars in Sweden.
Customers can charge their electric or hybrid car at 64 restaurants in Sweden and an additio nal 10 - 15 restaurants will be added to the network by the end of 2021.
McDonalds U.
K. has entered a partnership with InstaVolt to introduce EV rapid - charging points as standard across new Drive -Thru restaurants.
"Creating Supply Chain Climate Action Str ategies Through our climate data and insights platform, we know which suppliers and food - sourcing categories contribute the most to our emissions."
This allows us to work with these suppliers to create strategies that support our science -based target and re duce our impact on the climate.
The first stage of this process is to share a commitment through target -setting.
"In 2019, we clearly communicated our expectations to all suppliers of the importance of setting science -based climate targets for their own bus inesses."
"We now regularly reinforce the importance of taking action during supplier webinars and reviews, while also supporting our suppliers with a Climate Action Toolkit."
"As well as target -setting, we have an expectation that suppliers will instigate emi ssions monitoring and reduction programs, and report progress through the CDP Supply Chain program."
"We now request annual CDP reports from 131 key suppliers, up from 107 last year, which accounted for 79% of our annual global spend across food, packaging, logistics and equipment."
"This encompasses all globally managed suppliers of beef, chicken, dairy, cheese, bakery and baked goods, logistics, produce, liquid products and potato."
It also includes the top 80% of our fiber -based packaging and key equipment su ppliers and additional selected U.
S. suppliers.
"This partnership approach will help us to tailor supplier -led reduction initiatives that are specific to our supply chain, as well as foster new supplier collaborations to achieve an even greater impact."
"Conv erting From Diesel to Alternative Fuels HAVI, one of McDonalds logistics suppliers, announced a five -year joint plan with vehicle maker Scania in 2017 to improve its carbon footprint."
The plan aims to significantly reduce the number of diesel -powered vehi cles it uses and convert around 70% of its fleet to alternative fuels in several European countries by 2021.
"By the end of 2019, HAVI had already achieved 37% of the target."
"95 In 2021, McDonalds Switzerland, in partnership with HAVI Switzerland, began opera ting its first hydrogen truck."
This brings McDonalds Switzerland closer to its goal of transporting 70% of McDonald's Switzerland's goods to the restaurants in a carbon - neutral manner by 2025.
Martin Brower is also continuously expanding its capabilities and use of alternative fuels.
Over 90% of its global fleet is currently capable of operating with some level of biodiesel mixes which is a big step toward carbon reduction while other alternative fuels such as natural gas and electricity become more comm ercially viable.
We are also finding ways to recycle our used cooking oil into biodiesel for delivery trucks.
"Achieving SmartWay Excellence In 2017, 2019 and 2020, McDonalds U."
"S. received a SmartWay Excellence Award for outstanding environmental performance and leadership, having been a semifinalist in 2018."
The SmartWay Excellence Award is the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) highest recognition for demonstrating leadership in freight supply chain energy and environmental per formance.
"In addition, based on the performance of McDonalds freight transportation operations in 2019, EPA has named us a 2020 SmartWay High Performer."
"Our freight partners were recognized for achieving 98% of miles, or ton -miles, as SmartWay shipped, with strong performance in areas such as data reporting and validation, educational and collaborative work, and community links."
Engaging Crew to Take Action Several markets have fou nd ways to tap into the enthusiasm of restaurant staff and engage them in initiatives to lower the environmental impact of restaurants.
"McDonalds France has developed a digital environmental management system called EcoProgress, which helps restaurant tea ms manage their environmental impact and includes a platform that provides training, tools and examples of best practice."
It also involves a countrywide annual challenge that rewards the McDonalds restaurants with the highest performance.
"Other markets, i ncluding the U."
"S. , Russia , Portugal and Sweden , run internal sustainability campaigns to engage crew around the importance of taking action on climate."
"So far, the campaigns have included activities such as competitions and quizzes, with ongoing encouragem ent for crew members to share best practice examples from their restaurants."
96 Packaging & Waste Progress Highlights Over 80% of the guest packaging sourced for McDonalds restaurants was made of fiber sources.
"The remaining 20% was made of plastic In total, 80% of our guest packaging came from renewable, recycled or certified sources 99.6% of our primary fiber -based guest packaging, was sourced from recycled or certified sources and supported deforestation -free supply chains We offered guest s the opportunity to recycle packaging waste in over 25% of restaurants in our 30 largest markets Please see our performa nce section and footnotes below for additional detail."
Why It Matters Improving the sustainability of our packaging and moving toward a circular economy are top priorities for our business.
"These strategies support our long -term business resilience, help keep our communities clean and aim to help protect the planet for future generations."
"97 We realize the linear economic mo del where we take, make and dispose of materials can create waste that harms nature and impacts communities."
Thats why we believe the future of materials needs to be circular wherever possible.
One of our biggest opportunity areas is our packaging.
It plays an important role in reducing food waste and helping us serve hot and freshly prepared food quickly and safely to customers.
"But we know that when packaging and plastic waste arent recovered or recycled correctly, it can have a negative impact on o ur planet, creating litter and pollution."
"There are systemic challenges that stand in the way of achieving a circular economy, but we want to invest and engage in strategic partnerships that advance circularity in our communities globally."
"As one of the wo rlds largest restaurant company, we believe not only that McDonalds has a role to play in addressing this issue, but that we can use our scale to help transform packaging and waste systems across our industry."
"Our Strategy We will use our global scale an d reach to implement and accelerate circular solutions to keep waste out of nature, by keeping valuable materials in use."
"To achieve this, we aim to design out waste and advance recovery and reuse of materials right across our value chain, prioritizing are as where we can have the greatest impact, such as packaging."
"Progress in Sustainable Packaging and Recycling When it comes to our packaging, we look at all aspects of our footprint and beyond."
"Its a process that encompasses a wide range of initiatives to reduce our use of packaging, switch to more sustainable materials and help our customers reuse and recycle too."
"Weve set goals to source 100% of our guest packaging from renewable, recycled or certified sources, and to recycle guest packagi ng in 100% of McDonalds restaurants, by 2025.1 We understand that recycling infrastructure, regulations and consumer behavi ors vary from city to city and country to country, but we plan to be part of the solution and help influence powerful change."
"Our Priorities: Eliminate packaging through design innovation, introducing reusable solutions and encouraging behavior change to reduce usage."
"Shift materials to 100% renewable, recycled or certified sources, and streamline the variety of materials used to enable easier recovery without compromising on 98 quality and performance."
"Recover and recycle by finding ways to scale up systems to allow for greater acceptance of recycling, and making it easier for our guests to recycle too."
"Close the loop by using more recycled materials, including recycled plastic content, in our packaging, restaurants and facilities, and helping to drive global demand for recycled content."
"The learnings and insights from this work also feed into other materials we use in our system, such as Happy Meal toys, transport packaging and building materials."
"Tackling Plastic Pollution While our g oals focus on all packaging, our plastics strategy specifically addresses how we are working to prevent plastic waste from ending up in nature."
We believe that some plastic packaging is necessary in the food industry to maintain quality and safety.
Plastic has many benefits compared with other materials.
"For example, its lighter than glass and fiber, and therefore causes fewer CO 2 emissions when transported."
"However, we know that when plastic is not recycled or recovered correctly, it creates plastic pollu tion, which is harmful to the environment, and we want to play our part in addressing this issue."
"To improve capture rates and reduce the leakage of plastic waste into the environment, we are working to: Reduce plastic in guest packaging that is hard to re cycle, is not needed for safety or functionality and is likely to leak into the environment, such as straws, plastic bags and cutlery."
Prioritize innovation of new materials and redesign of plastic packaging to be more recyclable.
We understand the import ance of streamlining plastics in order to improve recycling rates.
Our goal is to streamline material types and design packaging so that its easier for customers to recycle.
"Increase the amount of recycled plastic content used in all parts of our restaur ants, where possible, to help drive demand for plastic recycling."
"For example, using recycled plastics in trays, Happy Meal toys and interior design elements of our restaurants."
Partner with companies and nonprofit organizations to support the development and expansion of recycling programs for plastics.
Partner with Franchisees to support community -level anti -litter initiatives such as consumer communication campaigns and cleanup days.
"99 The COVID -19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of food pac kaging and personal safety equipment, such as gloves and masks, which have been crucial to ensure the safety of our restaurant employees."
"We are mindful of short -term challenges, such as additional waste caused by disposable safety wear, as well as some in crease in plastic use."
"Hygiene and safety are currently at the forefront of customers minds, and our challenge is to ensure they are balanced with long -term sustainability."
"Meeting Customer Expectations of Convenience, Safety and Sustainability Together with our Franchisees, suppliers and industry partners, we invest in research and development of new materials and packaging designs that fit our customers needs for convenience, food safety and sustainability."
"In partnership with o ur packaging suppliers, we have a holistic process on product stewardship, which includes continuous evaluation and robust testing for chemicals used in our packaging."
This helps ensure that we serve food in packaging that is both safe and functional for i ts intended use.
"We eliminated a significant subset of PFAS, including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), from all guest packaging globally in 2008."
"We also eliminated BPA/BPS and phthalates from our guest packaging in 2 013 and in 2015, respectively."
"As a next step in our product stewardship journey, we are committed to remove all added fluorinated compounds from our guest packaging materials globally by 2025.1 By the end of 2020, less than 7.5% of our guest packaging items globally still contained added fluorinated compounds."
"For these items, we continue our work to find and apply alternative coating materials that offer the right grease -resistant barriers."
McDonalds packaging materials are also compliant with the U.
"S. Food and Drink Administration (FDA), EU and all local regulatory bodies."
"We abide by all state, federal and national -level re gulations, and verify through valid chemical testing."
"Being good neighbors is important to McDonalds, which is why we're always innovating to meet our customers where they are, and making new commitments as our stewardship evolves."
One of the benefits of being a global company operating in more than 100 countries is our ability to test packaging and recycling concepts in different markets to find the sustainable solutions our customers want.
"By collecting customer feedback in our restaurants, we can identi fy the best solutions to accelerate and scale across multiple markets."
"For example, across the world, weve been trialing paper straws in place of plastic ones and running straws -upon -request initiatives."
"During earlier trials, some customers had challenge s with respect to the ease of use and durability of the straws, 100 but following continued innovation, testing and learning, we have redesigned them to address these issues."
"Minimizing Waste Behind the Counter Behind the scenes in our kitchens and supply chai n, we are working with suppliers to reduce, reuse and recycle."
"In restaurants around the world, we recycle kitchen waste materials, such as cooking oils, organic waste and corrugated cardboard used in packaging, all of which can be turned into new resource s."
"In multiple markets, our logistics providers play a key role in our commitment to reduce waste by collecting and back -hauling recyclables when they deliver supplies to our restaurants."
"This not only helps recycle material from restaurants in remote loca tions, it also reduces road mileage because we no longer have to arrange for a separate waste company to make the collection."
Collaborating to Drive System Change Addressing waste is not a challenge we can tackle alone.
"We are engaging with the wider busin ess community, expert nongovernmental organization (NGO) partners, political stakeholders and academia, as well as our Franchisees, suppliers, customers and our restaurant crew, to help drive change at scale."
We support multi -stakeholder initiatives to advance research and innovation and to advocate for policies that support the transition to a circular economy.
"We are proud to be a Principal Member of ReSource: Plastic , World Wildlife Funds platform to leverage the power of business to s top the flow of plastic waste into nature."
"ReSource provides a critical hub to help companies collectively identify, measure and advance solutions at scale."
"Over the past year, weve shared our plastic footprint data with ReSource as part of a collective e ffort to find ways to reduce plastic pollution."
"We are also members of the Foodservice Packaging Institutes (FPI) Paper Recovery Alliance and Plastics Recovery Group (PRA/PRG), along with supply chain partners and other industry brands."
These groups work collaboratively to increase the amount of foodservice packaging that is composted and recycled.
"Recent initiatives have included the creation of the Design Guide for Foodservice Plastics Recyclability with the Association of Plastic Recyclers, partnering w ith many communities to add foodservice packaging recovery to U."
"S. households, and work with composters to accept foodservice packaging in their stream."
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals 101 Our packaging and recycling efforts support the UN Sustainable Development Goals , a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastruture (Specifically target 9.4) Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities (Specifically target 11.6) Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production (Specifically target 12.5) Goal 14: Life Below Water (Specifically target 14.1) Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically target 17.16) Our Performance We track progress against our goals through supplier and restaurant reports on packaging composition, usage and waste."
We use rob ust digital reporting tools that are subject to internal and external audits.
"As we continue to enhance our methodology and data quality in future years, we can expect annual progress figures to adjust in future reporting cycles."
"Goal 1 By 2025, all of our guest packaging will come from renewable, recycled or certified sources.1 Progress 102 By the end of 2020, we were approxima tely 80% of the way toward our goal to source all guest packaging from renewable, recycled or certified sources by 2025."
"99.6% of our primary fiber -based guest packaging, was sourced from recycled or certified sources and supported deforestation -free suppl y chains in 2020."
"Goal 2 By 2025, recycle guest packaging in 100% of McDonalds restaurants."
"We understand that recycling infrastructure varies from city to city and country to country, but we plan to be part of the solution and help influence powerful change.1 Progress By the end of 2020, we offered guests the opportunity to recycle packaging waste in over 25% of restaurants in our 30 largest markets."
"In these restaurants, guest packaging is collected in customer -facing recycling bins, or collected for sorting and recycling back of house or off -site."
"In regions where infrastructure is more robust, we see greater pro gress toward our goal."
"For example, on average, just under 70% of our restaurants in McDonalds largest European markets are already providing recycling for guest packaging."
"Goal 3 By 2025, we will have removed all added fluorinated compounds from our guest packaging.1 Progress By the end of 2020, less than 7.5% of our guest packaging items still contained added fluorinated compounds.1 For these items, we continue our work to find and apply alternative coating materials that offer the right grea se-resistant barriers."
"Goal 4 By 2025, McDonalds ambition is to drastically reduce plastics in Happy Meal Toys around the globe and transition to more sustainable materials.2 Progress Achieving this goal will result in an approximately 90% reduction in the virgin fossil fuel based plastic used to make Happy Meal toys with every toy in a Happy Meal to be 103 mad e using more materials from renewable, recycled, or certified sources2 by the end of 2025."
"Over the past two years, markets like the UK, Ireland and France have rolled out new Happy Meal toy innovations already resulting in a 30% reduction in plastic use."
Were scaling these efforts globally to continue to reduce plastics from our System on our journey to design and innovate su stainably.
Our Actions Material Innovation and Packaging Design We are testing a range of new materials and designs in our restaurants around the world.
"Cutting Down on Plastics We have given our McFlurry soft serve ice -cream packaging a makeover, eliminating the need for a separate plastic lid."
"The initiative has been implemented in Australia, New Zealand, India and most markets in Asia Pacific and Europe."
"In Europe alone, this change will save more than 1,200 metric tons of plastic per y ear."
"In several markets across Europe and in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, India and Taiwan, we have also introduced a paper -based cup for shakes, moving away from the traditional plastic cups."
"In France, we launched a 100% fiber Sundae cup to replace our plastic packaging while maintaining the iconic design."
It is packaging innovations like these that we work to scale more widely across markets.
"Introducing a New Strawless Lid Across France, we have introduced an innovative new fiber lid made f rom certified sources for cold drinks, which replaces both the plastic lid and the need for a straw."
"We are encouraged by successful tests of this lid and while there are some obstacles to overcome, such as consumer acceptance of drinking from a new, less familiar material, the strawless lid could save 1,200 metric tons of plastic per year in France alone."
"In China, McDonalds has begun to phase out plastic straws for cold drinks in around 1,000 restaurants across Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen."
"By introducing a new lid that customers can drink from directly, the move is expected to reduce 400 metric tons of plastic waste per year."
"104 Additionally, in Latin America, as part of its strategy to reduce plastic consumption across the 20 markets in which it operates, our Franchisee Arcos Dorados has removed all lids and straws from cold drinks for dine -in customers."
"We are deploying alternatives to plastic cutlery in several markets, including transitioning to wooden cutlery in Australia and Europe."
"This h as led to a plastic reduction of 2,585 metric tons."
"Trials are being conducted for paper alternatives to our spoons, in a bid to find the material that meets customer preferences, operational functionality and sustainability."
"Piloting Reusable Cup Schemes In 2020, we announced a global partnership with TerraCycles circular packaging service, Loop, to test a new reusable cup model for hot beverages."
"The initiative, which is currently being trialed across select McDonalds restaurants in the U."
"K., wi ll help customers enjoy their favorite McDonalds hot drink in a reusable cup, cutting down on packaging waste."
"This new partnership will allow customers to reduce waste by choosing a durable Loop -created cup, for a small deposit."
The deposit can then be r edeemed by returning the cup to participating restaurants to be safely sanitized through the Loop system and reused again in McDonalds restaurants.
Exploring reusable packaging is part of our wider strategy to implement and accelerate circular solutions that keep waste out of nature and to shift to more sustainable packaging materials.
"Through pilots in several markets, including France, Philippines, South Korea and Malaysia, we are assessing the feasibility and impact of reusable solutions for our packag ing that also maintain the highest safety standards and convenience for in - store and on -the-go consumption."
"Finding a New Solution for Plastic Cutlery We are testing alternatives to plastic cutlery in several markets, including transitioning to wooden cutl ery in Australia and Europe, and testing paper alternatives to our McFlurry spoons, in a bid to find the material that meets customer preferences, operational functionality and sustainability."
"In France, we have transitioned our knives, forks and spoons to wood."
"These changes, paired with innovations in the packaging of milkshakes, salads and straws, will allow our restaurants in France to reduce plastic packaging by more than 2,600 metric tons."
Optimizing Packaging Weight and Size 105 We are continuously searc hing for ways to optimize packaging.
"For instance, McDonalds Taiwan is gradually switching plastic packaging and cutlery to paper and wood and optimizing packaging design to reduce waste."
"McDonalds Canada, meanwhile, has switched to napkins that are 20% smaller and produced with 100% recycled fiber."
"Across several markets in Latin America, Arcos Dorados has lightweight spoons and replaced plastic packaging such as salad plates with non -plastic alternatives."
"By switching to fiber wraps instead of card boxe s, McDonalds Netherlands has saved 250 metric tons of packaging, while in China, we have optimized the size of our cutlery and reduced the amount of plastic we use by about 10%."
We also have several packaging initiatives in test phases in the U.
"S., design ed to reduce materials currently used to produce a range of products, such as sandwich clamshells and wraps, napkins, McCafe hot and cold cups, and plastic car cups."
"In 2018, McDonalds U."
"S. j oined forces with Starbucks and Closed Loop Partners as a convening member of the NextGen Consortium , a multi -year c onsortium that aims to address single -use food packaging waste globally."
"NextGen Cup is the first initiative by the NextGen Consortium, that aims to advance recoverable solutions for the fiber, hot and cold to -go cup system."
"The NextGen Cup Challenge ident ified 12 innovative solutions for single -use cups that are functional to a high standard, minimize and streamline material use, and encourage wide recoverability."
"While we work on vetting and testing these cup solutions for potential use in the McDonalds System, the NextGen Consortium is continuing to expand its work to explore the viability of reusable cup systems, and improve and increase recycling acceptance of both the fiber and polypropylene cups through working directly with cities in the U."
"S., as we ll as through membership in The Recycling Partnerships Polypropylene Coalition."
The leadership exhibited by McDonalds and other NextGen Consortium partners demonstrates their commitment to solving a critical global waste issue and accelerating change together.
"Collaboration is critical if we are to innovate, test and scale the sustainable cup solutions of our future."
"Bridget Croke, Managing Director, Closed Loop Partners Transforming Our Happy Meal Toys For more than four decades, the McDonalds Happy Meal has lived up to its name, bringing joy to children and families around the globe."
Our customers who love the Happy Meal for the kids in their lives today also care deeply about the environment that this next generation wi ll grow up in tomorrow.
"106 With fun and safety still front and center, our ambition is to drastically reduce plastics and offer sustainable Happy Meal toys2 globally by the end of 2025."
"This transition to more renewable, recycled or certified materials for toys is already underway and will result in an approximately 90% reduction in virgin fossil -fuel based plastic use against a 2018 baseline nearly the equivalent of the population of Washington, D."
"C., eliminating plastics from t heir lives for a year."
"In 2020, McDonalds also stopped manufacturing toys with batteries or electronic components, reducing waste and improving the carbon footprint of our toys."
"In addition to these efforts, beginning in 2018, McDonalds Japan initiated a toy recycling program with the Japanese Ministry of the Environment to collect plastic Happy Meal toys and convert them into restaurant serving trays."
"In the first year, McDonalds Japan collected around 1.27 million used plastic toys that were turned i nto over 165,000 trays."
"In 2019, we expanded the program and collected 3.4 million used plastic toys, followed by about 3 million toys in 2020."
"Recovering and Recycling Our Packaging Recycling shouldnt be a chore, which is why we want to make it easier fo r our guests."
We have installed sorting and recycling points in select restaurants across our top markets and are implementing improved recycling bin signage to make the recycling process easier to understand.
"In Germany, Austria, Czech Republic and Slovak ia, our crew collects customer waste to sort for recycling, while in the Netherlands, we take the process off -site completely, sending customer waste to an innovative waste sorting facility."
"While we design our packaging to be recyclable, recycling infrast ructure varies from market to market."
"In some markets, we partner with municipalities, waste collectors and processors to find recycling opportunities for valuable parts of our customer waste, like plastics, clean paper, cups or bottles."
Keeping Communitie s Clean Our restaurant crews across the world work to keep their communities clear of litter by means of regular clean -ups in the perimeter around our stores.
"In 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic prevented us from organizing large cleanup events."
"Instead, our ow ners, operators and restaurant teams worked to prevent and clean up litter in other creative ways: McDonalds Germany used social media to raise awareness and encourage customers to dispose of packaging waste correctly."
Social distancing?
Not for the tras hbin!
"107 In the Netherlands , we increased customer awareness and reduced litter through the mass -media campaign You Bin It You Win It, awarding prizes to customers who disposed of their waste correctly."
"This campaign was followed by a series of others, su ch as the Trashdance challenge, aimed at incentivizing customers to use trashbins and clean up litter."
McDonalds Russia organized cleanups and eco lessons in over 50 cities in September and October 2020.
We also support national organizations that aim to end littering and promote recycling in communities across their countries.
"For example, in the U."
"S. , McDonalds is a long - standing supporter of Keep America Beautiful, helping to advance their work to end littering, improve recycl ing and beautify local communities across the country."
"Closing the Loop We intend to expand our use of recycled materials in our restaurants, packaging and supply chains to play our role in creating market demand for recycled content."
"Thats why in multiple markets weve incorporated recycled content in both fiber and plastic packaging, such as our coffee, frappe and sundae cups."
"We also always look to c lose the loop where we can, buying back our own recycled materials to produce new packaging, fuel, clothing or furniture."
"Reusing Cooking Oil From Fries to Fuel Our Trucks Our cooking oil is a valuable resource, even after its been used to cook our famous French Fries."
Thats why we collect and recycle used cooking oil (UCO) into biofuel across the globe.
"In some markets, we are taking these efforts a step further with our logistics partners HAVI and Martin Brower."
"In Switzerland, Ireland and the Netherlan ds, for example, we use our own UCO to fuel our delivery trucks with renewable and biodiesels, creating value out of waste while cutting down carbon emissions from logistics."
"In the UAE in 2020, McDonalds passed a major milestone when its suppliers fleet of logistics trucks traveled approximately 10 million miles running on 100% recycled vegetable oil from McDonalds UAE restaurants through the biodiesel initiative."
In the U.
"K., we work to close the loop on organic waste as well."
"Food waste from stores is collected and converted into gas and electricity, some of which is supplied to the neighbouring Arla dairy."
"The dairy supplies all of McDonalds organic milk, which is delivered in Martin Browers biodiesel -fuelled trucks, and so the circle continues."
"In France, we currently have our LOGRE system pilot, which collects organic waste and converts it into renewable natural gas for the public gas network."
"This fuel then powers our LOGRE Bio -CNG trucks, closing the loop."
"108 Recycling Coffee Waste to Make Cars In North America, we have partnered with the Ford Motor Company to recycle coffee chaff the husk of the coffee bean that peels off during roasting."
"The recycled chaff is heated and the residue mixed with other materials, before being molded into hea dlamp housings."
Turning the coffee chaff into residue enables Ford to produce components that are 20% lighter than the traditional material and also require up to 25% less energy to produce.
The use of coffee chaff as a resource shows how companies can wor k together to increase participation in the closed -loop economy.
"Recycling Ocean Plastic Waste Since 2018, McDonalds Norway has been working in partnership with a small group that makes plastic pellets from the marine waste collected by fishermen along th e Nordland coast."
"The group creates products out of the marine plastic, like sunglasses, shoes and now, 100% recycled trays for all McDonalds Norway restaurants."
"In 2020, we opened our 1,000th restaurant in Australia, which we used to test and roll out mu ltiple circular initiatives, including a circular Playplace that repurposed old play equipment into new decks, climbers, slide tubes and window panels."
"60% of the entire structure is sourced from old play equipment, while the remaining 40% of material is fully recyclable."

"111 Sustainable Agriculture & Beef Progress Highlights 10 out of 10 of our top 10 beef sourcing countries sourced beef from sustainability programs aligned with the GRSB Principles and Criteria and met McDonalds requirements by the end of 2020 10 out of 10 of our top 10 beef sourcing countries supported or sponsored beef producer sustainability groups, tools or programs that supported the wider adoption of best p ractices or measured sustainability performance by the end of 2020 10 out of 10 of our top 10 beef sourcing countries had recognized one or more beef producers as Flagship Farmers to work with peers and share their industry -leading practices by the end of 2020 10 out of 10 of our top 10 beef sourcing countries had established a pioneering research project to discover or validate new sustainability practices for beef farming related to our Priority Impact Areas by the end of 2020 99.4% of beef sourced for McDonalds restaurants supported deforestation -free supply chains by the end of 2020 Please see our performance sect ion and footnotes below for additional detail."
"112 Why It Matters As the global population grows, we need to feed more people in increasingly sustainable ways."
McDonalds can use our scale to play an important role in that effort.
"We believe that more of our food can be produced in a way that not only protects the environment and contributes positively to a thriving global food system but also helps rehabilitate and enhance ecosystems around farms through better soil health, improved water management and increased biodiversity."
"Weve made it a global priority to champion sustainability efforts across our supply chain, start ing in the areas where we believe we can have the largest impact."
We cant talk about impact without talking about beef.
More sustainable beef production gives McDonalds one of our greatest opportunities to address climate change and drive positive change in the global food system.
"As one of the worlds biggest buyers of beef, we are striving to make sure that its production contributes to a more sustainable food system in which people and communities, animals and the planet thrive."
"Weve worked alongside a diverse, global network of suppliers, farmers, ranchers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and scientists for many years."
"Through these efforts, weve collaborated with farmers and ranchers who have shown us its possible to produce beef in a way that protects and maintains native landscapes including grasslands, improves biodiversity and sequesters carbon in soils while supporting farmer livelihoods for the long term."
"Our Strategy We approach sustainable agriculture holistically and consider our impac t on the planet, the livelihoods of the people who produce our food, the communities in which they live and the well -being of the animals we rely on."
"We also want to help create positive impact, especially with beef farmers, in areas such as improving biod iversity, maintaining native grasslands and capturing carbon, as well as rebuilding soils."
"We have identified seven priority impact areas for us to address through our goals: Climate change Farmer livelihoods Protecting water resources Conserving forests Reducing food and packaging waste Respecting human rights 113 Promoting the health and welfare of animals For beef, one primary area of focus is supporting the development of national multi - stakeholder beef sustainability programs."
These programs emphasize practices that align with the global definition of beef sustainability outlined by the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) Principles and Criteria.
"In partnership and collaboration with f armers, suppliers, industry groups, academia, civil society and GRSB, we have helped establish multi -stakeholder groups in our top 10 sourcing countries that represent approximately 85% of our global beef volumes, including: The U."
"S. Roundtable for Sustain able Beef (USRSB) The Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (CRSB) The European Roundtable for Beef Sustainability (ERBS) involving Germany, France Ireland, Italy Poland and the U."
K.
The Brazilian Roundtable on Sustainable Livestock (GTPS) The Australia Beef Sustainability Framework The New Zealand Roundtable for Sustainable Beef We are committed to promoting sustainability programs across our system and taking sustainable farming practices to scale.
This includes working with experts globally to advance research that quantifies the impacts and outcomes of sustainability practices to continuously advance the science that will help solve the challenges we face.
"We also set 2020 Beef Sustainability goals, which saw us further engage key stakeholde rs across our supply chain and the industry to share best practices, develop sustainability programs and support sustainability groups, tools or programs that support the wider adoption of sustainable farming standards."
"We continue to work closely with far mers, ranchers, NGOs, scientists, industry groups and suppliers to collectively mitigate the impacts of beef production and to support the development of industry resources to help measure, benchmark and demonstrate advancements in sustainability."
"Collabor ating With Stakeholders By collaborating with relevant stakeholders, we can identify and support practices that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, optimize positive impacts and support resilient farms and farmer livelihoods."
Thats why McDonalds co -founded the GRSB in 2011 the multi -stakeholder initiative that brings together key players across the beef value chain to accelerate and continuously improve sustainability throughout the sector.
"In 2014, the GRSB members, including McDonalds, collectivel y finalized the beef sustainability Principles and Criteria."
"Recently, GRSB built on those principles to develop global goals that will help guide the beef industry over the next decade to 114 deliver measurable positive sustainability outcomes."
McDonalds sup ports GRSBs efforts and we are proud to serve on key organizational working groups and in leadership roles within the GRSB.
"The GRSB Principles, Criteria and goals are intentionally high level to allow for national and regional groups to interpret them in a locally relevant way, given the significant variation in production systems, legal frameworks, socio -political factors and climates that exist across the globe."
The GRSB Principles and Criteria are focused on five core themes: Manage natural resources responsibly.
Respect people and communities.
Care for the welfare of animals.
Ensure the safety and quality of beef.
Drive efficiency and innovation to reduce waste and improve economic viability.
"To support the delivery of the GRSB Principles and Criteria at a national level, we have worked with several national and regional multi -stakeholder platforms."
"We have helped our suppliers and other partners to establish, pilot and support programs to implement this with farmers and ranchers on the ground."
"McDonalds leadership as a founding member of GRSB helpe d drive the definition of sustainability, the development of principles and criteria and the establishment of 12 national and regional roundtables covering over 20 countries who share the same mission, vision and objectives as the GRSB."
"As a major player i n the global beef network, their leadership through our Executive Committee and expertise in our Working Groups is invaluable as the GRSB launches our goals for 2030 and as we make progress towards achieving and measuring against them."
"Ruaraidh Petre, Executive Director, Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) Reducing Emissions In 2018, we became the worlds first restaurant company to set a science -based target to reduce GHG emissions related to McDonalds restaurants, as well as reduce emissions intensity (per metric ton of food and packaging) across our supply chain."
"As beef is one of the top three contributors to the overall carbon footprint of our supply chain, were prioritizing development of our Beef Climate Roadmap with input from our suppliers, NGOs, academics and other experts."
We are in the process of developing product -specific roadmaps for meeting our Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) goals.
We also publish progress updates toward our 2030 goals annually through CDP and o n our website to demonstrate transparency and accountability.
"Based on our experience to date, weve identified four key drivers that will allow us to greatly reduce emissions intensity in our beef supply: elevating farm management; rebuilding soils; conse rving forests; and post -farm efficiency."
115 Policies and Standards McDonalds has set and communicates clear responsible sourcing expectations with beef suppliers.
"In all countries where we source beef raw material, we have traceability from the abattoirs th rough the processing plant and to McDonalds restaurants."
We audit the processors that supply our beef annually and 100% of them pass our strict requirements for food safety.
"In many of these countries, traceability systems also exist to track further up t he supply chain to the individual farms where animals are raised."
"McDonalds suppliers representing approximately 80% of our spend are asked to report to CDP on Climate Change and Forests efforts, including 100% of our globally managed beef, chicken, dairy and cheese suppliers."
We regularly update this guidance and assess emerging risks across the supply chain.
We also have a specific antibiotics policy for be ef that fits into our broader commitment to beef sustainability.
"In partnership with our suppliers and producers, our goal is responsible antibiotic use as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), aligned with the One Health approach and the 3Rs (Re duce, Refine and Replace), across our top 10 beef sourcing markets, representing more than 85% of our global beef supply chain."
Our Deforestation -Free Beef Procurement Policy was developed to ensure our Commitment on Forests is upheld throughout our beef supply chain.
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Our beef sustainability work supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals , a globalagenda to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 2: Zero Hunger (Specifically targets 2.3 and 2.4) Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Productio n (Specifically target 12.2) 116 Goal 13: Climate Action (Specifically target 13.2) Goal 15: Life on Land (Specifically targets 15.1, 15.2 and 15.5) Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically targets 17.16 and 17.17) Our Performance We set beef sustainability goals we aimed to achieve by the end of 2020."
Four of these goals apply to our top beef sourcing countries (the U.
"S., Australia, Germany, Brazil, Ireland, Canada, France, New Zealand, the U."
"K. and Poland, which collectively repre sent circa 85% of our global beef volumes)."
"The fifth goal, protecting forests, has a global scope.1 Goal 1: Accelerate Industry Progress By the end of 2020, source a portion of our beef from suppliers participating in sustainability programs aligned with the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) Principles and Criteria and that meet McDonalds requirements."
Progres s We sourced beef from sustainability programs aligned with the GRSB Principles and Criteria and met McDonalds requirements in 10 out of 10 of our top 10 beef sourcing countries by the end of 2020.
"Goal 2: Share Knowledge and Tools By the end of 2020, eng age with local farmers through farmer outreach projects to help develop and share best practices related to our Priority Impact Areas."
"Progress 10 out of 10 of our top 10 beef sourcing countries supported or sponsored beef producer sustainability groups, t ools or programs that supported the wider adoption of best practices or measured sustainability performance by the end of 2020."
"Goal 3: Promote Flagship Farmers 117 By the end of 2020, select and showcase McDonalds Flagship Farmers to demonstrate leading best practices related to key sustainability impact areas."
Progress All of our top 10 beef sourcing countries recognized one or more beef producers as Flagship Farmers to work with peers and share their industry -leading practices by the end of 2020.
"Goal 4: Pioneer New Practices By the end of 2020, set up McDonalds Progressive Farm Partnerships to trial and discover new practices related to our Priority Impact Areas."
Progress 10 out of 10 of our top beef sourcing countries had established a pioneering research project to discover or validate new sustainability practices for beef farming related to our Priority Impact Areas by the end of 2020.
"Goal 5: Conserve Forests2 By the end of 2020, all th e beef sourced for McDonalds restaurants to support deforestation -free supply chains."
Progress 99.4% of the beef sourced for McDonalds restaurants supported deforestation -free supply chains by the end of 2020.
"Our Actions Recognizing Flagship Farmers We are committed to help farmers leverage the power of peer influence to elevate, inspire and share beef sustainability best practices with one another."
Our Flagship Farmers Program helps to recognize producers who are leading the industry with pioneering sustainability practices.
Were proud to have identified and recognized Flagship Farmers across our 10 key beef sourcing regions.
"Through the program, we encourage peer -to-peer knowled ge sharing that showcases farmers leading sustainability efforts and encourages wider adoption of these practices."
"The program offers an online resource for producers worldwide that celebrates innovative solutions around issues such as soil health, sustai nable grazing techniques, animal welfare, biodiversity, ecosystem protection and GHG emissions."
"118 New Tools to Tackle Deforestation in the Beef Supply Chain As part of our global Commitment on Forests, we are working in countries and regions with publicly i dentified or projected deforestation impacts to assess and address the link with the beef we source."
"Were working with AgroTools, an ag -tech company and certified B -Corp, and Proforest, a not -for-profit organization focused on responsible production and s ourcing, to track the origin of all beef sourced for use in McDonalds restaurants from certain countries and regions."
We use techniques such as cutting - edge satellite mapping and national government data sets to determine which areas to prioritize and tra ck our sourcing from these areas by farm.
"Utilizing industry - standard definitions from the Accountability Framework Initiative, working with local stakeholders and tailoring our approach to specific factors in each priority country, we assess whether defor estation has happened at the farm level."
"This enables our suppliers to understand risk and, where required, implement continuous improvement plans with farms in order to support deforestation -free supply chains."
"Weve pioneered this approach in Brazil and have since expanded this project to include beef supplied from other priority regions including Argentina, Australia and Paraguay, and shared it through platforms, such as the Tropical Forest Alliance, to encourage wider adoption."
"Latest Insights From Rege nerative Farming Pilots The positive environmental impacts of regenerative agricultural practices, such as improving biodiversity and capturing carbon, are demonstrable."
"Were working on a number of activities in this area, including: Improving grazing techniques in the U."
S.: We launched a partnership with The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research .
We also committed to match up to $4.5 million in a re search project with The ASU Foundation for A New American University.
"The research is analyzing the impact of Adaptive Multi -Paddock grazing practices, which mimic the natural grazing patterns of wild ruminants, against continuously grazed ranches across 1 0 ranches in southeastern U."
S.
"This is helping us to identify what benefits the technique can have on the environment and farming communities, such as the potential to improve soil health, sequester more carbon, increase grassland biodiversity and promote farmer livelihoods and animal welfare."
Regenerative grazing in the U.
"K.: In Oxford, were working with FAI Farms on moving toward a regenerative grazing system."
"Focusing on activity in the soil below t he ground, cattle are a vital part of the ecosystem on the farm, contributing to soil biology with the trampling of grass and addition of dung to feed microbes to create more and better soil."
"Healthy soil draws carbon out of the atmosphere, supports farm r esilience in a changing climate and produces low -input beef."
"Qualitative and quantitative measures are being used to monitor progress, and learnings will be used to support and encourage others with the adoption of 119 regenerative agriculture techniques."
"Investing in soil and biodiversity in Nebraska, U."
"S.: In collaboration with Cargill, The Nature Conservancy and Target, were supporting regenerative agricultural practices that help mitigate climate change and improve the resiliency of land, while also achie ving other important environmental benefits for habitats and local water quality."
"This five -year project will impact 100,000 acres of land dedicated to corn production, through a joint $8.5 million investment, and has the potential to sequester 150,000 met ric tons of carbon equivalent to removing over 32,000 cars from the road in one year."
"Supporting the ranching community in the Northern Great Plains, U."
"S.: McDonalds is proud to be partnering with Cargill, the Walmart Foundation and World Wildlife Fund in a five -year project to support ranchers implementing regenerative grazing practices across 1 million acres in the Northern Great Plains."
"The Ranch Systems and Viability Planning network will provide ranchers technical expertise, training and tools, inc luding peer -to-peer learning, to implement regenerative cattle grazing practices."
"By improving these practices, we can enhance soil health and its ability to absorb further carbon from the atmosphere, ultimately reducing emissions, improving biodiversity a nd mitigating climate change."
And thats not all these practices can also help ranches be more resilient and economically viable for the long term.
This covers approximately 15% of McDonalds U.
S. cow -calf supply.
"By providing training and building ranch er networks to support ongoing implementation and improvements, the project will reach over 1 million acres."
"McDonalds will be investing a total of $1.6million over a five -year period (2020 2025) to the project, demonstrating commitment to climate action and support for the ranching community."
Developing Programs to Measure and Scale Sustainability We want to work with our suppliers to pioneer new sustainability practices that relate to our Priority Impact Areas.
"In partnership with farmers and ranchers an d other experts, were developing new approaches to beef production and helping scale them up from an online environmental footprint calculator used by farmers in France, to an animal welfare and sustainability program that has reached 3,600 farms in Ger many."
These efforts are a key part of our 2020 goals to accelerate industry progress and share knowledge and tools in our top beef sourcing countries.
"Improving industry standards in Poland: McDonalds Poland and beef producer OSI Food Solutions have been working closely for over 15 years to assure that beef produced on Polish farms is safe, traceable and farmed to good standards of animal welfare."
"By working with the Polish Beef Sustainabilit y Platform and the European Roundtable for Beef Sustainability (ERBS), this scheme has been strengthened further to help the Polish beef industry address the ERBS targets through a new sustainability platform called Cultivate."
"120 Incentivizing sustainability in Germany: At McDonalds Germany, weve helped to develop the BEST Beef program."
"Since 2010, this has engaged the entire supply chain, including 3,600 farms to take important steps toward more sustainable beef production."
"The program continues to evolve, including a revised focus on improving animal health while keeping the administration of medication to a minimum, expanding the life span of cows, reducing CO 2 emissions and ensuring animal -friendly husbandry practices for example, by promoting modern loose housing and pasture grazing."
"An industry first for Canada: In July 2018, McDonalds Canada became the first company in the country to serve Canadian beef from certified sustainable farms and ranches, beginning with its Angus lineup."
"In September 202 0, McDonalds Canada continued its beef sustainability journey with the addition of Quarter Pounder patties."
"At least 30% of the beef used in McDonalds Quarter Pounder burgers is from certified sustainable sources, according to the Canadian Roundtable fo r Sustainable Beef (CRSB) standards."
"The CRSB consists of a diverse group of stakeholders, including NGOs like the World Wildlife Fund U."
S. and Nature Conservancy Canada.
"This achievement was made possible through the completion of McDonalds Canadas bee f sustainability pilot project, and paved the way for the development of robust sustainability standards by the CRSB, which aligned with the Principles and Criteria for beef sustainability established by the GRSB in 2016."
"The third - party -audited assurance system is a locally relevant, outcomes -based initiative that recognizes sustainable practices in all parts of the supply chain, including ranchers, feedlot operators and packers."
"As a result, McDonalds Canada has been able to purchase a portion of its bee f from a fully verified sustainable supply chain."
"Reducing GHG emissions in France: We helped to establish project CAP2ER, an environmental footprint calculator that evaluates the environmental impacts within beef farming, helping to identify where farme rs can work to reduce their GHG emissions."
"To date, more than 20,000 assessments have been carried out, and we have verified that 129,000 hectares of land is being managed to support biodiversity by French beef farmers who we source from."
"Beef sustainabil ity in Ireland: Irish food board Bord Bia developed its Origin Green program, with the common goal of sustainable food production on a national scale."
"As a fellow board member of the ERBS, McDonalds works in partnership with Bord Bia, including sourcing a ll our Irish beef from members of the Origin Green program."
"The Bord Bia Sustainable Beef and Lamb Assurance Scheme is a key part of the Origin Green program, covering 34,000 farms and recognized by the ERBS."
Linking the Beef Value Chain in the U.
"S. 121 We want to accelerate industry progress, which is why we are committed to sourcing a portion of our beef from suppliers who participate in sustainability programs."
McDonalds partnered with participants from each production phase of the U.
"S. beef value cha in to define, measure and improve practices used to raise, process and deliver quality beef to consumers."
The two -year Integrity Beef Sustainability Pilot Project brought the different players togeth er to test standards and methods of measuring sustainability and share data and best practices.
"The goals were to increase efficiency, improve management practices, self -assess and document sustainability efforts, explore third -party verification of sustai nability claims and evaluate a track -and -trace program across the chain."
The more than 1.2 million 100% fresh beef Quarter Pounder burgers* produced as part of the two -year pilot project were sold at McDonalds restaurants throughout the U.
S.
"While selling the hamburgers at McDonalds may seem like the end of the beef supply chain, the Companys desire to support the beef industrys sustainability efforts and improve collaboration along the chain was the driving force at the start of the pilot project, whic h was supported by the U."
S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (USRSB).
"The pilot helped shape sustainability metrics set by the USRSB, as well as the development of the USRSBs self -assessment tool, which is a concrete resource that others in the beef value chain can use to benchmark their performance and plan for continuous improvement."
It also enabled McDonalds to support the industry in accelerating adoption of sustainability best practices.

"Footnotes 1 Beef Goals 1, 2, 3 and 4: Definitions: Sourcing refers to the purchasing activities that suppliers to McDonalds restaurants undertake to procure raw materials for products used i n McDonalds restaurants."
"In this context, sourced refers to cattle procured from last farm or feedlot prior to slaughter."
Global Roundtable of Sustainable Beef (GRSB) principles and criteria aim to define beef sustainability globally.
"The five core principles are focused on managing natural resources responsibly, respecting people and communities, caring for the welfare of animals, ensuring the safety and quality of beef and driving efficiency and innovatio n to reduce waste and improve economic viability."
"These principles allow for national and regional interpretation, given the significant variation in production systems, legal frameworks, socio -political factors and climates that exist across the globe."
"Priority Impact Areas refers to seven areas that McDonalds has identified as the highest priorities to address through the supply chain, in order to drive lasting, meaningful outcomes for people, animals, the environment and our business."
These are: Res pecting human rights; Promoting the health and welfare of animals; Farmer Livelihoods; Addressing climate change; Reducing food and packaging waste; Protecting water resources and Conserving forests .
"Farmer Outreach 122 Projects are projects that engage groups of farmers within our supply base, with the aim of supporting progress towards our Beef Sustainability Goals, through either: Supporting knowledge sharing amongst producers to support the wider adoption of best practices related to our Priority Impact Are as, or; developing tools to enable producers to measure the sustainability performance of their enterprise in any of our Priority Impact Areas and inform their on -farm decision -making."
"Flagship Farmer: A Flagship Farmer refers to a farmer, producer, growe r or rancher who supplies into the McDonalds supply chain and has been officially identified and onboarded into the Flagship Farmers Program."
This process includes a review of his or her industry - leading sustainability practices via initial application an d on -farm visit.
The intent of elevating their experiences and practices is for sharing with a broader farmer/rancher peer group.
"This sharing is primarily achieved via collaboration between market supply chain contacts at the market level, and the indivi dual farmer or rancher."
Progressive Farm Partnerships: A research project aimed at demonstrating proof -of-concept for new innovative practices.
"Given the pioneering nature of this research, not all practices trialled may be successful."
"Scope: Includes all beef raw material used in beef patties sourced for McDonalds products from beef patty manufacturers that supply McDonalds restaurants in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Ireland, France, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom or Poland."
Includes all McDonalds restaurants owned and operated by the Company and its Franchisees in these countries which collectively represent circa 85% of our global beef volumes.
"Exclusions: Beef used as secondary ingredients in McDonalds products, for exampl e as flavoring in a sauce."
2 Beef Goal 5: Conserve Forests: Definitions: Please refer to Our Conserving Forest Page for definitions.
Scope: Includes all beef suppliers to the McDonalds System and their raw material suppliers globally and all McDonalds restaurants owned and operated by the Company and its Franchisees which sell beef.
McDonalds requires all beef raw material sourced from high -deforestation priority regions to comply with McDonalds Deforestation -Free Beef Procurement Policy and meet the requirements as outlined in McDonalds Commitment on Forests .
"Countries with regions currently identified as high - deforestation priority regions for beef include Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and Australia."
"Exclusions: Beef used as secondary ingredients in McDonalds products, for example as flavoring in a sauce."
"123 Conserving Forests Progress Highlights 99.6% of our beef, soy sourced for chicken feed, palm oil, coffee and fiber used in guest packaging volumes supported deforestation -free supply chains in 2020."

124 Why It Matters Forests play a vital role in creating oxygen and absorbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
"People, plants and animals rely on forests for food, fresh water and shelter, yet they and other high value conservation areas remain under threat."
"The UN's Global Forest Goals 2021 Report , states that ""Between 2015 and 2020, deforestation, which measures the conversion of forest to other land use, stood at 10.2 million hectares (ha) per year."""
"When we fail to protect forests, climate change effects worsen, critical biodiversity is lost and livelihoods and human rights are threatened as are the natural ecosystems that we all rely on for the food we eat."
"Which is why supporting deforestation -free supply chains and promoting forests as a climate solution is not just our responsibility, it is core to our business."
Our Strategy We are accelerating our efforts and remain committed to eliminating deforestation from our global supply chains by 2030.
McDonalds has been on a journey to support sustainable food production and conserve forests for more than three decades.
2020 saw us reach a major milestone by achieving our deforestation -free goals for several of our primary ingredients and materials.
"We are prioritizing the sourcing of raw materials we buy in the greatest volume and where McDonalds can use our sourcing scale to make the biggest impact beef, chicken (soy in feed), palm oil, coffee and the fiber used in guest packaging."
Our Commitment on Forests (PDF 350 KB) and its Supporting Addendum for Commitment on Forests (PDF 491 KB) set out our vision to achieving our goal.
"The Commitment applies to all commodities and every region that we source from, and both direct and indirect suppliers to the McDonalds system."
"Importantly, our commitment extends beyond forests to other areas of high conservation value, to the people and communities around the world who depend on forests."
"McDonalds is also a signatory to the New York Declaration on Forests , a shared commitment from some of the worlds most influential countries, companies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to help end deforestation by 2030."
We are committed to driving industry transformation and suppor ting deforestation - free supply chains at scale.
"For us, supporting deforestation -free supply chains is about more than preventing forest clearances, it means using our size and position to protect biodiversity, reduce our carbon footprint and respect human rights."
"By 125 working in partnership with suppliers throughout our supply chain, we want to achieve the following: No deforestation of primary forests or areas of high conservation value."
No development of high carbon stock forest areas.
"No development on peatlands, regardless of depth, and the utilization of best management practices for existing commodity production on peatlands."
Respect human rights.
"Respect the right of all affected communities to give or withhold their free, prior and informed consen t for plantation developments on land they own legally, communally or by custom."
Resolve disputes over land rights through a balanced and transparent dispute resolution process.
Verify the origin of raw material production.
"Support smallholders, farmers , plantation owners and suppliers to comply with this commitment."
"Measuring and Reporting Progress McDonalds is committed to transparently and regularly reporting progress toward our sustainability and sourcing goals, including our Commitment on Forests."
"In addition to annual progress updates shared here, we report annually through CDP Forests."
"In 2017, we were one of the first major companies to join the CDP Supply Chain Forests group, alongside one of our largest Franchisees, Arcos Dorados in Latin America."
"Through this engagement, weve sinc e provided CDP with important information on how we are working with our suppliers to manage risks linked to deforestation."
"We recognize the challenges related to how companies report progress toward their deforestation commitments and targets, with effort s ongoing to standardize reporting practices."
"To ensure we are reporting clearly and consistently against our commitments, we work with expert partners and align our definitions with recognized frameworks such as the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi)."
"McDonalds commitments and expectations are formed based on the definitions of deforestation set out below: 126 Eliminate Deforestation refers to McDonalds global pledge to tackle deforestation, and all of the social and environmental criteria in our Commitment on Forests in our agricultural and forestry supply chains."
"In alignment with the definitions of AFi, we use the term supporting deforestation -free supply c hains below to more accurately reflect the actions we are taking to implement, measure and report progress toward our Commitment on Forests."
Deforestation refers to the loss of natural forest as a result of: i) conversion to agriculture or other non -forest land use; ii) conversion to a plantation forest; or iii) severe and sustained degradation as aligned with the definitions of AFi.
"High -deforestation priority regions are defined as countries, biomes, municipalities, postcodes or farms/ plantations that are identified as under threat of deforestation as determined through regular assessments."
McDonalds initially partnered with WWF and its Global Forest & Trade Network to assess its potential impact on deforestation in its priority supply chains.
Thi s assessment paired McDonalds supply chain data with that of the 11 world regions projected to account for the majority of deforestation globally so that McDonalds could take action to drive the greatest positive impact.
"Low -deforestation priority regi ons refers to countries, biomes, municipalities, postcodes or farms/ plantations that are classified as no or low risk of deforestation, as determined through regular assessments that rely on the latest supply chain data and trends."
"McDonalds assesses th is risk annually with third parties, including WWF, to take into account the latest supply chain data and trends."
Supporting deforestation -free supply chains refers to commodities in our supply chains that are either sourced sustainably from high -defore station priority regions and comply with the certification or verification schemes as set out below; or are sourced from low -deforestation priority regions as above.
"Additionally, we know that each commodity is different and requires a tailored approach."
"F or each one, in order to be classed as supporting deforestation -free supply chains, we require the following: Beef McDonalds requires that all beef sourced from Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Australia meets the requirements of the McDonalds Deforesta tion -Free Beef Procurement Policy (DFBPP) and the McDonalds Commitment on Forests."
"Soy (for chicken feed) McDonalds requires that all soy sourced for the feed of chicken used in McDonalds products to be either sourced from low - deforestation priority regions or, when sourced from high -deforestation priority regions, to support responsible soy production."
We support responsible soy production through the purchase of Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS) credits.
A number of our chicken suppliers to Europ e also use physical 127 certification through Proterra standards.
Soy produced in the Amazon biome meeting the Amazon Soy Moratorium requirements is also recognized as compliant when suppliers can provide proof of traceability and assurance.
"Soy - producing coun tries with regions currently identified as high -deforestation priority regions for soy include Argentina (Chaco biome), Brazil (Amazon and Cerrado biomes), and Paraguay (Chaco biome)."
"Given the complexity of soy supply chains, we consider that, unless demo nstrated, all of McDonalds sources of soy for chicken fall into high -deforestation priority regions with the exception of chicken sourced in the U."
"S. and Canada, where soy used in feed is locally produced and therefore volumes are considered low risk."
Palm oil Palm oil sourced for McDonalds restaurants or as ingredients in McDonalds products must meet the requirements of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification.
All countries are considered high - deforestation priority regions for palm oil and all volumes are required to be covered by RSPO certification or credits.
McDonalds is committed to increasing traceability by requiring physical certificatio n for the palm oil used in the McDonalds System in the greatest volumes.
"Coffee McDonalds requires coffee sourced from Honduras, Indonesia and Vietnam to be Rainforest Alliance Certified or UTZ certified."
"Further to the Rainforest Alliances activati on of a program of mutual recognition between the Rainforest Alliance and UTZ coffee certification programs, McDonalds considers both Rainforest Alliance certified coffee and UTZ certified coffee (www.utz.org) as equally meeting the sourcing requirements from high -deforestation priority regions."
"Countries with regions identified as high -deforestation priority regions for coffee include Honduras, Indonesia and Vietnam Fiber McDonalds requires that our primary fiber supply is sourced from Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Certified or FSC Controlled Wood sources with full chain of custody certification when the country of fiber origin includes Argentina, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Russia or Vietnam."
"128 Our Commitment on Forests Priority Commodities Volumes Supporting Deforestation -Free Supply Chains,* 20 20 Download Volumes Supporting Deforestation -Free Supply Chains graphic (PDF 50 KB) Since 2017, McDonalds has been collaborating with Proforest , a not -for-profit organization focused on responsible production and sourcing, and other key partners to develop a comprehensive framework to report on our commitments to conserve forests."
"Our work with Proforest aims to develop criteria, definitions and protocols for our sourcing activities, as well as implementing a strategy for engaging with our suppliers and monitoring and supporting their continuous improvement."
"Prioritizing Ac tion and Engaging Our Supply Chain An important step in our journey was to understand exactly where our sourcing was driving deforestation, and where we could take action to drive the greatest positive impact."
We partnered with the WWF and our suppliers to identify product origins and assess the potential for deforestation across five priority commodity supply chains.
"This assessment helped us determine priority geographies by pairing McDonalds supply chain data with that of the 11 world regions projected by WWF to contribute to the majority of deforestation by 2030, based on WWFs Living Forests Report ."
Our Commitment on Forests Priority Regio ns 129 Download Our Commitment on Forests Priority Regions graphic (PDF 167 KB) .
"We monitor compl iance with our Commitment on Forests to drive continuous improvement through internal and external audits of our direct suppliers, validating the volumes produced for each commodity."
"We also rely on reputable commodity - specific third -party certifications f or assurance of our soy, palm oil, coffee and fiber."
"Where suitable certifications do not exist for our priority products, as in our beef supply chain, we invest in external verification systems to map, monitor and address our impact."
"Where noncompliance i s identified, we engage with suppliers to ensure they implement tailored corrective action plans to address noncompliances and mitigate future risks."
Suppliers report to McDonalds on their progress and compliance annually.
We also require our direct suppl iers to do the same with their own suppliers.
"Tyson Foods is a proud global supplier to McDonalds, and is committed to producing quality, nutritious protein while empowering people, conserving natural resources and innovating for smart, responsible agric ulture."
We are investing to be part of the solution to climate change and recently raised our climate ambitions to be net zero by 2050.
We also established a Global Forest Protection Standard in 2020 and are working toward eliminating deforestation in our global supply chain.
"This work supports McDonalds commitment to climate action, sustainable agriculture and beef, water stewardship and conserving forests."
"John Randal Tyson, Chief Sustainability Officer, Tyson Foods, Inc."
Many of our suppliers are signatories to the New York Declaration on Forests and we rely on our trusted and collaborative supplier relationships to deliver on our 2020 and 2030 forest commitments.
"We know that the policies and expectations that 130 McDonalds sets, and the commitments and programs that our suppliers create, are watched closely, and we are encouraged by this because we know that no company can tackle deforestation on its own."
Cargill works with farmers to implement sustainable agricultural prac tices and to protect forests and native vegetation.
"To advance McDonalds commitments, weve worked together to map key forest commodity supply chains and develop a soy footprint calculator."
"Together, McDonalds and Cargill will combine our scale to protec t the planet and enhance communities."
"Pilar Cruz, Chief Sustainability Officer, Cargill McDonalds is proud to support the group of NGOs that make up the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi) as they work to create common definitions and guidance for establishing, implementing and demonstrating progress on ethical supply chain commitments in agriculture and forestry."
"We aim to drive transformative practices by testing cutting -edge technology, such as global satellite mapping, spatial monitoring tools de veloped by national governments and utilizing industry -standard definitions from the AFi to define our work."
"We have incorporated their guidance into raw material specifications for beef, while providing feedback on the practical application of this import ant set of guidance."
"Additionally, in alignment with AFi reporting expectations, McDonalds believes it critical that companies adopt a more transparent and consistent approach to tracking progress, clarifying what progress has been made at various stages of the implementation journey, as well as identifying the challenges that remain."
"We also partner with the Collaboration on Forests and Agriculture (CFA), whose focus on beef and soy in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado, and in the Gran Chaco in Argentina a nd Paraguay aligns closely with our own sourcing regions and products."
"Alongside our Latin American Franchisee Arcos Dorados, we provide continuous feedback to the CFAs framework and support solutions that help protect forests and native vegetation in the Amazon, Cerrado and Chaco."
"In 2020, we conducted a gap analysis against CFAs operational guidance."
"The Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA) , and its Latin America Working Group, is another critical partne rship that enables us to develop and implement locally tailored approaches."
"McDonalds is a member of the Cerrado Manifesto Statement of Support group , which launched in October 2017, and represents an international coalition of over 160 companies and investors aiming to eliminate deforestation in cattle and soy supply chains in Brazils Cerrado biome."
"McDonalds participation reaffirms our individua l and collective commitment to halting forest loss associated with agricultural commodity production, and recognizes the Cerrados critically important role in climate change mitigation, biodiversity, water and agricultural production."
"We are also engaged with the Good Growth Partnership , a collaboration between the UN Development Program, the Global Environment Facility, the International Finance 131 Cooperation, WWF and Conservation International, and are leve raging their tools to support the implementation of our Commitment on Forests."
"It is very exciting to see McDonalds supporting greater transparency on progress across the whole production base, allowing actions to be targeted where they are most needed t o drive sectoral improvement."
"Dr. Ruth Nussbaum, Co -founder and Director, Proforest We are pleased that, as of 2020, CDP Forests is fully aligned with the AFi."
"As a result of this alignment, CDP disclosure now enables companies to report on their level of alignment with the Frameworks Core Principles. "
"Thanks to a year in alignment with this framework, we are in a stronger position to report with transparency."
"Taking the Lead on Supporting Deforestation -Free Beef As one of the worlds biggest buyers of beef, we know the potential for positive impact in the beef supply chain is significant."
"The beef supply chain presents an opportunity that McDonalds is uniquely positioned to address unlike other major commodities, there was no established certificatio n scheme or credible process to guide companies efforts to eliminate deforestation."
So we got to work.
"In 2013, we started working with Agrotools , a certified B -Corp, to track the origin of all the beef export ed from Brazil and sold in McDonalds restaurants around the world."
"We then developed a strategy in partnership with Proforest in 2017 to define deforestation risk across the vast landscape of the Cerrado, prioritize specific locations, and assess whether deforestation and noncompliance with the additional social and environmental aspects of our Commitment on Forests were actually happening at the farm level."
This process enabled us to better monitor our beef supply chain and help our suppliers take targete d action.
"During this process, we also aligned closely with NGOs like WWF and tested emerging frameworks from groups like the AFi."
"We have since expanded this project to understand our deforestation risk and apply similar principles for our beef supplied f rom other identified priority regions: Argentina, Australia and Paraguay."
"McDonalds is also a founding member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) , and since 2011, has worked closely with industry leade rs to bring together stakeholders from across the supply chain to drive collaboration and action around beef sustainability which includes the conservation of forests."
"To support the delivery of the GRSB Principles and Criteria on the ground, McDonalds has helped set up and/or participates in national and regional multi -stakeholder roundtables in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay."
"132 In addition, we are active on the GRSBs Joint Working Group on Land Use Change, made up of suppli ers, producers, finance institutions and partners from civil society."
This group has an outcome -focused goal to ensure the beef value chain is a net positive contributor to nature.
"Our leadership in beef was also driven by the recognition that beef and soy supply chains are interconnected, as soy production has the potential to expand into existing degraded pasture land, instead of newly deforested land."
"As part of our overall beef sustainability strategy, we support a focus on intensification, which will a llow for soy expansion into existing pasture land."
"In this way, were maximizing our impact and addressing deforestation for both beef and soy by reducing pressure on forests from the expansion of agriculture."
Our Approach to Our Beef Supply Chain 1.
Pol icy Development and Adaption The McDonalds Deforestation -Free Beef Procurement Policy was developed to help implement the McDonalds Commitment on Forests in our beef supply chain in line with the McDonalds global sustainability strategy.
"This Policy applies to priority countries (A rgentina, Australia, Brazil and Paraguay) where we aim to quantify and address the link between identified or projected deforestation and our supply chain."
"Since each priority country has a distinct context, Proforest and Agrotools have helped us adapt th e Policy for each country."
2.
Risk Analysis at the Territory Level Risk analysis helps us prioritize and direct our efforts.
We divide our main beef sourcing regions into a smaller set of locations and use Agrotools TerraSafe analysis tool and national datasets to develop a score for each.
"The tool uses a range of data sources to prioritize action, such as using the local definition of forests, and maps of peatlands, environmental hotspots, and other social and environmental aspects relevant in each loca tion."
3.
"Slaughterhouse Engagement 133 We work with our direct suppliers to engage with slaughterhouses, prioritizing those with the greatest levels of supply to the McDonalds System and the level of risk, based on their location."
"Facilities must identify t he location of each supplying farm, and we prioritize these locations using the Agrotools location score."
4.
"Farm Assessments A farms location may make it a priority, but that does not mean deforestation is happening."
"Using the best available data in ea ch country, Agrotools runs a detailed assessment, using satellite imagery of the area along with data analysis, to determine whether supplying farms comply with our Deforestation -Free Beef Procurement Policy."
"Suppliers are expected to address the findings and where required, implement corrective action plans with any farms in their supply chain identified as not in compliance."
This level of detail has given us confidence in the changes that are being made in our priority beef regions and allows us to contin ue to monitor our non -priority areas as well.
It also means we can monitor and assess practices at scale and share our learnings with others.

This level of detail has given us confid ence in the changes that are being made in our priority beef regions and allows us to continue to monitor our non -priority areas as well.
"It means we can monitor and assess practices at a landscape scale down to individual sourcing areas and farms, and wor k with others to make a difference."
Confronting Challenges and the Journey Ahead McDonalds has been on this journey for some time and we have already made significant progress toward our commitments.
"Today, supported by transparent, credible data and external verification, we see significant progress toward our goal of eliminating deforestation."
"However, there is always more to do."
"Some of the challenges and future opportunities we are working to address include: A Lack of Consistent Definitions Across the Industry While a robust commitment to eliminating deforestation from our supply chains is a key part of our strategy, we acknowle dge that all organizations, including McDonalds, face challenges from a lack of common understanding on how to define forests and deforestation."
"134 Organizations such as the AFi and CFA have worked to create common definitions, and we need these to be adopte d widely to ensure everyone is working toward similar goals and using comparable reporting."
"Forests as a Climate Solution We know that corporate accounting and disclosure of GHG emissions from deforestation is a major challenge, and that reporting expectat ions on these emissions will continue to evolve."
We are committed to transparency and strengthening our reporting to help demonstrate how we are managing risks associated with deforestation.
But we recognize that we have more work to do to ensure our polic ies and implementation plan for eliminating deforestation from our supply chains are built into our overall climate action strategy.
"Our climate reduction targets include estimated impacts from land use change, and our climate impact tracking system is cap able of modeling emissions from land use change such as deforestation for cropland."
"To demonstrate the positive impact that our Commitment on Forests has had, we have started to bring together our forests and climate measurement system to improve the way w e measure the climate impact of forest conservation in our supply chain."
"We are also conducting climate scenario modeling and are in the process of adopting the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to help our C ompany, Franchisees and suppliers understand the impacts of climate change on our business including deforestation and advance our climate mitigation and resilience strategies."
"Traceability Increasing traceability in our supply chains, especially in ar eas of heightened risks for deforestation, gives us better idea of where challenges lie and how to best focus our resources and scale to effect lasting change."
"We also know that our complete supply chain emissions disclosure, including deforestation emissi ons, relies upon increased traceability."
"We have achieved significant milestones, especially in our chicken supply chain, by mapping soy sourced for animal feed with real data from our Soy Calculator, which you can learn more about below."
"Key opportunities for improving include engaging with indirect suppliers, auctions and feedlots for beef and continuing to expand soy traceability."
"We plan to expand this work to other commodities beyond 2020, continuing to understand the impacts of our supply chains."
Biod iversity Loss and Zoonotic Disease Risk The COVID -19 pandemic has given much greater exposure to the risks posed to global public health by zoonotic diseases diseases that pass from animals to humans.
There is evidence to suggest that causes of biodivers ity loss and climate change such as land use change and deforestation are potentially increasing the risk of similar 135 pandemics occurring in the future.
"This gives us an added reason to continue our work to protect biodiversity, to help protect our health i n the future."
Seeing Deforestation as a Human Rights Issue Deforestation -free supply chains are not only about preventing forest clearances they also address social and human rights issues.
"Human rights are an important element of our forests commitments and our broad Company commitments, and we are constantly seeking to strengthen our implementation of these."
"In 2020, we worked with Proforest to develop a gap analysis of our approach to address human rights in our priority supply chains of beef, palm and coffee."
"Building on insights from this analysis, we are continuing to work with Proforest to ensure robust mechanisms that embed respect for human rights in the production of these priority commodities."
"Despite the challenges we face, we remain committed to the elimination of deforestation from our global supply chains by 2030."
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Our work on protecting forests supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals , a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production (Specifically target 12.2) Goal 13: Climate Action (Specifically target 13.2) Goal 15: Life on Land (Specifically targets 15.1, 15.2 and 15.5) Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically targets 17.16 and 17.17) 136 Our Performance Goal By the end of 2020, eliminate deforestation in supply chains for our beef, chicken (including soy for feed), palm oil, coffee and primary fiber -based guest packaging sourced for McDonald's restaurants."
"Progress As of the end of 2020, 99.6% of our beef, soy sourced for the feed of chicken used in McDonalds products, palm oil, coffee and fiber used in guest packaging volumes support deforestation -free supply chains.1 Beef 99.4% of beef sourced for McDonalds restaurants supported deforestation -free supply chains by the end of 2020.2 Chicken (including soy for feed) 100% of soy sourced for the feed of chicken used in McDonalds products supports deforestation -free supply chains globally."
We support responsible soy production through the purchase of RTRS credits.
A number of our chicken suppliers to Europe also use physica l certification through Proterra standards.
"In 2020, in relation to the soy for the feed of chicken used in McDonalds products in Europe, McDonalds assessed that 17% of the volume was linked to physical certification and 83% of the volume was matched thr ough the purchase of book and claim credits.3 Palm Oil 100% of the palm oil sourced for McDonalds restaurants and used as an ingredient4in McDonald s products supported the production of sustainable palm oil and deforestation -free supply chains in 2020."
"We are committed to increasing traceability for the palm oil used in the McDonalds System in the greatest volumes, which means we are increasing our physical Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified volumes (Mass Ba lance, Segregated and Identity Preserved)."
"Our volumes of physical certified oils increased from 71.0% in 2019 to 78.1% in 2020.5 Volumes of McDonald's Palm Oil by RSPO Supply Chain Model: 78.1% Physical RSPO Certified o 0.1% Identity Preserved o 7.1% Segregated 137 o 70.9% Mass Balance 21.9% RSPO Book and Claim Credits Coffee 98.3% of coffee sourced for McDonalds restaurants supported deforestation -free supply chains in 2020.6 Fiber 99.6% of primary fiber -based guest packaging sourced for McDonalds restaurants supported deforestation -free supply chains in 2020.7 Our Actions Support of Jaguar Habitats One of the ways McDonalds has expanded its work beyond our initial forest commitment is to engage in efforts to halt conversion of ecosystems that host critical biodiversity, including forests, grasslands and savannahs, such as our support of the Instituto Onca -Pintada in Brazil."
"Apex predators, such as jaguars, are a good indication of a robust and thriving ecosystem."
"The Certificado Onca -Pintada, or Jaguar Friendly Ranch Certification, by the Instituto Onca -Pintada recognizes accomplishments related to protecting this threatened species."
"By exemplifying actions and conduct that allow for the coexistence of cattle production and the jaguar, landowners are taking a leadership role in decisions that will he lp determine the jaguars existence for future generations."
"Developing the Soy Calculator: A Critical Tool to Tackle Deforestation To meet our Commitment on Forests, we needed to ensure that the soy footprint calculation reflected the reality of the produc tion of chicken around the world."
But we and other companies lacked the tools to do so.
"To create such a tool, we engaged with suppliers such as Tyson Foods and Cargill, Franchisees and external partners to develop a soy calculator."
The tools output is based on real supply chain data gathered across McDonalds global business.
"The calculator provides an estimate of McDonalds soy footprint (in hectares and volume of soy) in the priority countries of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay by combining different par ameters related to the animal production systems in those countries."
"The chicken raw material volumes are gathered and analyzed and the summarized soy footprint is used to estimate the area for soy production, and the Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS) e quivalent premium (US$) to be purchased by McDonalds chicken suppliers to initially compensate for it."
"138 The Soy Calculator is a practical and valuable tool that not only helps us implement our Commitment on Forests, but is also an accessible resource for o ther companies on a similar journey to support deforestation -free supply chains."
"We first shared this tool at an open forum in Sao Paolo, Brazil, and we are looking to collaborate with others to widen the use of the tool."

"Supporting Jurisdictional Approa ches Jurisdictional approaches are multi -stakeholder governance, monitoring or enforcement programs at a sub -national level that tackle social or environmental challenges such as deforestation, biodiversity loss and farmer livelihoods."
"These approaches def ine relevant boundaries to enable companies sourcing agricultural commodities to collaborate with local governments, communities and producers in their sourcing region."
"McDonalds supports jurisdictional approaches because we know that by working together, we can all ensure that local laws, regional efforts and corporate policies work in concert to make regions deforestation -free."
"One of the leading jurisdictional approaches is the Produce, Conserve, Include (PCI) strategy in Mato Grosso, Brazil."
"An importa nt PCI project is the PECSA program (Pecuaria Sustentavel da Amazonia / Amazon Sustainable Cattle Ranching, formerly Novo Campo), which McDonalds and Arcos Dorados took part in alongside the Brazilian Roundtable on Sustainable Livestock, local NGOs and in dustry partners."
It aims to help eliminate deforestation in the Amazon biome and to meet the GRSB Principles and Criteria.
"The PECSA program focuses on the recovery of degraded pastures and improvements in animal management, protecting the areas biodivers e ecosystems."
"By mapping beef already sourced from the Mato Grosso region, we are exploring further ways to support the work being done there."
"Footnotes 1 Calculated as the aggregated volumes of beef, soy sourced for chicken feed, palm oil, coffee and primary fiber -based guest packaging that are supporting deforestation -free supply chains, as a percentage of the aggregated total volumes sourced of these commodities."

141 Water Stewardship Why It Matters We believe our size and scale can enable us to have a positive water impact.
"Our approach takes into consideration water conservation, stewardship, pollution, quality and use."
"Water is one of the worlds most precious resources, with supplies under increa sing pressure from climate change, extreme weather, floods, growing populations and swelling demand."
"Heavy storms and harsh temperatures made more frequent by climate change can destroy crops and contaminate freshwater supplies, impacting our restauran ts and supply chain."
We rely on agriculture which accounts for 70% of the planets freshwater use and local watersheds to make our food and drinks and run our restaurants.
"Simply put, water is vital to our business."
Existing public infrastructure will need significant investment over the next 25 years if it is to keep serving all of the needs of our communities.
"Although we expect costs to rise, we recognize our role in responsibly managing a vital resource, and playing our part in protecting the availa bility and quality of our water."
"142 Our Strategy Shaping Our Strategy In the communities where we operate, were working to conserve water and use it responsibly and efficiently."
We recognize water as an important sustainability issue area within our supply chain and restaurants.
Water stewardship practices are embedded in our sourcing requirements and we expect suppliers to use water responsibly.
"We also include it in our Global Sustainable Sourcing Guide, which we regularly update as we establish targets, assess emerging risks and develop best practice."
"We have partnered with experts like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and World Resources Institute to identify risks and create a stewardship approach that drives actions and improvements across our value chain, including sourcing, processing, transport and our restaurants."
"Franchisees and suppliers are also helping us develop this strategy, and we conducted a water risk analysis of our restaurants and suppliers in 2016 to inform our approach."
"Through the actions we are taking across our supply chain and in Company -owned and franchised restaurants, we are seeking to reduce our overall water footprint, especially related to agriculture and row crops."
"Putting Our Strategy Into Practice To gather data around f our key areas of water management irrigation, public and staff amenities, cleaning, and beverage services we conducted water surveys in McDonalds restaurants in the U."
S. in 2018.
The findings have helped us and our Franchisees identify and prioritize water savings and improvement opportunities.
Our U.
S. restaurant construction and remodel standards now include low -flow urinals and high -efficiency faucets that use less water.
"We also encourage the use of native and/or drought -tolerant landscaping, along with storm water management using rain gardens, permeable pavements, and rainwater collection and reuse."
"Water use is also a tenet of our Green Building Guidelines, which help us make our restaurants more resource efficient."
"In 2020, we advanced our water engagement strategy with U."
S. Franchisees that includes proactively upgrading to high -efficiency water equipment in the restaurants.
It also involves establishing water engagement projects in our local communities in areas of high water stress.
143 We worked closely with suppliers to manage key resources throughout the supply chain.
Water has been identified as one of our Priority Impact Areas in our supply chain.
We encourage and support our suppliers to assess their own management of water in their operation s and supply chains.
The U.
S. 2020 Supplier Facility Goals included that each facility should have an Environmental Management System in place that meets expectations of an internationally recognized standard.
"Facilities were able to choose between one of three aspirational goals to achieve, one of which was to reduce their water intensity by 20%."
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Our work on water supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals , a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 6: Clean Wate r and Sanitation (Specifically target 6.4) Goal 14: Life Below Water (Specifically targets 14.1 and 14.4) Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically target 17.17) Our Actions Reducing Water Use in the U."
S.
In the U.
"S., were keeping our hot water hot while reducing the energy we need to heat it."
"Our environmental sustainability program, US 20x2020 By Design, aimed to reduce energy and water use by 20% by 2020 (measured against our 2005 building design) using innovative strategies in the design of new restaurants."
"In a concluding study, McDonalds U."
S. 2020 prototype buildings have achieved a total water use reduction of 19% ( including a reduction of approximately 27% for hot water and water to sewer).
"Efficiency by Default in French McDonalds Restaurants 144 McDonalds France is focused on energy efficiency and water reduction: a typical McDonald's restaurant in France consumes only 7 liters of water on average per meal, compared to 10 to 20 liters in traditional restaurant kitchens."
"Saving 45 Million Liters of Water Annually in Switzerland In Switzerland, we save millions of liters each year through our urinals."
"The Urimat dry urinals, with a special siphon and large -scale float, neutralize odors and save around 45 million liters of water."
"145 Community Connection We Are Connecting Communities in Times of Need Being part of the community means supporting people every day, and especially when they need it most."
Its why we donate millions of pounds of food from our supply chain every year and hot meals from our restaurants to our communities in times of need and crisis.
"Were also so proud to support the Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC), which enables families to stay together near world -class care facilities when a child is diagnosed with a life -threatening illness."
We are committed to being good neighbors everywhere we operate.
"Whether through serving as a hub for peop le to come together over a meal or dedicating time and resources in times of need, McDonalds is making sure were there for our communities."
"This year, the global pandemic created new challenges for communities."
"In response, McDonalds suppliers and Franc hisees around the world rallied together to help in impressive, all -new ways, grounded in McDonalds refreshed values."
"Ian Borden, President, International McDonald's Corporation 146 Our Impact Areas Community Support & Crisis Response With over 38,000 locations worldwide, we are uniquely positioned to give something back to the many communities we serve."
"Because the majority of our restaurants are run by independent Franchisees, McDonalds has deep roots in communities and knows how bes t to be there for them, whether thats providing a delicious meal, volunteering in the neighborhood or helping during a time of need."
"COVID - 19 has brought many new challenges, but our McFamily has stepped up to support communities during the crisis."
Rona ld McDonald House Charities McDonalds plays an important role in keeping families together when their children are sick.
"As the founding mission partner, McDonalds has helped RMHC provide a global network of over 260 Chapters in 65 countries and regions around the world, keeping families near the care their child needs."
"Food Waste & Donation McDonalds believes that good food and precious resources should never go to waste, and we want to use our scale to help tackle this global challenge."
"Were working with our supply chain and restaurants to ensure our food serves its purpose, and were donating meals and ingredients to feed families in need in local communities across the globe."
147 Community Support & Crisis Response Why It Matters Our business thrives when our communities thrive.
McDonalds is a part of so many communities around the world and that comes with a responsibility to help support people.
"We think globally and act locally to better connect with our customers, employees an d wider society."
"With our size and scale over 39,000 locations worldwide were uniquely positioned to give something back to the communities we serve."
The global COVID -19 pandemic crisis in 2020 has heightened the importance of food security and health and safety for communities.
"Throughout it all, weve been able to be a critical resource helping feed and support the most vulnerable people in our communities elderly and isolated neighbors, families, and kids who depend on school meals."
"Our Strategy The communities in which McDonalds operates are rich with potential, but every community experiences its own challenges."
"Because most of our restaurants are run by independent Franchisees, McDonalds has deep roots in communities and knows how to best be there for them, whether thats providing a delicious meal, volunteering in the neighborhood or helping during a time of need."
148 McDonalds has also established shared value relationships with community -based organizations across the world.
These re lationships help provide us with direct insights into issues and challenges facing our communities where Franchisees are neighbors as well as business owners.
"Our community strategy focuses on three key areas: Local support Together with our Franchise es, we are proud to contribute to local communities around our restaurants across the world through sponsorship, funding and resources."
From giving kids access to free football training across the U.
"K. & Ireland, to providing grants and sponsorships to non -profit organizations in the U."
"S, we are committed to supporting the communities we serve."
Volunteering Giving back has been a celebrated part of McDonalds culture since we opened our first restaurant.
"All around the world, Company employees, Franchise es and suppliers volunteer their time, skills and energy to support local communities through our Global Volunteer Program."
"Crisis response When it comes to preparing for and addressing disasters, we primarily work through our long -standing partnership with the Red Cross."
"In early 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic affected McDonalds operations, people, customers and communities."
"We took a multi -pronged approach to tackling it from supporting our Franchisees who are small businesses facing financial pressure , to ensuring no breaks in our supply chain, and partnering with the Red Cross to support communities in need."
The Illinois Red Cross is grateful for the McDonalds corporate employees' four -day commitment to volunteering alongside us at the United Center vaccination site.
"During this time, it is critical that partners like McDonald's come together and support our community as we all work toward recovery."
"Don Herring, Chief Development Officer, American Red Cross Helping S upport the Sustainable Development Goals Our support of charitable work and crisis response contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals , a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particu lar: Goal 2: Zero Hunger (Specifically targets 2.3 and 2.4) 149 Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically target 17.17) Our Contributions Capital Investments McDonalds also makes investments that help build stronger communities around the world."
"In 2020, McDonalds investments, which include capital expenditures and taxes paid, amounted to approximately $3 billion."
"Year -Over -Year Contributions Year Capital Expenditure Income Taxes Paid 2017 $1.9B $2.8B 2018 $2.7B $1.7B 2019 $2.4B $1.6B 2020 $1.6B $1.4B Our Actions Responding to the COVID -19 Pandemic While we were faced with new challenges and business disruption resulting from COVID -19, we leveraged the strengths of our global System to manage through the crisis."
"Keeping Restaurants Running Safely During the Pandemic As the COVID -19 pandemic unfolded, McDonalds implemented elevated practices informed by guidance from health ministries in the majority of the countries where we operate, as well as through recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization."
We worked with Franchisees around the world to evaluate oper ational feasibility and to adapt and continue to serve customers where it was safe to do so.
"At the peak of the crisis, approximately 75% of our restaurants around the world were operational, the majority of which adapted to focus on Drive -Thru, delivery a nd takeout."
"We put in place operational measures for closing and reopening restaurants, protecting customers, and supporting our crew and keeping them safe."
"We continue to utilize our long -standing relationships with external experts in the fields of epidemiology, med ical, microbiology and chemistry in an ongoing effort to elevate the 150 hygiene and safety standards and procedures for our restaurants to protect our crew and our customers."
Helping Communities Access the Support They Needed The McDonalds global System step ped up to help support communities to meet their basic needs.
For example:U.
"S. McDonalds provided roughly 12 million Thank You Meals to healthcare workers, police officers, firefighters and paramedics who helped keep us safe during the pandemic."
"McDonal ds has also made commitments to support truck drivers across the country, and donated $1 million to the Illinois COVID -19 Res ponse Fund to ensure non -profits in our home state have the supplies they need during this time."
Morocco Crew members and local partners in Morocco donated and delivered free McDonalds meals to hospitals when our restaurants were closed.
"Malaysia Pro vided around 63,000 McDonalds meals to healthcare workers all over Malaysia as an appreciation for their courage and commitment during these challenging times."
"Italy - In addition to donating food and meals to charities and first responders across Italy, McDonalds, together with RMHC, franchisees and suppliers, donated 1 million to support the treatment of COVID -19 patients at a new hospital in Milan and the Vittore Buzz i Childrens Hospital."
"Ensuring Our Supply Chain Never Broke As a supply chain, we are constantly planning for natural disasters and facility closures, making contingencies to divert supply from one area to another in times of crisis."
"This resilience and forward -looking approach ensured we could provide a consistent, essential source of food to communities that faced growing food insecurity due to school closures and rising unemployment during the pandemic."
It became critical to balance supply and demand s o that we could do our part to feed communities and donate bulk ingredients and meals to those most in need.
Visit our Food Wa ste & Donations page to learn more about how we donated food to meet these needs.
Supporting Franchisees Most of our restaurants are owned and operated by independent small and medium businesspeople.
"When the pandemic hit, we knew it was critical to work w ith Franchisees around the world to support financial liquidity during this period of uncertainty."
"We granted the deferral of cash collection for certain rent and royalties earned from Franchisees , and we worked with suppliers and lenders to extend Franch isee payment terms when possible."
151 Providing Job Security for People in Germany The COVID -19 pandemic forced us to cut staff time in many of our company -owned restaurants in certain markets because restaurant hours were limited as a response to the outbreak .
"Meanwhile, grocery stores were left understaffed."
"To give McDonalds restaurant workers in Germany the opportunity to keep working, we created a unique partnership with ALDI, where workers could fill in at the grocery stores."
The top priority was to help franchisees and restaurant workers plan for the future and have a sense of security.
Volunteering to Support Our Communities Our Global Volunteer Program launched in 2019.
"McDonalds individuals from our offices and Company -owned restaurants around the world dedicate their time to support important causes in their communities, including virtual volunteer opportunities."
"Through t he program, individuals have been volunteering to help reduce barriers to employment or education for young people, support RMHC, or address the unique needs of their communities. "
"In 2020, virtual volunteer opportunities were created to allow employees t o give back to their communities during COVID -19."
In the U.
"S., employees participated in virtual career panels and resume/ job application workshops to benefit youth -serving organizations a part of the Youth Opportunity program."
"Encouraging environmental v olunteering at McDonalds Russia In 2021, McDonalds Russia partnered with a leading environmental advocacy platform, +1City, to organize clean -ups around the country."
"Volunteers were rewarded for participating in the events with free menu items, redeemable through the McDonalds app."
"Just the beginning of our partnership with +1City, users of the platform can choose to sign up for events i n 170 cities around Russia."
"This innovative approach to volunteering is increasing engagement in the communities we serve, getting employees and customers alike involved in our commitment to sustainability."
"McDonalds Global Volunteer Awards In June 2019, during U."
"S. National Volunteer Week, we launched new tools to make it easier for everyone in the McDonalds System to volunteer."
"To mark the occasion, we invited Franchisees, suppliers and Company staff to nominate colleagues who make a meani ngful difference; people who donate their time and talents to a charity they are passionate about."
"Of the 234 individuals put forward, 12 finalists and six winners were selected, each receiving a donation to their charity of choice."

"158 Food Waste & Donations Why It Matters As the global population rises, the world has more people to feed than ever before."
"Despite this, food waste is a serious global issue."
"The United Nations estimates that every year, a third of all food produced is either discarded, by consumers or retailers, or spoiled due to poor handling.1 McDonalds believes that good food and precious resources should never go to waste, and we want to use our scale to help tackle this global challenge."
Were working with our supply chain and restaurants to ensure our food serves its purpose and were donating meals and ingredients to feed families in need in local communities across the globe.
This work became even more critical when COVID -19 struck in 2020.
"We found ourselves with a food surp lus in many of our markets around the world because people were being asked to stay at home, or in some cases our restaurants were required to close due to government restrictions."
"We also saw sudden unemployment and school closures, making food insecurity an even greater threat to our communities."
Its not just about avoiding waste its about directing an essential resource to the people who need it most.
"We take seriously our purpose to feed and foster community and, whether through serving hot meals in times of need or donating surplus food from our supply chain or ingredients from our restaurants to local charities, we will continue to show up when our communities need us most."
"159 Our Strategy Our long -term objective is to ensure our quality and safe foo d is used to its full potential, starting with feeding people and their communities."
Doing the right thing takes commitment and partnership.
We work with suppliers across the globe to reduce food loss and waste in our supply chain.
We also engage with Fran chisees to reduce food going to waste in restaurants.
McDonalds has a Global Food Disposition Policy to help ensure that food is not wasted if it is not needed in our restaurants.
"The policy was put in place to support our suppliers and distributors globa lly to dispose of food in alignment with McDonalds food waste hierarchy (see below), including food donations."
"In 2020, we expanded salvage methods (including retail sales) and updated our policy so ingredients like meat, lettuce, milk and cheese could be donated directly to charities reaching communities faster and with far larger quantities than ever before."
"Our suppliers, Franchisees and crew are essential to our approach in ensuring our food supports communities in need."
"For example, in the U."
"S., we actively engage our Franchisees and suppliers in our food waste and donations strategy by providing suppliers with assistance in finding local donation partners."
We also work closely with some of our Franchisees to avoid waste as outlined in our Global Foo d Disposition Policy.
"As a result, meal donation programs like Thank You Meal , food donation efforts of our supply chain, and efforts like those of one of our Franchisees in Iowa, who donated Happy Meals, activity books and coloring supplies to support their community during COVID -19, happen throughout our system in ways that meet the needs of our local communities aro und the world."
"In countries around the world, McDonalds, our suppliers and Franchisees have quickly mobilized in response to the situation created by the COVID -19 pandemic."
"In Australia, for example, some of our Franchisee and Company -owned restaurants added staple food items , including eggs, milk and bread rolls to their regular menus during the peak of the countrys COVID -19-related lock downs, enabling customers to safely purchase essential food items theyd find at supermarkets via McDonalds contactless takeout and Drive -Thru services."
"McDonalds Food Waste Hierarchy McDonalds has developed a system to minimize food waste by aligning with our food waste hierarchy, including by enabling food donations to be made wherever possible."
"Our approach is based on global best practices2 to avoid food waste and food loss, and is a critical part of McDonalds sustainability and our purpose to feed and foster community."
"160 Minimizing Food Waste and Ensuring Supply Every day, in over 100 countries ar ound the world, we source beef, chicken, pork, fish, fresh produce and other ingredients from hundreds of local and global suppliers."
"Over the decades, we have developed strong, trusted supplier relationships, making it possible for us to reliably feed mil lions of customers around the world."
"Through these relationships, we are able to minimize food waste by working together to design and implement efficient production practices throughout our supply chain."
"Our suppliers in turn make sure that their producti on processes use raw materials and ingredients, such as butter and eggs, in a well -managed way when making products for our menu, like a burger bun or bakery item."
We are constantly learning and evolving.
"There are many levers we can pull to maintain contr ol of inventory, ensure supply for our customers and avoid waste."
"During the COVID -19 pandemic, we moved quickly to further diversify our beef supply chain in the U."
S. by adding new local suppliers and sourcing additional products globally where needed.
"Helping Support the Sustainable Development Goals Our efforts to minimize waste in our kitchens and supply chain help support the UN Sustainable Development Goals , a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, in particular: Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities (Specifically target 11.6) Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production (Specifically targets 12.3 and 12.5) Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals (Specifically target 17.16) 161 Our Actions Supporting Communities During the COVID -19 Pandemic The COVID -19 pandemic called on us to deepen our commitment to communities."
We leveraged our supply chain to get more quality food to our nongovernmental organization (NGO) partners to help feed communities and ensure as little as possibl e went to waste.
"As a global corporation, we have over 39,000 restaurants in 119 countries."
This means that donating food or supplies isnt straightforward.
"Our Franchisees, suppliers and distribution centers around the world have always given back to thei r communities and implemented measures to avoid food waste."
"However, throughout the COVID -19 pandemic, and with the guidance of existing and new partners like Food Donation Connection (FDC), The Global Foodbanking Network (GFN) and Feeding America, we have made sure that millions of pounds of stranded food has not gone to waste."
"Instead, that food has helped to feed people who need it in thousands of local communities around the world."
"Getting food to men, women and children in need is at the core of our mission."
We are excited to support our food banks as they partner with McDonalds to reach communities around the world who are facing additional challenges due to the impact of COVID -19.

"166 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Why It Matters Our global aspiration is that no matter where you are in the world, when you interact with McDonalds through the app, in a restaurant, by watching a commercial, working in an office setting or as a crew member Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are as evident and familiar as the Arches themselves."
"Our aspiration is to ensure at every interaction, all are welcome, comfortable and safe, because we commit to delivering equitable treatment for all."
"This means the full expression of diversity: the representation and inclusion of different genders, races, cultures, identities, sexual orientations, ages, religions, abilities, langua ges, experiences and expressions."
We aim to identify and eliminate barriers to fair treatment for underrepresented groups.
"When we talk about equity in the workplace, we mean fair treatment in access, opportunity and advancement for all."

Few companies on the planet are better positioned to make a difference than McDonalds.
"We feed more people, reach more markets, and serve more communities than any other restaurant company in the world."
"When w e harness our scale to change the System, theres no telling how much impact we can help make."
"167 Our Strategy Living our values means extending them to everyone: from the tens of millions of people who visit us daily, work in our restaurants and our corporate offices, to t he communities we feed and foster."
"Rather than hear we care about diversity, equity and inclusion, our communities need to experience it."
"We will pursue this aspiration by using McDonald's influence and scale to accelerate meaningful and overdue societal c hange for our employees, Franchisees, suppliers, customers and communities."
This means striving to: Represent the diverse communities in which we operate.
Accelerate cultures of inclusion and belonging.
Dismantle barriers to economic opportunity.
"Increasing Representation in Corporate Leadership We seek to represent the diverse communities in which we operate by increasing the diversity of our leadership through the following goals: By the end of 2025, McDonalds expects to increase representation of historically underrepresented groups1 in leadership roles (Senior Director and above) located in the U."
"S. to 35%.2 By the end of 2025, McDonalds expects to increase representation of women in leadership roles globa lly (Senior Director and above) to 45%3, with an overall goal to reach gender parity globally in leadership r oles (Senior Director and above) by the end of 2030.4 In setting these goals, we leveraged data to understand where we are currently, and where we want to be in the future."
"This included a review of internal and external data, including labor and census talent availability statistics, industry EEO -1 data, consumer insights, customer trends and expected demographi c changes over the next 10 years."
These insights made it clear that we have an opportunity to strengthen our representation to better represent our current and future base.
We are helping drive change by giving leaders direct responsibility and accountabil ity for making tangible progress on our DEI goals.
"Beginning in 2021, the Company has incorporated quantitative metrics related to human capital management into annual incentive compensation awards for its CEO and Executive Vice Presidents."
"In addition to financial performance, executives will be measured on their ability to champion our core values, improve representation within leadership roles for women and historically underrepresented groups, and create a strong culture of inclusion within the Company."
"168 Equal Pay As we continue to emphasize action, accountability, and integrity as we make progress against our DEI strategy, we have prioritized our work around equal pay, a critical issue that sits at the nexus of all five of our Values."
"Through an annual analysis of our compensation data, followed by appropriate remediation action, we are committed to help ensure equal pay for equal work."

"S. supply chain in 20206, an industry -leading 23% of which is with diverse -owned suppliers meaning businesses that are 51% owned and controlled by women and/or Black, Hispanic, Asian, Indigenous, Veteran, LGBTQ+, and disabled persons."
"We recognize that through our scale and influence, McDonalds has the opportunity to help accelerate change not just in our own business but also in those which we work with by inviting our suppliers to commit to building within their own organizations the talent pipelines, infrastructure and culture that support increased representation and inclusion, and close equity gaps."
"Starting in July 2021, US -based suppliers of goods and services to McDonalds are invited to sign a Mutual Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion."

Part of our journey to becoming a world -class supplier diversity hub is empowering our suppliers to grow their businesses beyond the McDonalds System.

173 We have also joined Catalysts Gender and Diversity KPI Alliance (GDKA)7 and pledge to adopt Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure and improve diversity in our organization.
Our organization is committed to evaluating the following indicators: 1.
Percentage of representation on an organizations board 2.

Language barriers stifle progress towards more inclusive communities.
"In markets around the world, Company -owned restaurants and particip ating Franchisee employees can access online training to help improve their language skills and build a sense of belonging at their restaurant."
"Fostering and measuring more inclusive environments to create a stronger sense of belonging 177 In September 2020, our biannual staff pulse survey introduced an Inclusion Index."
The index asked questions designed to measure the critical components of building an inclusive culture including whether our employees feel that they can bring their whole selves to work and have equal opportunities.
The index measures behaviors and actions the company is taking to ensure that we have an inclusive environment for everyone that works for the Brand.
"The index measures attributes that are critical to being yourself at work, o ffering different opinions, and advancing through the company."
Our plan is to measure inclusion every six months to not only monitor our progress but identify areas of opportunity.
"In fact, all officers (Vice Presidents and above) will receive reports ever y six months that provide results on the index and suggest key areas of action."
The Inclusion Index is made up of five questions that measure the extent to which respondents agree with the following statements: 1.
McDonalds has a safe environment where I can bring my whole self to work.
2.
Differing views are openly accepted.
3.
I have a role model at work.
4.
Everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.

Our EBNs bring our company values to life every day and share important and timely cultural insights when situations arise within and outside of McDonalds.

"In 2021 , McDonalds announced Global Brand Standards aimed at advancing a culture of safety for everyone working under the Arches and McDonalds customers worldwide."
"All 39,000 McDonalds restaurants across the globe, both Company -owned and franchised locations, will be required to adhere to these standards."
"McDonalds is committed to supporting implementation of the Global Brand Standards with Franchisees through a suite of policies, tools, trainings and reporting mechanisms."
"190 Our commitment to respect human right s is also set out in our Standards of Business Conduct (Standards), which apply to Company employees, and in our Supplier Code of Conduct (PDF 1.4 KB) (Code), which applies to McDonalds suppliers globally."
Company staff are trained regularly on the Standards and are required to annually certify their understanding of an d commitment to upholding them.
People come to work at a McDonald's because they want to be a part of a community and grow as individuals.
Our job as employers is to make that possible while fostering an environment where those ambitions are never compromised by concerns of safety.
"As Franchisees, were developing comprehensive programs centered on building healthy relationships, trusting environments and resolving conflict to support our people in all facets of their lives at work, at home and ou t in their communities."
"Dorothy Stingley, President of McDonalds Women Operators Network, franchise owner and 36 -year veteran of the McDonalds business Putting Our Commitments Into Practice In 2018, we created a global cross -functional Human Rights Worki ng Group, which oversees implementation of the Policy and improves our procedures and practices."

Both our Policy and training are available in 15 languages.
"In addition to online training, in 2019 senior leadership received in -person training in partnership with an external human rights consultancy."

We know we have more work to do.
"We are committed to regularly assessing our approach, and engaging with relevant stakeholders to improve our monitoring, analysis and remediation of human rights impacts in order to be more transparent and effective in supporting people."
The Global Brand Standards extend requirements to all Company -owned and franchised restaurants.
"The standards are required, and all restaurants will be assessed and held accountable in accordance with the applicable McDonalds markets business evaluation processes starting in 2022."

"These standards were informed by input from perspectives across the system, a cross -functional global team and reviews of global market practices."
Ensuring Fair Reporting Processes We take seriously our responsibility to act with due diligence to avoid infringing on the rights of others and to address any human rights impacts should they occur.
"This includes encouraging honest communication with manager s and human resource representatives, when appropriate, as well as providing anonymous channels for employees to report ethics or human rights concerns."
"Company employees can raise concerns via an anonymous global channel, the Business Integrity Line staffed by a live operator from an independent company 24 hours a day, 365 days a year."
This is complemented by additional reporting channels in many markets.
We take seriously all concerns that are raised.
We will not impede state -based grievance processes via our employee system and we do not require employees to waive their right to use such external mechanisms to participate in our hotline.
"We do not tolerate retaliation of any kind against anyone who reports an issue and do not tolerate unlawful threats , intimidation, or physical or legal attacks against human rights defenders."
"We provide access to remediation and encourage our business partners to do the same, and recognize that this commitment should not obstruct access to other remedies."
Each of our i nternationally owned markets has HR staff that are responsible for handling concerns in an appropriate and timely manner.
"This process may include investigating complaints, interviewing witnesses, reviewing documentation and determining next steps."
"For ex ample, in the U."
"S. market, there are several reporting mechanisms available."
"Company -owned restaurant employees may report concerns or complaints to their restaurants General Manager or Ops consultant, HR Consulting or HR Manager, or the Business Integrit y Line."
We also provide Company -owned restaurant employees with third -party Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) such as the McResource Line and the Employee Resource Connection.
"These EAPs offer services such as counseling, referrals and other support, and are free and confidential."
"192 Additionally, in the U."
"S. market, the Company offers Franchisees a third -party managed hotline."

"Even where such fees or costs are legally permissible and within the legal limit, our policies and practices are designed to ensure that no one is indebted to the Company or to a recruiter, labor broker or employment agent in a manner that prohibits the individual from freely leaving his or her employment."
"Likewise, we do not retain employees original government -issued identification, passport or work permit as a condition of employment.1 The Company provides any agreements, whether oral or in writing, in a language understood by the person agreeing to be bound, and expects that any recruiter, labor broker or employment agent will do the same and will be responsible for ensuring that the agreement is understood by the person agreeing to be bound."

"With this in mind, we limit our use of such agreements as follows: We do not and will not, as a condition of employment, require mandatory arbitration of harassment and discrimination claims."
"While l eadership within the officer level, representing less than 10% of the employee population in 2019, sign noncompetition covenants, we do not require as a condition of employment any employee below the officer level to sign post - termination, noncompetition c ovenants, except in very limited situations as authorized by the General Counsel for an employee who has unique skills, knowledge or access to intellectual property, trade secrets or highly confidential customer information that would provide a competitor with an advantage (e.g., complex knowledge regarding menu innovation or critical technology applications or systems)."
