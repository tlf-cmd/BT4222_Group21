2021 ESG REPORT | 11Ethical and Safe Products Patients trust us to provide the medicines they need.
"They rely on us to provide products and services that are effective, ethical and safe."
That is why our unwavering commitment to product safety and quality is so essentialit is at the core of our work to bring forward medicines that transform patients lives.
"We are committed to delivering superior value and quality as we provide safe, ethical products and services that meet or exceed all regulatory requirements."
"Throughout our value chain, we take special care to ensure that we meet safety, efficacy, purity and quality standardsfrom design and development to manufacturing and distribution to proper methods of disposal."
"To deliver truly ethical products, it is imperative that we conduct our business in an environmentally sustainable manner."
"We take a precautionary approach when there is potential harm to human health or the environment, and we integrate principles of resource conservation, pollution prevention and environmental responsibility across our global operations."
"We also collaborate with the public, along with government, industry and educational organizations, to support regulations, research and programs that address environmental, health and safety concerns throughout our industry."
Regulations and standards Our sector is one of the most highly regulated industries because human health and lives are at stake.
"We comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the regulations for current Good Laboratory Practice, Good Manufacturing Practice, Good Clinical Practice, Pharmacovigilance and Good Distribution Practice."
"Product security From development to commercial manufacturing to distribution to disposal, we protect the entire product life cycle with a variety of controls and monitoring tools."
"We employ an integrated team to address counterfeiting, product tampering, theft and diversion issues, including through the following measures: Implementing security technologies that make our packaging and products less vulnerable to counterfeiting and secure their movement within the supply chain."
Participating in industry coalitions focused on product security.
Collaborating with our supply chain vendors and law enforcement agencies on product security matters.
Addressing counterfeit drugs: customer and partner communications SASB - HC-BP-260a.2 We take the risks related to counterfeit medicines very seriously and do all we can to build safety into our medicines and into the supply chain.
"We evaluate potential risks across the value chain and apply scientific and technical controls to try to reduce the ability to produce counterfeits, but also to enhance our ability to detect counterfeits."
"This requires that we work with multiple global authorities, including the U."
"S. Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection, to share information and collaborate on the detection and removal of counterfeits and unsafe medicines from the market."
We also have robust drug safety and surveillance programs and support global reporting of any suspected counterfeits.
Interwoven into the reporting or detection programs are time-bound processes that initiate product recall and subsequent testing as appropriate and in concert with the regulatory authorities.
2021 ESG REPORT | 12Single integrated quality management system Robust product and data |Culture of excellence | Urgency with rigor | Competitive compliance | Reliable supply |Operational excellence Digital qualityOrganization and culture Processes and proceduresPatients Quality management system Our quality management system (QMS) consists of a series of standards and business processes that ensure we ethically and rigorously achieve quality outcomes across the spectra of regulatory frameworks.
"It defines our ways of working; our strict specifications for product manufacturing, testing and packaging; and the controls we use to make sure we consistently achieve the quality outcomes we intend and expect."
"To further enhance our QMS, we are well into a multi-year journey to transform it across the product life cycle into a common GxP or good practiceframework."
"As we integrate our quality philosophy across the product life cycle, we are driving progress toward cloud-based quality applications."
These are the first steps in building a foundation for our predictive quality vision.
"In 2021, we continued to advance our QMS to meet or exceed the expectations of regulators in the development and life cycle management of combination products."
"This included implementing continuous improvement initiatives on essential QMS processes relevant to devices including Design Control and Post-Market Surveillance, which provide the foundation for our streamlined approach."
"Pharmaceutical companies are also regulated by health authorities worldwide, such as the U."
S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
"These health authorities audit our operations on a regular basis, and in 2021, we completed more than 100 regulatory inspections."
"Our QMS is designed to meet or exceed global, industry-recognized standards and guidelines to build a comprehensive quality framework that is agile enough to respond to change, and robust enough to advance novel and differentiating technologies inclusive of devices and combination products."
Product safety Providing safe products is a top priority at BMS.
"In this regard, one of the most important actions we take is to monitor and evaluate safety data associated with our marketed medicines and our investigational drugs in clinical trials."
"To ensure that we meet our worldwide safety reporting requirements, employees, consultants, and independent contractors must promptly report any potential or actual adverse events, as well as other events associated with our products when they become aware of them."
"These events include any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not the event is considered to be directly related to the medicinal product."
"We also embed technology and systems to identify and protect our brands from instances of counterfeiting, tampering, theft or diversion."
"In addition, employees are required to promptly report possible diversion instances by notifying Corporate Security and Quality and Compliance representatives and business unit senior management within 24 hours."
"2021 product safety highlights At BMS, we believe that one safety incident is one too many."
"In 2021, we continued to achieve exceptional product safety performance and results with zero incidents, maintaining the quality of our products for the patients who rely on them."

"In line with these regulations, all BMS medicines in serialized markets are now required to have a unique identifier in the packaging, which enables each saleable unit of a product to be tracked throughout the entire supply chain."
"During the serialization process, a unique 2D data matrix is placed on each carton of product."
"As the product moves through the supply chain, wholesalers, distributors and dispensers can scan this code to confirm that the product is legitimate."
"Serialization data is then exchanged between nodes in the supply chain, in accordance with market regulations."
"Combined with our experience exchanging data with internal and external partners, the ability to encode more information including unit-level identificationon our packaging offers valuable new capabilities for BMS."
"Nearly all our internal and external packaging lines are serialization capable, and moving forward, we expect to focus on improving supply chain visibility and enhancing customer experience."
"By 2023, the U."
S. is expected to have a system that will enable transactional data to be gathered across the supply chain for each unique identifier.
This will establish full end-to-end visibility if a suspect product is detected.
These capabilitiesoriginally developed to meet government regulations aimed at protecting patient safetymay be leveraged to enable a customer-specific experience and the delivery of patient-specific medicines.
"Takeback, reuse and product disposal SASB - HC-BP-250a.4 The Pharmaceutical Product Stewardship Work Group (PPSWG) manages the takeback of BMS medications from patients."
"The PPSWG coordinates these efforts through MED-Project , a stewardship organization that implements and operates mandated household unwanted medicine and sharps takeback programs."
"Due to regulations, pharmaceutical products are not sorted after collection, making it difficult for BMS to calculate the amount of unused BMS products collected from U."
S. patients.
"However, in 2021, we know that residents in California, Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington disposed of 357 tons of unwanted, household-generated materials collected through MED-Projects programs."
This included more than 93 tons of unused medicines that were disposed of via Med-Projects sharps programs and 264 tons that were disposed of via its unwanted medicine programs.
"In addition to our work with MED-Project, we collaborate with other organizations to facilitate takeback in our industry."
"Examples include the websites myoldmeds.com and medsdisposal.eu, which create an easy way for patients to identify a nearby location where they can properly dispose of unwanted, unused or expired household medicines."
The websites also highlight how important it is for patients to securely store household medicines and follow the labeling information and medication guides that companies provide.
"In 2021, there were >20 active unwanted medicine programs and nine sharps programs throughout the U."

"2021 ESG REPORT | 14 Ethical and Safe ProductsCybersecurity Our patients, partners, employees, suppliers and other third parties rely on us to securely store their information."
Maintaining their trust is fundamental to our values of accountability and integrity and critical to our business success.
Our cybersecurity and data privacy programs are aligned to the U.
S. National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and informed by and tailored to address a specific set of cyber risk scenarios relevant to BMS.
We leverage data analytics and artificial intelligence to help us identify and defend against cyber threats and to constantly learn how these threats evolve.
"We maintain strong industry relationships and collaborate to defend against cyber threats, including with our third-party providers and with government agencies, such as the U."
S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency.
"To further mitigate potential security and privacy risks related to cyber threats, we engage in real-time education of our global workforce."
"For example, in the U."
S. our employees receive a monthly snapshot of their cyber behaviors and are given an overall rating for their cyber vigilance.
"Following a gamification approach, we have seen measurable improvement in employees behaviors across scored areas and increased organic dialogue on cyber vigilance."
Cyber vigilance and preparedness The U.
"S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suggests that future credit ratings may consider cyber preparedness, in addition to the disclosure of cyber risks and incidents."
"Ratings agencies are still in the process of staffing cybersecurity experts to carry out this task, but they expect it to become a meaningful component of their credit ratings in the coming years."
Addressing emerging cybersecurity risks Geo-Political Risk Russias invasion of Ukraine has increased focus on geo-political threats and the response/continuity planning required.
Associated increases in sabotage and espionage have been observed across various industry sectors and companies with operations in the region and are expected to continue.
Our response: Bolstering defense measures against threat actors and tactics.
Transitioning commercial operations in Russia (including workforce) to third party.
Third-Party Supply Chain Risks Threat actors continue to target supply chains to compromise a greater number of victims and maximize harm.
Cloud providers are a likely target focus due to potential impact.
Our response: Continuing to evolve our third-party risk management program and conducting table-top exercises to identify gaps in and improve our supply chain resilience.
Human Risk Phishing attacks remain the most common cause of data breaches.
"Threat actors continue to expand tactics, employing SMS and Microsoft Teams-based attacks to avoid detection on corporate networks."
"Our response: Rolled out cybersecurity snapshots which provide a cyber vigilance score much like a credit report to our employees, based on various behavior categories (e.g., reporting phishing emails or visiting risky websites)."
"2021 ESG REPORT | 15In response, we are partnering with the Healthcare and Public Health Sector Coordinating Council Cybersecurity Working Group and the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center to determine any operational adjustments that may be required."
This work includes assessing the potential impact of the SECs new practices on our current SEC reporting requirements and exploring options for addressing existing gaps.
"Across industries, organizations struggle to deal with the human element of cybersecurity and adaptation of secure behaviors."
"To pinpoint human security risk, BMS has implemented a human risk management program across our global enterprise to translate our behaviors into personalized and aggregated scorecards."
"The scorecards, shown below, measure five cyber behaviors and enable analysis at the organizational, departmental and individual levels."
"The results are used by the BMS cybersecurity team to achieve a targeted change in behavior, and effectively communicate expectations to all employees through a targeted learning approach."

2021 ESG REPORT | 22 InnovationHealth Equity Health equity is a strategic priority for BMS.
"By applying a health equity lens to our work, we drive inclusive innovation, high-quality science and the expanded reach and impact of our medicines."
"As we integrate ESG into our strategy for growth, we consider an emphasis on health equity to be a business imperativenot only because it is central to our vision, but also because it is simply the right thing to do."
"As one of the worlds largest healthcare companies, we have a responsibility to address global health inequities."
"We aim to provide comprehensive, equitable care for our patients and communities by ensuring that everyoneregardless of their race, gender, socioeconomic status or geographyhas access to the medicines and care they need, notonly to survive but to thrive."
BMS has been on a health equity journey for many yearscontinuously building new tools and partnerships to tackle health inequities throughout the U.
S. and around the world.
"Our work to achieve health equity touches on a variety of overlapping issues, such as access gaps and health disparities; government policy; clinical trial and supplier diversity; and many more."
"Our National Health Equity Advisory Board advises our two-pillared health equity strategy, which drives us to further the inclusive discovery, development and delivery of innovative medicines and advance health equity solutions beyond the pill."
"Examples of beyond the pill solutions include improving the quality of care that patients receive and helping them navigate the healthcare landscape, particularly in specialty care settings, in a way that helps them best meet their needs."
"Health equity commitment BMS is deeply invested in programs to enhance health and social equity, both in our organization and in the communities where we live and work."
"In August of 2020, we launched our I&D and Health Equity Commitments , with a $150 million, five-year investment to help address disparities in healthcare, increase diversity in clinical trials, expand the supply chain to include more diverse suppliers, enhance our employees ability to give back to the community and increase the diversity of our own workforce."
"In 2021, we provided a total of $27.9 million for 107 health equity grants."
"The grants aimedto scale effective health equity solutions, including 24grants for proposals focused on community health workers and patient navigators."
"Together, the projects address BMStherapeutic areas of oncology, cardiovascular, hematology, immunology, fibrotic diseaseand neuroscience."
"Additionally, as part of our commitment to tackle health inequities in the U."
"S., we advocate to shape and inform effective health equity public policies."
"We have numerous programs and initiatives in place designed to listen and create spaces for patient advocates and community partners to come together, and to deliver inclusive, multilingual and culturally competent disease education and quality of care programs."
"In 2021, our grants resulted in: >619,000 people reached >4,000 people trained 530+ educational events and convenings 85 resources and platforms created to expand disease awareness and education We view our work through the lens of health equity We see health equity as a critical opportunity to modernize and deepen our patient-centered purpose."
"By applying a health equity lens across the product life cycle, we can accelerate inclusive innovation and expand the impact of our medicines to support medically underserved and diverse patient populations around the world."
2021 ESG REPORT | 23Clinical Trials Clinical trials and research are essential to our work of bringing innovative medicines to patients.
"They afford patients an opportunity for hope, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, geographical region, gender or race."
The data that we generate from clinical trials helps us answer important scientific questions and evaluate the efficacy and safety of various medicines and treatment options.
"While accounting for the complexity and length of clinical trials, we design and launch programs to determine product safety and efficacy and meet health authority expectations for new product or indication applications."
Diversity in clinical trials Diversity in clinical trials is a key driver of health equity.
Clinical trials present opportunities for patients to receive high-quality care while deepening clinicians understanding of the safety and efficacy of exploratory medicines for diverse populations.
"Under BMS Diversity in Clinical Trials Commitment, we established the goal to locate 25% of new clinical trials in racially and ethnically diverse areas in the U."
S.
Doing so will help us enroll clinical trial populations that are more reflective of broader patient populations and aligned with the epidemiology of the diseases we study.
BMS currently follows six formal Diversity in Clinical Trials workstreams: Protocol Design Patient Support Site and Investigator Support Internal and External Training Communication and Engagement Metrics and MeasurementsInnovating to advance clinical trials Our experience during the COVID-19 pandemic led us to enhance efficiencies in our clinical trials and offer new options that are more convenient for many participants.
"For instance, we began offering remote check-in for patients via telemedicine-streamlined trials and facilitating direct-to-patient shipping for some medications."
"These changes, while initially disruptive, are now helping us to accelerate our clinical trial diversity efforts."
"For example, with geography decreasing as a barrier, we are able to accept applicants from a broader patient base."
I&D are essential for better health outcomes for our patients.
"In 2021, 54% of our U."
"S. clinical trial sites were located in highly diverse communities, with a goal of making these trials more accessible, diverse and inclusive."
"2021 ESG REPORT | 24Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation* Diversity in Clinical Trials Award Program The Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation, an independent charitable entity, established a program to increase the participation of diverse and underserved patents in clinical trials in the United States."

>32K employees worldwide >12.2K members of our eight People and Business Resource Groups representing 44 countries 2021 ESG REPORT | 28Global Inclusion and Diversity We are guided by a single vision to transform patients lives through science.
"To fully realize this vision, we have relied on the strength of our rich history and longstanding commitment to inclusion and diversity to ensure that we can drive meaningful impact and outcomes for our patients and communities, our colleagues, and our business and industry."
Doing so helps us drive equitable advancements and outcomes for all.
Our evolved Global Inclusion & Diversity (GI&D) strategy and priorities are the first steps on the path forward to meaningful change.
"This strategy, along with workforce representation data, isdetailed in our Global Inclusion & Diversity Report ."
Workforce representation Harnessing the collective power of a globally diverse workforce requires transparency and accountability.
"Working from that premise, we leverage best practices in talent management, accelerated leadership development and inclusive leadership to create an environment where every individual with the skills our company requires can succeed."
Workforce aspirational representation goals We value an executive team that reflects the perspectives and backgrounds of the patients and communities we serve.
"In 2020, we made a series of commitments to advance I&D and health equityboth in our own business and in communities around the world."
Our stated aspirations were to achieve gender parity at the executive level globally; double executive representation of Black/African American employees in the U.
S.; and double executive representation of Hispanic/Latino employees in the U.
S. by 2022.
We have made progress toward each of these aspirational goals in 2021: 45.5% global executives were women in 2021 vs. 42.6% in 2020 4.5% of U.
S. executives were Black/African American in 2021 vs. 2.4% in 2020 7.2% of U.
"S. executives were Hispanic/Latino in 2021 vs. 4.2% in 2020Veteran, people with disabilities and LGBTQ+ status self-identification: Everybody Counts In the U."
"S. and Puerto Rico, employees can disclose their veteran status, disability status and LGBTQ+ status in our Human Resources system of record."
"Through Everybody Counts, an amplified self- identification program that includes leader messages and employee videos, we are seeing an increased number of employees who voluntarily participate in this disclosure."
"For example, from 2019 to 2021, the percentage of employees who disclosed their disability status grew from 36.7% to 44.4%an increase of 7.7%."
"In addition, the percentage of employees who disclosed their gender identification and sexual orientation status grew from 6.4% to 14.8%an increase of 8.4%."
These results indicate that we are creating an environment of trust and psychological safety where employees feel they can disclose the full spectrum of their identity at BMS.
Our People and Business Resource Groups BMS is committed to sustaining a culture of inclusion.
We know that our patient-focused mission and business objectives rely on bringing together and supporting diverse people with unique experiences and perspectives.
Our People and Business Resource Groups (PBRGs) help us meet this commitment in a way that directly impacts our business performance.
Each of our eight PBRGs is integrated into the business and led by a full-time business leader who reports directly to members of our Leadership Team.
"They serve as a trusted advisory group, providing critical support on key business initiatives while amplifying the voice of our workforce and fueling innovation through diverse insights andknowledge."
"Our PBRGs accelerate the development of many members, empowering them to become business leaders who add value by helping to execute BMS business plans."
PBRGs also offer opportunities to closely collaborate with our Diversity in Clinical Trials and Health Equity teams.
"In 2021, our PBRGswhich are open to our entire global workforcegrew to include more than 12,200 unique members serving across more than 200 chapters in 44 countries."
Nearly 40% of our employees worldwide are members of PBRGs.

"A participating organization since 2012, BMS supports OYW as an opportunity to provide leadership development and demonstrate our commitment to nurture and grow emerging leaders at the company."
Partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Preparing Black/African American students for success in STEM requires resources and guidance they may not have exposure to before college.
"The number of STEM graduates has grown, especially at the bachelors and masters levels."
"However, Black/African American and Latino/ Hispanic talent remain underrepresented in the STEM workforce compared with their share of all workers."
HBCUs help address this disparity as evidenced by the fact that 20% of the graduates from these institutions receive a STEM-related degree.

2021 ESG REPORT | 42Water and Wastewater Water is a precious resource that is necessary to produce effective and safe medicines for our patients.
"To this end, we look for ways to reduce our water consumption and find better mechanisms of watertreatment."
"Water conservation In 2021, BMS mobilized its sites to continue driving water efficiency to help achieve its water reduction goals."
"We focused on optimizing operational efficiency, deploying more efficient sequences of operation and implementing key capital upgrades."
"Despite the impacts of COVID-19, in 2021, we continued to find ways to drive efficiency through internally run virtual treasure hunt eventsefforts that led us to implement 24 energy and water reduction measures across the portfolio."
This included six key water-use optimization projects at five critical sites.
"Wastewater treatment To safeguard water, we follow stringent corporate standards and guidelines that meet or exceed local requirements regarding the treatment and management of wastewater effluents."
We design clean and efficient pharmaceutical manufacturing processes that do not have an adverse impact on the environment.
"Additionally, the wastewater from Bristol Myers Squibbs manufacturing facilities undergoes a high degree of treatment before being discharged to the environment."
"This treatment is provided by company-owned and operated on-site infrastructure or off-site municipal wastewater treatment systems, or a combination of both."
"Pharmaceuticals in the Environment(PiE) Pharmaceuticals have been found in the environment for decades, and with advancements in environmental detection techniques/ sensitivity and an increased frequency of monitoring campaigns, the number of pharmaceuticals identified has increased."
"While the primary source of pharmaceuticals reaching the environment is through human use and subsequent excretion into wastewater systems, the improper disposal of unused medicines and manufacturing effluent discharge can also serve as secondarysources."
"To help address this issue, BMS is involved with the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) in Europe, a public-private research partnership between the European Union and the European pharmaceutical industry."
"BMS is currently participating in the Prioritization and Risk Evaluation of Medicines in the EnviRonment(PREMIER) initiative, which seeks to foster greener pharmaceutical design processes in addition to improving the availability of environmental data for all stakeholders."
"At BMS, we strive to ensure that operations at our facilities are both environmentally responsible and protective of personal and public health and safety, starting by designing clean and efficient manufacturing processes, and routinely assessing existing facility operations."
"We establish safe discharge concentrations for our internal/external manufacturing processes that assess potential environmental impacts, and identify ways to minimize any potential environmental or human health impacts from discharge."
"BMS works with numerous suppliers and third-party manufacturers who share our commitment to responsible practices, including compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as our Standards of Business Conduct and Ethics for Third Parties (3PStandards)."
"Environmental fate/effects studies and Environmental Risk Assessments (ERAs) are conducted for all new medicines when applying for approval, in accordance with local regulations."
"We are committed to transparency in reporting the environmental data we collect, and have made information related to APIs available to the public through various partnership initiatives (e.g., iPiE*SUM, FASS database) and on our product Safety Data Sheets ."
"Additionally, shifts in our portfolio to certain biologics (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) have produced new medicines that more readily biodegrade in the environment, further reducing impacts related to PiE."
BMS is committed to continuous improvement in this space.
"In 2022, BMS plans to commence its ecopharmacovigilance program to monitor our products post-launch for environmental risks by tracking the scientific literature for emerging data on exposure and effects.2019-PRESENT, SUSTAINABILITY METRICS WATER 2019 (baseline)202119-21 % Change Revenue (million USD) 26,145146,385 77% Employees 30,000132,200 7% WATER USE (million liters) Total WaterUse Municipal, Groundwater, Surface3,054.0113,168.25 4%2 1 Includes Celgene results from November 20, 2019 through December 31, 2019."

2021 ESG REPORT | 44Packaging and Transportation Our commitment to sustainability does not end when our life-saving medicines have been developed and manufactured it continues throughout the distribution process to destinations around the world.
"BMS Distribution and Logistics teams, which are responsible for storing and distributing the companys products, continually seek opportunities to reduce waste, conserve energy and reduce carbonemissions."
BMS has fully outsourced our logistics operation and uses service providers for warehousing and transportation.
"As sustainability is embedded into our approach to supplier management, we actively review scoring of environmental responsibility criteria during the vendor selection process."
"Once selected, we work proactively with our partners to incorporate actions that improve the environmental footprint for transportation of our products."
"Whether ground, air or ocean, the mode of transport of our products plays a meaningful role in developing our transportation plans."
"Wherever it is feasible and makes sense, we move from air to ocean transport, which significantly cuts carbon emissions, and utilize vendors who provide more efficient ground transportation."
"Some are even beginning to offer electric fleet vehicles, like in Brazil where we have reduced by 93kg the CO 2 emissions during the first month ofimplementation."
All of our products are shipped in temperature-controlled containers.
Our biology-based therapies require cold-chain transport and must remain at a constant temperature (2-8 degrees C) from the time they leave the manufacturing facility to when they reach the patient.
Thats why we ship these almost exclusively in battery-operated refrigerated pallet-sized containers that are completely reusable.
"When we have smaller, parcel-sized shipments, we use passive refrigeration in insulated shipper boxes with gel-pack inserts."
"Currently, we use reusable parcel containers in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Canada and plan to expand their use in other markets where possible in coming months."
"Ultimately, bolstering our supply chains reliability, agility and sustainability is a priority for us, and we will continue to work with vendors who share our commitment to continuing to reduce our transportation-related environmental impacts."
"In 2022, we expect to continue our commitment to sustainability with further reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, such as with the transition from RKN active shipping containers to thermal blankets, potentially saving up to 25kg of CO 2e per insulated pallet, as well as landfill waste reductions.2021 Highlights Reduced CO 2 emissions by 33% with the implementation of new shipping containers in two key shipping lanes 100% reduction in Sulphur Oxide, 91% reduction in Nitrogen Oxide, and 29% reduction in Carbon Dioxide through the conversion of barges to ocean vessels powered by Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) between the U."
"S. & Puerto Rico Reduced CO 2 emissions by ~70% converting from air to ocean mode for vendor shipments to Puerto Rico 3 Ton carbon emissions reduction in Argentina due to alignment of product order size and shipping container capacity 2021 ESG REPORT | 45Responsible sourcing In support of our efforts to address Scope 3 emissions, our Strategic Sourcing and Procurement organization is committed to driving reductions in negative environmental impacts across our external value chain."
"This commitment is being led through our sustainable procurement strategy, in which sustainability is embedded as a value driver in supplier partnership and innovation."
One component of this strategy that we are developing is our Responsible Sourcing program.
"Through the program, we plan to work with supply chain partners to assess their current state of environmental responsibility, set goals and targets to drive progress toward continuous sustainable improvement, and mitigate risks across our supply chain while contributing to our global commitments to environmental responsibility."
"The Responsible Sourcing program is key to realizing BMS sustainability procurement strategy, which includes: Monitoring the supply chain sustainability risks and performance Addressing sustainability as a core area of performance in the SS&P/supplier partnership Implementing a core set of requirements to move suppliers through a journey of continuous improvement Increasing supplier due diligence to ensure that our suppliers are aligned with BMS in their values and ESG commitments Aligning to directly support BMS Third-Party Risk Management program, which identifies and reduces risks relating to the use of third parties BMS partners with EcoVadis to support the realization of the Responsible Sourcing program, which endeavors to realize the following benefits, outcomes and goals: Benefits Active engagement with suppliers to support their efforts to improve legal and regulatory compliance, brand reputation and stakeholder relations Support of our suppliers on their sustainability journey Building relationships with suppliers that have made ESG within their own operations a priorityExpected outcomes Increased awareness of supplier sustainability profiles Development of robust ESG capabilities and ways of working Increased transparency anddisclosure Drive performance improvementsProgram goals Embed ESG principles into and across BMS global sourcing and procurement strategy Implement requirements to level-set supplier performance and ensure strategic, values-based partnership 2021 ESG REPORT | 46 Packaging and TransportationSustainable Facility Design Managing our global facilities responsibly enables us to further reduce our environmental impact and ensure our buildings are inclusive for all."
"Accordingly, when we construct new facilities or retrofit old ones, we do so with a long-term view utilizing sustainable construction practices, incorporating state-of-the-art efficiencies and applying universal design principles."

"While we do not record the frequency of all such communications, several examples are detailed below: Internally : At Town Halls that occur several times a year, BMS Board Chair and CEO emphasizes the importance of integrity for all employees, and the company leadership team is encouraged to do the same in theircommunications."
"The Board Chair and CEO, and Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer (CCEO), communicate several times each year on integrity-related topics including company values, our Principles of Integrity, and anti-bribery policy training and compliance."
"The I in Integrity initiative has been rolled out across the company under the leadership of the CCEO, and has provided tools and resources to encourage and facilitate conversations related to integrity."
"The Reality Check series of articles, published monthly by the Compliance & Ethics department, based on real incidents, is intended to provide employees with a greater awareness of how to identify and escalate potential concerns."
"The Compliance & Ethics department, under the leadership of the CCEO, publishes regular companywide memos and articles on the internal news platform to support our commitment to ethics and integrity."
"Externally: The CEO highlights our commitment to integrity in the BMS annual report, as well as in the opening remarks and Q&A at our annual shareholder meeting In the 2021 proxy statement, integrity was highlighted as a measure of CEO performance, Board member selection criteria and employee compensation policies."

UN Global Compact.
Participant in the 2020 Norges Bank Investment Management and the Basel Institute on Governance working group to develop guidance for companies to report on the effectiveness of their anti-corruption compliance program.
This is BMS inaugural report in accordance with this guidance.
"2021 ESG REPORT | 72Indicator Indicator Description 2021 Response Risk Management 2.1The company has an anti-corruption compliance risk program, which it uses to give regular updates to senior management and Board on how risks are being managedBMS anti-corruption compliance program is a cross-functional effort, including first-, second- and third-line risk management functions."
First-line business owners establish systems and processes with anti-corruption controls; second-line functions such as Compliance and the Controller monitor relevant activities for anti- corruption compliance; and the independent internal audit function reviews first- and second-line activities.
"Results of risk assessments, monitoring and auditing by these functions are shared with the BMS leadership team, other business unit leaders, the Board of Directors and its Audit Committee regularly."
2.2The percentage of business functions that are included in the anti-corruption risk assessment100% of business functions are represented in BMS anti-corruption risk assessments.
2.3The company has established anti-corruption compliance KPIs that are used to measure the compliance programSeveral risk management functions capture and track metrics related to anti-corruption compliance.
"Examples include results of risk assessment and related mitigation activities, number and types of exceptions based on 100% review of expenditures and SOX control deficiencies."
"Third Parties 3.1Percentage of third-party reviewsconductedThird-party reviews span the life cycle of a relationship, are coordinated among the second- and third-line functions, and are based on risk."
"Specifically: 100% of high-risk third parties from an anti-corruption perspective (as determined based on several factors, including their services, location, and prior experience with BMS) are subject to due diligence at the time of selection or contract renewal, with a reassessment at regular intervals thereafter."
"Additional deep-dive ongoing monitoring reviews, which include site visits and transaction testing, are also conducted on certain third parties based on risk."
Internal audit scopes select third parties into their annual plan based on their risk assessment.
3.2How the findings from third-party reviews are addressedSecond-line risk management and the internal audit functions liaise with the relevant BMS business owner to share findings and expectations with third parties.
"Compliance standards are memorialized in third-party agreements, and BMS provides additional support where needed, such as anti-bribery training, to third parties."
"3.3Percentage of third parties that improve their anti-corruption compliance programsA vast majority (>95%) of third parties improve their anti-corruption programs in response to our findings, and doing so is a critical factor for BMS to continue its relationship with a third party."
"Results of due diligence, ongoing monitoring and internal audits are shared with third parties and tracked regularly for on-time completion."
"2021 ESG REPORT | 73 NBIM Index 2021Indicator Indicator Description 2021 Response Compliance 4.1The organizational structure of the company is transparent, including the location of the compliance function within the structure, and it identifies where the Chief Compliance Officer is situatedOur CCEO is part of the company leadership team and reports to the General Counsel, with accountability to the CEO and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors."
Our CCEOs role on the company leadership team is detailed on the companys external website and annual reports.
4.2The governance structure of the company enables the Chief Compliance Officer to execute her/his responsibilities impartiallyThe CCEOs direct and private access to the CEO and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis enables the CCEO to act independently.
"4.3Ethics and integrity are integral components in all talent and leadership development programsAll our Growth & Development programs are anchored to, and aligned with, the six BMS Values, one of which is Integrity."
"Our leadership development programs are designed around our Values, which inform expected leadership capabilities."
"Nominations for these programs are based on consistent high performance, which includes demonstrating our Values as well as achieving our companywide objectives, which requires Demonstrating ethics, integrity and quality in everything we do."
4.4The program is adequately resourced and empowered to function effectivelyBMS Compliance & Ethics organization and its relevant partners are fully resourced to deliver on our anti- corruption compliance program priorities.
Budget is evaluated several times a year and adjusted as needed.
The CCEOs independent role (access to CEO and Board) empowers the program to function effectively.
BMS has also been awarded the Compliance Leader Verification seal by the Ethisphere Institute since 2012; results of this independent assessment indicate a strong and continuously improving compliance program.
"4.5The frequency of the Board actively reviewing the sufficiency of resources allocated to the global anti-corruption and briberyprogram including the compliancefunctionOur CCEO presents to, and has private sessions with, the Audit Committee several times a year."
The CCEO also presents annually to the full Board of Directors.
"While resourcing is not an explicit agenda item in every meeting, these meetings provide the opportunity to address resource topics."
"Oversight 5.1Access by the Chief Compliance Officer to the Board, including the Board committees (i.e., the supervisory level of the company) on a formalized basis and the actual frequency of that accessOur CCEO is present at every Audit Committee meeting and presents at several."

"In 2021, the CCEO attended all eight Audit Committee meetings, presented at three of these meetings and had four private sessions with the Audit Committee."
