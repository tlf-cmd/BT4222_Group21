"The strategy is built on four pillars: Inclusion, Employee Development, Communities and Supplier Diversity."
"The role of the CDO is to support the advancement of inclusion at Costco, the growth of a diverse employee base, our relationships in the communities where we do business, and an increase in our base of diverse suppliers."
Conversation Starters.

"This helps us in the long run by minimizing turnover and enhancing employee productivity, commitment and loyalty."
We encourage our employees to view Costco as a place for a long-term career rather than just a job.

Our worldwide policies and practices are designed to mirror our practices in the U.
"S., subject to local regulations, customs and market conditions."
"For salaried management in our locations, as well as positions in the corporate and regional oces, we also seek to provide competitive compensation and benets."
"Although many salaried employees might nd higher compensation or better perks at other companies, our retention rates, particularly for longer-term Costco employees, are very strong."
"We believe our competitive compensation and benets, opportunities for growth and advancement, and the stability and culture of the company drive our strong retention rates."

"Worldwide, we have over 13,500 employees who have more than 25 years of Costco service."
We feel the experience level and loyalty of our employees is a great asset for us.
A related advantage comes from our philosophy and practice of promoting from within our employee ranks.
We are proud of the fact that the vast majority of our warehouse managers worldwide began their Costco careers in hourly positions.
"In addition, a majority of our corporate and regional oce employees started in our warehouses, depots and business centers."

"Human Rights Costco is committed to respecting and protecting the human rights, safety and dignity of the people who contribut e to the success of our business."
"IntroductionAs a retailer with operations, logistics and merchandise supply chains spanning the globe, we recognize the impact we can have on the human rights of individuals directly and indirectly related to our business."
"Our human rights procedures, goals and programs pertain to our employees and to the people in the supply chains that produce goods for Costco."
"We have adopted policies and procedures around key human rights topics that are guided by our Code of Ethics , important to all levels of our organization, and aligned with such international instruments as the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Business and Human Rights ; the International Bill of Human Rights ; and the International Labour Organizations Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work ."
Our employee-related rights are overseen and managed by senior management for each business unit.
"(F or details, see the Employee Development page in our People & Communities section )."
"Supply-chain programs are overseen by the head of Global Sustainability & Compliance, who reports directly to the CEO and regularly engages the executive team and the Board of Directors on our human rights due-diligence eorts."
"To further our commitment in this critical area, we commissioned an independent gap analysis, comparing our policies and eorts with the UNGPs."
We will use this analysis to improve our human rights program and further our alignment with the UNGPs.
"1 $75M 2,000 $74.8M $11M Our EmployeesSince its inception in 1983, Costco has conducted business under the following Code of Ethics: Obey the Law Take care of our members Take care of our employees Respect our suppliers Reward our shareholders Our Code of Ethics is found in the companys handbook, called the Employee Agreement, which outlines the specic policies to ensure a safe, productive and respectful work environment for everyone."
We conduct a survey of all U.
S. employees every three years to assess the eectiveness of our eorts and to revise and update the Employee Agreement.
The Employee Agreement is provided to all employees and is available on demand in hard copy and electronically on the companys Intranet site.
An additional way we assess the impact of our policies and workplace environment is by conducting our global employee engagement surveys.
We have experienced a signicant participation rate of 75% or higher and a high favorability rate (about 80%) overall.
The results show that Costco employees feel a strong sense of belonging.
"Further, the survey helps us gauge how well our Open Door policy is working (for details, see the Employee Development page in our People & Communities section )."
We have consistently found that a vast majority of employees know how to access the various Open Door channels available if they have a workplace concern and feel equally comfortable doing so.
"As a way to track our performance and stay united in our mission, e xecutives from across the globe meet at Costcos headquarters every period (approximately 30 days) to report on the health of the business and discuss, among other things, events that may have an impact on employees and our related response."
At the core of Costcos philosophy is our intention to do the right thing.
This principle is taught and encouraged at all levels of the company.
"2 $75M 2,000 $74.8M $11M Our Supply ChainIn recognition of the importance of respecting human rights in our supply chain, we adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct (the Code)."
"The Code is global and applies to all suppliers and their facilities, as well as to Costco-owned manufacturing facilities."
"To align with international standards, the Code is derived from the policies, standards and conventions of the United Nations and the International Labour Organization, as well as other leading independent standards, such as the Responsible Business Alliance and Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP)."
"Where any applicable laws and regulations are absent, or exceeded by the Code, Costco expects its suppliers to uphold the higher standard."
"In general, suppliers are contractually required to follow the Code."
The Code and our Code of E thics are routinely highlighted at events for both employees and suppliers to clearly communicate Costcos commitments to human rights.
"Our Supplier Code of Conduct The Code was established to protect the human rights and safety of the people who produce, process, harvest and transport the products we sell, while recognizing and respecting cultural and legal dierences found worldwide."
"To this end, Costco: Prohibits slave labor, human tracking, illegal child labor, illegal prison labor, abuse, harassment, bribery or attempted bribery, and health and safety conditions posing immediate risk to life and limb."
"Expects our suppliers to comply, at a minimum, with the applicable labor and environmental laws and regulations of the country where the merchandise is produced."
Encourages our suppliers to work to achieve what we call Above and Beyond Goals.
"While we have allowed suppliers to use legal prison labor to support rehabilitation and restitution, under specic conditions that are outlined in our Global Policy on Prison Labor , we continue to transition away from our limited use, as set forth in our 2022 Statement on Prison Labor ."
"Stakeholder Engagement & Supply Chain Risk Assessment Given the number of suppliers Costco has and their geographic dispersion, it is necessary to be strategic and selective with our eorts to mitigate human rights risks while supporting those most vulnerable in our supply chains."
"3 This risk-based approach is leveraged, in part, by internal expertise from our buying/sourcing, sustainability and compliance teams, as well as by frequent consultation with various external stakeholders who have signicant experience on the ground in supply chains."
"Additionally, we consider prior audit performance and data analytics from a third-party platform that analyzes political, human rights, economic and environmental risk indices."
"This work has helped us to identify risks and to build programs and initiatives (varying by industry and geography) to support the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, mitigate the risks of child and forced labor, and strengthen our broader sustainability eorts."
Examples of these programs are described below under Priority Industries for Strategic Collaboration.
"Likewise, this risk assessment process informs our approach to tar geting audits of supplier facilities against the Code standards."
We emphasize auditing suppliers of Kirkland Signature merchandise and suppliers whose product or country of origin poses an increased risk.
We continue to expand the scope of our audits to increase on-farm audits for produce and fabric mill audits for Kirkland Signature apparel and domestics.
4 Verication of Compliance Overview.
"In scal year (FY) 2022, 5,305 independent third-party audits were conducted in 87 countries, primarily at the nal manufacturer or processor level of the supply chain."
"For facilities considered intermediate to high risk, audits are required annually at a minimum, and more frequently if corrective actions to the Code violations require on-site verication."
"For suppliers who are in full compliance with the Code, subsequent audits may be less frequent."
"Of the 5,305 independent third-party audits conducted, 3,964 were conducted against the Codes standards."
"For facilities considered intermediate to high risk, these audits were carried out on a partially announced basis, providing the facility with a two-week window of when the audit would take place."
This limited advanced notice is provided in order to take the facilitys security measures into consideration and to allow the supplier to collect records that are reviewed during the audit.
"Fully unannounced audits are carried out on occasion, typically in response to tips received by our condential ethics hotline (explained below)."
"Audits include both the workplace where production takes place, as well as any on-site worker housing."
5 Many of our suppliers have existing programs to verify compliance with their own codes of conduct or with independent compliance audit standards.
"Upon review of the program and standards applied, Costco may accept these reports in lieu of audits against the Code."
"These audits make up the remaining 1,341 reports accepted in FY22."
"Acceptance depends on a variety of factors, such as industry and geographic risks for human rights violations and prior audit history."
"With very few exceptions that require Costcos review and approval, all audits ar e required to be conducted by a member of the Association of Professional Social Compliance Auditors (ASPCA)."
"As an industry association whose members represent a substantial majority of the Social Compliance audit industry, APSCA exists to enhance the professionalism, consistency and credibility of the individuals and organizations performing independent social compliance audits."

"Depending on the severity or lack of remediation of any Code violations, we reserve the right to t erminate our relationship or purchase orders with a supplier and its facility and have done so."
"Ultimately, however, Costco is committed to and prefers working with suppliers and their facilities that remediate Code violations, rather than applying sanctions that may cause further hardship to workers and their families."
7 Remediation .
"Here are a variety of ways we support suppliers, facilities and workers in our supply chain to remediate any human rights concerns raised through audits or other means: Corrective Action Plans (CAP) ."
We recognize there is room for continuous improvement and that some suppliers will need assistance with compliance.
"For any supplier with an audit that reveals the need for improvement, Costco requires a CAP that includes a time frame for correcting each violation and often on-site re-audits to verify progress."
Costco also oers capacity-building services that improve management systems to address the causes of previous violations of the Code and ultimately support the suppliers CAP completion.
eLearning Lessons .
"Starting in FY22, Costco partnered with Elevate to oer eLearning video lessons."
"These web-based lessons (often in the local language) are designed to educate suppliers and their facilities on human rights-related topics and provide guidance on correcting critical, low performance and intermediate violations."
The lessons give Costco suppliers tools to continuously improve.
"In FY22, 7,518 lessons were completed by suppliers and/or their facilities."
"The most frequently used lessons cover the categories of Fire Safety, Working Hours and Health & Safety."
"Initial ndings indicate that these lessons have been helpful and upon re-audit, many suppliers/facilities improved their audit scores."
Condential Ethics Hotline .
"We have a global condential ethics hotline to promote and monitor compliance with our Code of Ethics, our Supplier Code of Conduct, and other legal and ethical policies: www.costco.ethicspoint.com ."
"When we receive inquiries, we investigate appropriately."
"Depending upon the issue, we may work with suppliers directly or conduct independent third-party audits, and we may terminate our relationship with suppliers if appropriate remedial action is not taken."
"To make sure our suppliers know of all these eorts, we shared the above aggr egate audit results and other updates related to the Code at our annual Supplier Day event in the fall of 2022."
8 COVID-19 .
We continue to seek to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on workers in our supply chains.
"Where circumstances have restricted the ability to conduct independent on-site audits, we oer suppliers a self-assessment (including a remote, independent review of supporting documentation) and worker survey."
This is to further the safety and security of our suppliers workers and that of the auditors.
Employee Engagement .
"W e focus on educating our employees with buying responsibilities on the importance of the Code and their role in supporting it, through updated virtual training and in-person presentations, which review its requirements."
"Our Work with WRAP In FY22, Costco employees responsible for the day-to-day management of the Code s facility audits underwent a two-day training conducted by WRAP sta members."
"In addition to covering WRAP's 12 Principles , the training oered examples of practical challenges faced by auditors, as well as raised employees awareness of the following: ILO Forced Labor indicators; the UNGPs on Business and Human Rights; the 17 UNs Sustainable Development Goals; and various due-diligence laws and regulations from around the world."
Modern SlaveryWe recognize that forced labor and human tracking is a serious global problem and are taking steps to bring awareness and improvement to the issue.
"A leading cause of modern slavery is the unethical recruitment of workers, which often involves exorbitant fees paid by workers to labor recruiters, the retention of passports or other personal documents, and labor contracts in a language not understood by the worker."
We continue to actively address this through the following eorts and organizations: 9 Seafood Task Force (STF) .
"Costco helped establish and is an active member of the STF, a collaboration tackling human rights and environmental issues in the seafood industry."
We support the Responsible Recruitment Oversight working subgroup of the STF to advance the industrys eorts for responsible labor recruitment.
The primary goal is to leverage the power of the STFs membership to build demand for responsible recruitment practices throughout member supply chains.
"Learn more about the STFs work on Responsible Recruitment, as well as the Guidance on Responsibility for Recruitment Related Costs; the latter of which is intended to guide the implementation of the STF Code of Conduct standard on recruitment and hiring-related costs."
CIER TO .
"Costco and some of its fresh produce suppliers partner with CIERTO, an independent third-party nonprot that provides transparent, no worker-fee recruitment for farm workers in order to ethically and legally recruit farm labor for U."
S. agricultural products.
Labor Mobility P artnerships (LaMP) .
"Costco has partnered with LaMP to develop educational materials on compliant international labor sourcing, with a particular focus on the H-2A visa program in the U."
S.
These materials have been developed in collaboration with select Costco buyers of fresh produce and have been shared with the remainder of the U.
S. fresh produce buying sta responsible for managing supplier relationships.
This material helps to raise awareness of prominent forced labor and modern slavery risks and prepare the buying sta to address this topic in discussions and eld visits with their suppliers.
Responsible Labor Initiative (RLI) .
"Costco is a member of the RLI, which pr omotes the rights of workers vulnerable to forced labor globally."
This initiative represents another opportunity for Costco to join a diverse network of stakeholders focused on combating forced labor in our supply chains.
"Through our work with the RLI, we will continue to focus on leveraging industry-based eorts to reduce forced labor."
Other F ocus Areas.
"We also understand that sex tracking (including the commercial exploitation of children), occurs in the hospitality industry."
We work with Costco Travel suppliers to bring awareness to this issue.
"We also work with Truckers Against Tracking to educate our eet drivers, as well as other trucking service suppliers."
"10 Here are links to our Modern Slavery statements: Australia Modern Slavery Act Statement C alifornia Transparency in Supply Chain Act Disclosure UK Modern Slavery Act Statement Conict MineralsIn response to human rights abuses associated with mining, Costco adopted a Conict Minerals Policy Statement ."
More information can be found in our Form SD and Conict Minerals Report .
"In addition to our eorts to address minerals under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, commonly called 3TG and used in a wide variety of products), as of FY21 we added cobalt as a mineral of focus due to reported concerns over social and environmental impacts of cobalt extraction in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)."
"Additionally, beginning in FY22, our compliance program broadened the conict areas of concern beyond the DRC and adjoining countries to include all Conict Aected and High-Risk Areas as dened by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development."
Gold Jewelry Traceability Costco has a pr ogram with our U.
"S. gold jewelry suppliers to map the supply chain and promote compliance with these sourcing standards: RJC Chain of Custody, RMI or LBMA."
We have developed a third-party chain of custody review to support verication of the data identifying supply chain links back to the smelter/renery level.
"11 Responsible Minerals Initiative Costco is a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which helps companies address responsible sourcing of minerals used in many consumer products."
"We use the RMIs Conict Minerals Reporting Template and Cobalt Reporting Template to trace the supply chain, and the RMIs Responsible Minerals Assurance Process and database to monitor smelters and reners in our supply chain that are likely to supply minerals of 3TG and cobalt."
"Costco also leverages its membership in RMI to learn about emerging issues and best practices on responsible mineral sourcing, and to work on addressing shared challenges."
"Priority Industries for Strategic CollaborationCostco recognizes that collaboration with multi-stakeholder coalitions is key to addressing many of the issues we face, as social compliance audits alone will not fully address the complex issues of human rights in global supply chains."
"Therefore, we have established or joined multiple eorts to help improve the working conditions of people within our supply chains."
"Some examples include: Seafood As noted above, Costco is an active member of the Seafood Task Force (STF)."
"The STF is addressing human rights and environmental issues in the Thai shrimp and canned tuna supply chains, as well as the global tuna supply chain with a current focus on Taiwan."
"The STF includes representatives from Thai shrimp feed manufacturers, shrimp and tuna processors, tuna brands and trading companies, certain major retailers in the U."
"S. and Europe, and nongovernmental organizations."
"12 The STF continues to work with its members land-based and sea-based to implement its Monitoring and Evaluation Model that focuses on traceability, accountability and verication to demonstrate that farmed shrimp, marine ingredients (for shrimp feed) and wild caught tuna supply chains are traceable and internally assessed for supply chain risk."
"The STFs website explains how the organization is working to drive accountability, eliminate forced labor, increase transparency and build condence in seafood supply chains."
"Cocoa The majority of Kirkland Signatur e chocolate products are made from cocoa sourced through sustainable programs, some of which are from Costcos Sassandra Cocoa program, which involves cocoa from Cote dIvoire."
"Unfortunately, child labor is a long-term systemic issue in cocoa supply chains and requires a multi-faceted approach focusing on continuous improvement and broadening awareness."
We have had child labor monitoring and remediation programs in place for several years.
"When cases of child labor are identied, our partners begin to work on implementing a remediation plan for that family."
They also conduct follow-up visits to ensure the remediation plan is eective.
Examples of our remediations include: Increasing access to quality education through building classrooms.
"Facilitating the issuance of birth certicates, which allow children to attend school."
Providing school kits often needed for classwork.
"Building awareness in the community of the dangers to children including, but not limited to, carrying heavy loads, using machetes and exposure to pesticides."
Supporting women through various programs to provide them with skills and resources that help them support and champion their families welfare and education.
"For more details on cocoa sourcing, see the Cocoa & Coee page in our Merchandising section ."
"13 Agricultural Produce The following pages show collaborative eorts were involved in regarding produce: Equitable Food Initiative (EFI) Costco is part of a fresh produce multi-stakeholder eort that includes farmers, suppliers, buyers and NGOs t o improve labor practices, environmental stewardship and food safety for the benet of workers, agricultural communities, businesses and consumers."
"Costco has been the largest single investor/donor to EFIs development, with over $2.5 million contributed since 2018."
"Costco pays a premium for EFI-certied produce, to directly compensate farmworkers for the extra eort they provide in meeting EFIs rigorous standards."
"Costco is the largest payer of the EFI premiums, 87% of which go directly to farm worker bonuses."
"Since 2014, Costco has paid $15.9 million in premiums that have funded almost $14 million in worker bonuses."
"Ten percent of this premium is paid to EFI as a licensing fee for use of the Responsibly Grown, Farmworker Assured label."
"Licensing fees fund EFIs marketing eorts to build grower, buyer and consumer awareness of the program."
EFI provides: Workers and managers with training on conict-resolution and problem-solving strategies to promote continuous improvement and to comply with rigorous standards.
Workers with training on pesticide safety and personal protective equipment free of charge.

"This mission is captured by the Ethical Charter, of which Costco is one of many endorsers representing the fresh produce industry, including growers, labor agencies, packers, distributors, foodservice operators, marketers and retailers."
"In FY20, Costco and others worked to develop a pilot aimed at educating and building the capacity of select produce suppliers to strengthen their alignment with the Ethical Charter."
The pilot concluded in May 2021 and key ndings showed the eectiveness of providing virtual training and advisory services focused on building management systems.
Growers also validated the use of self-assessment questionnaires to measure compliance with the Ethical Charter.
We will continue to work with various industry stakeholders to take the learnings from the pilot program and further develop scalable solutions for the fresh produce industry.
"Apparel from Bangladesh With the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety having ceased operations as originally planned following its ve-year commitment, several former Alliance members and other brands have remained committed to sustaining the culture of factory safety in Bangladesh by launching Nirapon , a U."
"S.-based organization tasked with monitoring the ongoing safety, training and helpline eorts of the factories from which Nirapon members source."
"Costco supports these eorts by requiring suppliers who source from Bangladesh to either be active members of Nirapon or to support comparable eorts in place at the factory, thereby continuing the work of addressing building safety in the apparel industry of Bangladesh."
Cotton The sourcing of cotton presents particular challenges with respect to forced labor around the world.
"With that in mind, Costco has joined a F orced Labor Working Group , which consists of brands and trade associations, to share best practices and innovative approaches to mitigate forced labor risks, with a specic focus on apparel and home textile supply chains."
"Additionally, in 2020, we began a cotton supply-chain mapping program, which requires document verication, to further understand where the cotton in our apparel products originates."
The program covers Kirkland Signature apparel and home textile products.
Various screening processes are also applied to the manufacturing entities involved in these supply chains to promote compliance with trade-sanction laws.
"Most recently, as of FY22, the due diligence steps above have been supplemented by select product testing by Oritain, which uses forensic testing to verify the origin of the cotton."
"16 Updated Dec 2022Costco is aware of its responsibility to design and construct its sites and buildings in an energy-ecient, sustainable and environmentally responsible manner."
"Construction, Landscaping, & Preservation Sustainable P rinciples & DesignWith nearly 850 Costco war ehouses built around the world, we have learned smar t appr oaches to the design and construction process and are always learning more."
"Our warehouse designs are generally consistent with the requirements of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), an internationally accepted benchmark for green building design and construction."
Technological advancements and improved building materials have helped in this area.
"For example, thanks to engineering and design improvements, we can use less materials, such as columns and roof joists, while providing more strength."
And our preferred full metal buildings use the maximum amount of recycled material and reduce construction and maintenance costs.
This sustainable approach extends to the surrounding environment and ecosystem.
"As we plan new buildings, we are mindful of wetlands and habitats, and preserve natural wonders in designing our landscaping."
"We aim to provide larger trees, greater planting density, drought-tolerant species, native and ornamental vegetation in lieu of manicured lawns in the landscapes surrounding our buildings."
Read below to learn more about the steps we take to consider sustainability as we expand our network of Costcos around the world.
"1 Adaptive Reuse & Historic Preservation In some cases, we have been able to use an existing building for a new Costco."
"Besides minimizing the environmental impact, this adaptive reuse in some cases supports historic preservations."
"Examples include: In Thornclie Park, Ontario, Canada , our warehouse located in suburban Toronto is part of a building built in 1964, designated as a heritage site and considered one of the last remaining examples of mid-20th century modernist commercial architecture in the region."
Costco architects were able to save the historic facade through incorporating the warehouse entry and food court in the warehouse setting.
"In Stevenage, England , we adapted a building originally built in 1963 in consultation with Felix Candela, the Spanish Mexican architect."
"Besides helping to preserve a historically and architecturally important structure, we were able to use less new building material."
"Recycled MaterialsIn building our new warehouses, we choose materials with a high percentage of recycled content to reduce the use of virgin resources."
Examples include: New U.
"S., Canada, Mexico, and some international locations in Spain, Taiwan and Australia use prefabricated structural steel systems that are made with recycled content and can eventually be recycled again."
"Metal building insulation uses ECOSE Technology, which contains an average of 61% recycled content."
"We use recycled asphalt in new parking lots, with recycled concrete base material, if available."
"2 Other Sustainable Features When we can, we tak e other steps to reduce the use of resources and to save money ."
"These include: Roofs maintain a reectance rating of .67, emittance of .85 and SRI of 81, lessening the heat gain on the r oof."
"The erection eciency of the structural system (columns, beams, trusses and bracing) and envelope (metal roof and siding) reduce the overall construction duration, saving time and money."
High-eciency restroom xtures save 32% more water.
Mechanical heat from refrigeration systems is captured t o preheat hot water tanks.
"Santa Fe, Mexico City Costco worked with local entities to integrate a new warehouse within a park called Parque La Mexicana."
This project started with clearing land that had historically been used as a municipal waste landll.
"The new warehouse has a landscaped green roof, featuring a variety of drought-tolerant and low-water-use succulents, pre-built hives for pollinators, and an elaborate watering system using recycled water for landscape irrigation and toilets throughout the project."
"On top of the adjacent parking garage is a soccer eld, skate park and basketball and sports courts."
A local park association will operate the sports facilities.
"In Villebon, France , we incorporated additional sustainability features that include: Increased landscaping areas."
Two green walls (pictured on next page).
Recovery of rainwater for watering and water retention system.
Optimization of natural lighting to minimize consumption linked to articial lighting.
Implementation of water and energy meters for each type of use in order to monitor and optimize consumption together with sanitary ttings to reduce water consumption.
Ten electric charging stations available for members to recharge their vehicles.
"3 Creative Landscaping StepsCostco experiments with vegetation removal using goats, with pr ograms in Oregon, Texas and Washington."
These programs can save us money in landscaping costs and eliminate the use of herbicides to kill unwanted and invasive vegetation.
We continue to look for opportunities to expand this program where it makes sense.
Natural Preservation Natural preservation of natural wonders or indigenous lands is also important to Costco and our landscaping designs try to take this into account.
"The SW Calgary, Alberta, Canada warehouse is located on the lands of Tsuu TIna First Nations People in a commercial development reserve named Taza."
"Together Costco and the Tsuu TIna worked on blending the building into its environment, using only native plant and tree species in its landscaping to reect the heritage of the plains."
"The Merida, Mexico location has a cenot e (a natural sinkhole lled with groundwater) onsite that was restored and rehabilitated."
"It is named Kakutzal, a Mayan word meaning back to life or rebirth."
Onlookers can view the beauty of the natural feature from above on an interpretive plaza incorporated into the design.
4 Updated Dec 2022Transportation & Logistics Costcos core objectives include optimizing and streamlining our ordering and distribution syst ems.
"We aim to reduce our carbon emissions by seeking ocean, rail and road transportation eciencies."
We also strive to improve delivery eet eciencies and we support our employees eorts to reduce their transportation energy consumption.
Depot Distribution Cent ers Costcos depots (distribution centers) help reduce delivery costs by utilizing cross-dock systems for handling full pallets of merchandise from suppliers to warehouses (selling locations).
Costco continually evaluates its processes to improve shipping eciencies.
"These include optimizing packaging design and pallet conguration resulting in more products on a pallet, while striving to reduce packaging, protect goods and reduce delivery trucks on the road."
"Also, our plastic pallet initiative will reduce the pallet weight of each truckload by up to 1,500 pounds lighter loads are more ecient."
"Another way Costco reduces costs is by analyzing state weight and length oversize permits, and by using specialized equipment where geographically possible to handle heavier loads."
Costco also employs longer combination vehicles to maximize trailer utilization.
"In 2021, we began an electric tractor pilot to determine its eciency when evaluating maintenance, loadable weights, routes and the length of hauls between charging."
We also started testing electric terminal tractors and are receiving good feedback from our drivers.
"Based on that success, we plan to deploy our rst electric tractors in late 2022 and early 2023."
"Also, were pursuing ways to use 100% renewable energy to charge these electric vehicles, starting with one distribution facility and expanding to others over the next few years."
"1 Reverse LogisticsThe transportation team always looks for ways to reduce empty miles involving trucks returning to the depots from the warehouses (known as reverse logistics) to improve eciencies, save costs and take more trucks o the road, which reduces carbon emissions."
Examples include: Picking up truckloads of merchandise that are destined for a Costco depot for distribution to a regional group of warehouses.
"L oading trailers with returned goods that are headed to salvagers or need to be returned to the supplier , and consolidating those shipments into truckloads."
Growing the World Vision program to donate many of these goods to communities in need worldwide.
See the Minimizing Wast e page in our Operations section for details.
"L oading the trailers with recyclable materials to be consolidated and resold, such as corrugated cardboard, LDPE stretch wrap, metal and plastics."
"In addition, these streamlined reverse logistics programs help us to reduce our mer chandise handling costs and/or help fr ee up sales oor space in the warehouses."
"Creative Solutions: A Japan C ase Study As shown through our reverse logistics practices and our fulllment centers, we are always looking for ways to take trucks o the roads."
"For example, in Japan, we adopted a program to change how we ship goods from our Ichihara depot to our Tomiya warehouse, 270 miles away."
"Previously, an average of ve containers were hauled by trailer to the warehouse every day."
"In our new system, we reduced the shipments to two containers a week by train, reducing freight costs and trac on the road."
2 Fulllment CentersSome of Costcos distribution centers in the U.
S. and Canada also serve as fulllment centers for our Ecommerce business.
"The str at egic locations and procedures implemented provide us with business eciencies that reduce expenses, our shipping footprint, carbon emissions and packaging."
"Costcos Business Delivery eet continues to expand an internal initiative called Truck of the Future, which is aimed at maximizing eciency in our growing delivery eets."
"In 2018, we successfully eld-tested a customized vehicle with P ensk e Truck Leasing that improves the payload capacity by reducing body weight."
"This test found that the lighter truck increased the miles per gallon, lowering our fuel costs and carbon footprint."
We are now choosing these new vehicles as we add and renew eet leases.
Additional eciency features and pilot programs include:Business Delivery Fleet Using solar power t o replace batteries.
Using half pallets that are lighter and more ecient for delivery to small businesses.
Implementing new coolers that reduce the amount of dry ice by r eplacing them with gel packs.
"Overall, dry ice reduction has been a focus for scal year (FY) 2022; to date we are 41% under last year in total pounds, while delivery sales have increased by 39% over last year."
Continuing to test EV trucks and investigate onsite charging options.
"3 Costco Business Delivery Centers also have implemented procedures to use electric plug-in shore power, tying into the grid to allow our refrigerated trucks to maintain temperature while being loaded and stored."
"This eliminates the previous practice of running the diesel reefer engine, thereby saving fuel and reducing carbon emissions."
"Additionally, the Business Delivery eet utilizes telematics a routing system now on all 2017 and newer trucks."
"This allows us to identify opportunities to enhance mileage consumption through ecient routing, which also decreases idle time."
Suppliers Playing a RoleMany of our tr ansportation partners are introducing innovations and eciencies in their own operations.
"For example, Pasha Hawaii, an ocean shipping company that serves Hawaii from the continental United States, introduced in 2022 the MV George III , the rst liqueed natural gas (LNG) powered vessel to serve Hawaii."
"This technologically advanced vessel features a state-of-the-art engine, an optimized hull form and an underwater propulsion system with a high-eciency rudder and propeller."
A second vessel is also scheduled for service to Hawaii.
Pasha Hawaii is the principal carrier of Costco products from the mainland to Hawaii.
Costco LogisticsCostco Logistics is our service that provides nal mile delivery of goods across the U.
S. and Puerto Rico.
"With Costco Logistics, we have installation services, white glove capabilities for big and bulky products, and a dedicated call center."
"With over 1,500 employees, and nearly 100 facilities, Costco Logistics enables us to improve and grow our Ecommerce sales of big and bulky items at a faster rate, while improving overall member service and speed of delivery for these items."
"Employee TransportationCostco continues to encourage its employees to use alternative forms of transportation with the goal of reducing energy consumption, emissions and commuter gridlock."
"The Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) program began more than 20 years ago at the corporate oce with 18 vanpools, and by early 2020, had grown to 69 vans with 494 riders."
The pandemic and remote working opportunities have signicantly decreased employee need and/or interest in vanpools.
"4 At the end of FY22, we had 31 active vans, serving 180 riders."
"Vans, fuel, maintenance and insurance are provided by ve local transit agencies."
"Employees also receive a substantial nancial subsidy from Costco, which in many cases covers their entire monthly commute expenses."
Employees who regularly ride the bus are also eligible for this nancial subsidy.
"Costco also has vanpools at its San Diego, Los Angeles and Mexico City regional oces, as well as many Costco warehouses."
We also have many employees who choose to informally carpool with coworkers.
We also oer secure bicycle storage facilities and locker room use for employees who ride to work.
"Finally, recharging stations are available at our corporate oces for employees who drive electric vehicles."
"Charging S tationsCostco continues t o increase available electric vehicle charging stations in our warehouses, corporate oces and other facilities."
"5 Updated Dec 2022Energy & Refrigeration Costco understands that the use of clean energy and the way we manage and continuously improve our oper ational energy eciency, energy supply and refrigeration systems is critical for reducing our Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions."
"This section explains the steps we are taking in this important area of our global operations, including through our STAR program and improved monitoring tools."
Managing EnergyPurchased energy is the largest source of our Scope 2 carbon emissions.
"A majority of our energy use in our warehouses comes from HVAC, lighting, food preparation and heating water."
"To achieve our carbon reduction goals and reduce our emissions, we are purchasing clean energy and reducing our energy usage in our warehouses."
"Energy eciency also saves expenses, which helps us to remain a low-cost operator."
More information about our Scope 1 and 2 emissions can be found in our Climate Action Plan .
We have implemented energy management systems and tools to pr ovide us with data to help identify smart ways to reduce energy consumption.
Our strategy includes eorts to identify and share tools relating to energy with our warehouse operators.
"This includes our STAR program, which allows regional specialists to share best practices."
"Education and training for our employees, both in our corporate oces and in our warehouses, are key tools in reducing our carbon footprint, energy usage and warehouse expenses."
"Furthermore, 1 staying abreast of regulatory changes and new technological advancements is integral to the success of our energy program."
"In scal year (FY) 2023, we will oer Certied Energy Management training to our employees, focusing on developing expertise around energy practices."
"We also hold annual training sessions for our Global Sustainability & Compliance teams to share best practices, increase awareness and learn how to continue to reduce our carbon footprint and save energy."
Tracking & Reporting EmissionsW e have rolled out training and tools to support global site tracking and reporting of GHG carbon emissions source data.
"Our process for emissions tracking includes a step-by-step reference guide to support Costco-owned or Costco-leased sites, including warehouses, business centers, depots, distribution facilities, delivery operations, manufacturing sites and oces."
The process involves tracking all Scope 1 and Scope 2 sources at each location.
"Purchases for fuel, dry ice and CO2 (consumed) and/or refrigerant lls are also tracked."
These totals are entered into Costco's emissions platform at each site.
"Energy- Saving ProgressW e are continuously evaluating, testing and implementing energy-saving measures across our global facilities."
"Examples include: We are using energy and lighting management systems to contr ol heating and cooling set points, and set lighting schedules."
Another syst em provides information for system troubleshooting/diagnostics.
We are continuing to enhance system tools for lighting and refrigeration systems.
In our U.
"S. locations, this helps us nd ways to maximize energy eciencies."
"Case Example: Display Shields Warehouses are using display case shields, shown in this photo, and other shields t o reduce energy use."
"The shields are used during closed warehouse hours to reduce power use, while maintaining product temperature."
"As a result, there is less load on the refrigeration system with improved product temperature maintenance."
2 Locations in South Korea are equipped with centralized re and energy monitoring and control systems.
"Other management systems, including electrical, gas, refrigeration and elevator systems, are managed by a certied, on-site professional."
"As an example, the ventilation system and HVAC can be programmed or manually controlled by the centralized system in response to outside conditions (temperature, humidity and wind) to maintain the optimal indoor atmosphere and refrigeration, and to maximize energy conservation."
Each location examines monthly energy consumption to identify opportunities to improve.
Icelands geothermal system produces hot water that provides space heating and hot water supplies throughout our warehouse.
"In addition, this system facilitates snowmelt to free up sidewalks and key areas in front of the building, including the gas station forecourt (lling area) and the freight area ramp."
You can read more about energy-saving measures in our Climate Action Plan .
Clean EnergyWe have committed to 80% clean purchased energy by 2030.
"To meet this goal, we will sour ce an increasing percentage of contract purchases from low carbon energy sources through 2030 (and beyond)."
"Additionally, we own and operate more than 100 on-site solar systems around the world with intention to expand on-site solar operations where feasible."
3 Lighting SystemsWe continue to convert older U.
"S. warehouses to more energy- ecient LED lighting systems, and are doing the same throughout the company."
Our new warehouses use LED lighting technology.
Managing Refriger ants Costco r ecognizes that hydrouorocarbons (HFCs) and other gases in our refrigeration systems have a major impact on our climate.
W e continue t o explore new technologies and carefully select refrigerants that are low in Global Warming Potential (GWP) and reduce CO2e emissions.
Were taking these steps to manage refrigerants in our global operations: Reviewing our cooling and heating systems with an approach to int egrate them with our refrigeration systems for optimal performance.
Testing new state-of-the-art leak detection systems to identify r efrigerant leaks and trigger alerts for faster resolution.
"Retrotting our existing locations with high GWP refrigerants to lower refrigerants, such as CO2 refrigerants, as parts and labor are available, and where it is operationally viable."
"Working with certied contractors who adhere to best management practices in installing, maintaining and decommissioning equipment, and controlling leaks impacting the environment."
You can read more about refrigeration in our Climate Action Plan .
4 Case Example: Insulated Doors Installing insulated doors to the walk-in refrigeration point-of-sale coolers where possible in our U.
"S., Canada and Mexico locations, which are closed when we are not open."
These doors keep the coolers cool and put less stress on the refrigeration system.
"The savings are 25,000 to 35,000 kWh per location."
"Given these continued savings, we will continue to add the insulated doors in our new locations and remodels when appropriate."
Additional Energy- Related MeasuresWe are exploring additional energy-related measures that include: Eliminating skylights in new construction and covering skylights in existing locations to lessen the workload of HV A C systems.
Considering innovative system designs based on operational and r egional needs.
"For example, in some warmer climates, we have installed hybrid systems that use an energy-ecient combination of fans and water to cool refrigeration systems throughout the day."
"Obtaining platinum-level certication from the Environmental Protection Agencys GreenChill program, which includes this certication for two new warehouses that opened in the fall of 2021."

5 Updated Dec 2022Managing Water Costco understands the importance of water conservation and has adopted Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 Clean Water and Sanitation as one of our SDG goals.
W e have implement ed comprehensive water management programs to help us reduce operational water waste and improve the quality of both our wastewater and stormwater discharges.
We are also taking steps to use less water overall.
"Our Water Management SystemsMaking sur e we do whatever we can to avoid wasting water in our global operations is critical to our sustainability eor ts, fr om both environmental and economical viewpoints."
"From an environmental perspective, water is a precious and limited resource that cannot be wasted."
"With rising temperatures, water use is also rising, causing shortage concerns throughout the world."
"Economically for us, minimizing water waste lowers overall operating costs specically, sewer, energy and maintenance costs."
"Our goal worldwide is to use only what we need, and to reduce waste."
Water monitoring systems are currently in use in our warehouses in the U.
"S., Canada, Mexico, Korea, the UK and Japan."
We intend to expand monitoring systems to our other locations worldwide.
These systems enable our warehouse operators to: Detect mechanical failures in real-time for quick x es.
Identify oper ational water waste so that behaviors can be modied through education and training.
"Consume less water to lower the amount of energy and cost necessary to run mechanical equipment and systems, which in turn reduces Costcos carbon footprint, expenses and environmental impact."
1 Create an enhanced awareness of water use and stewardship throughout all facets of our operations.
"Meanwhile, we are assessing our water management systems t o consider new and emerging technologies that will enable us to manage water even more eciently in our operations."
"We recognize water management is a top priority when considering operational waste controls, in establishing baseline performance, in targeting eciencies and in considering innovative ways to drive improved performance by site."

Reduce carbon emissions.
"The STAR program is promoted in employee break rooms and supported by regional specialists who visit the buildings, and best pr actices are shared through the STAR News bulletin."
"For more information on STAR, see this story in the Costco Connection magazine."
STAR is a critical part of our water management eorts.
"While we havent nalized our water usage data systems, we are able to estimate our global wat er usage for the past thr ee years."
See below for a summary of our global operational water usage.
"2 Costcos Estimated Global Operational Water Usage Summary Sales ($MM)Gallons (000s)Water Use Increase (YoY)Water Intensity (000 gal / $MM sales) FY20$163,022 3,745,971* N/A 22.98 FY21 $192,052 4,027,322* 7.5% 20.97 FY22 $222,730 4,349,676 8.0%** 19.53 *Gallons for FY20 and FY21 have been restated due to improved information on usage."
"This reects an 8.5% and 9.8% increase, respectively, from previous reports."
"**We attribute a portion of our increased usage in FY22 to better data collection, opening and operating new locations, and including in our calculations Costco Logistics and our Chicken Plant operating at full capacity."
"Despite these usage increases, our water intensity continues to decrease year over year."
"New Approaches in LandscapingLandscaping around our facilities is important for the beauty it provides, and for preserving natural habitat."
"When we build new warehouses, we seek to include eective landscaping that uses the least amount of water possible."
"This entails integrating native, drought-resistant and articial landscaping materials to minimize irrigation."
Irrigation systems that use smart technologies and subsurface irrigation complement landscaping.
Our irrigation systems are monitored through meters that enable our operators to identify issues immediately and avoid expensive repairs later.
"Thanks to these systems, we are able to reduce water waste and protect assets such as parking lot surfaces, retaining walls and building foundations."
We are also nding these measures to be helpful: Using smart technologies and subsurface irrigation to improve eciency and reduce wat er wast e in irrigation systems.
Installing bioswales to preserve groundwater and prevent runo in select locations.
3 Before & After: An Example We are replacing landscaping in some warehouses with surfaces and features that use much less water.
We are nding signicant reductions in water usage and consequently our water bills through simple and relatively inexpensive options.
"For example, in 17 Bay Area Costcos, grass was replaced with landscaping that uses much less water, and drip irrigation systems were installed."
"With less water needed for irrigation, we are seeing annual water reductions of 6 million gallons or more, depending on the warehouse."
Before After Wastewater & Stormwater PlansEach U.
S. Costco location has wastewater and stormwater plans and procedures to ensure that we remain in compliance with local and federal regulations.
We have a team of Environmental Sustainability and Compliance Managers throughout the U.
"S. who, in partnership with our corporate water systems team, work directly with all locations to track and respond to water waste or quality concerns."
International locations are also focusing on waste and stormwater management.
"Examples of W ater SavingsW e are constantly seeking new ways to save water in our operations, in both small and large ways."
"Here are some recent examples: In 20 Me xico locations, all water used in the war ehouses (bathr ooms, fresh food areas and so on) go from the drains to on-site small treatment plants, instead of the sewer."
This treated water is then used for site irrigation.
"This not only reduces the impact on local sewer systems, but saves us money on irrigation costs (more than $450,000 in FY22)."
4 Locations throughout the U.
S. are reducing water usage by changing the way they clean the breezeway at the location entrance.
They switched from pressure washing to using the ride-on oor scrubber.
"Annual water usage was reduced from 75,000 gallons per year to less than 9,000 gallons based on a three-times-per-week schedule."
"In Australia, rainwater is captur ed and stored onsite for use in toilets, cooling refrigeration systems and irrigation."
"In the Los Angeles region, we ar e using a water capture system to catch rainwater and refrigeration condensate, which is stored on site in large, underground cisterns."
This water is used for irrigation.
If the tanks are ever completely full the location issues the water back to the city.
"Water Savings in Our Chicken Plant In 2019, Costco began selling chicken in our vertically integrated facility in Fremont, Nebraska, which was designed with water preservation, re-use, eciency and treatment in mind."
Costco worked with the city of Fremont to expand its wastewater treatment plant to ensure that the wastewater generated is treated before returning to the municipal wastewater treatment plant.
"In addition, through a process of air chilling, we save a substantial amount of water in comparison to typical water chill processing."
"5 Car Washes UCostco is a member of WaterSavers, a designation by the International Car Wash Association awarded to car washes that meet strict water usage criteria."
Wastewater in our on-site car washes is reduced in the following ways: Digital water met ering identies spik es in usage that indicate a potential leak or equipment malfunction.
"With real-time monitoring, these spikes can be addressed immediately."
Every wash has a reclaim system to lter and recycle water to be used for everything that does not require fresh water.
This cuts fresh water use by more than 50%.
Water main shut-o valves are utilized when the car wash is not in use.
All car washes strictly follow water usage permits and requirements.
6 pdated ec 2022DMinimizing Waste Costco understands our potential impact on the global waste stream and greenhouse gas emissions caused by waste generated within our global operations.
"Our goal is to continually decrease the amount of our waste going to landlls, with a goal to divert 80%."
"Here, well explain the steps we are taking to reach that goal."
You can click on this Global Waste Stream Report to see our annual report on waste diversion.
"Diverting Waste from LandllEective waste diversion conserves natural resources, saves energy, cuts expenses and reduces emissions."
"By diverting waste from the landll, Costco cuts back on hauling waste from our locations which reduces fuel consumption, CO2 emissions generated from transportation, and hauling costs."
We continue to examine waste disposal programs to maximize eciency and to reduce costs.
"Regarding our 80% diversion goal, in scal year (FY) 2022, we diverted 78.7% of our waste from landlls."
We dene waste diversion as the total tons (measured in U.
S. tons) of waste that is not directly dumped into landll sites or burned at incineration facilities that do not create energy.
We include Waste to Energy as part of our diversion program.
"Other diversion examples include donations, anaerobic digestion, recycling, composting and animal feed."
"Costco is committed to expanding these programs through partnerships, enhanced eciencies and emerging technologies."
"Tracking Emissions Reducing waste sent to landll is critical, as landlls emit methane during decomposition."
Costco started measuring its baseline for total waste emissions in FY21.
"Since then, we have estimated our total Scope 3 (GHG Protocol Category 5) waste emissions for all 1reporting Costco locations for FY20, FY21, and FY22 based upon the total tonnage to landll and total tonnage diverted."
"We reported 137,098 mtCO2e in FY20 and 147,347 mtCO2e in FY21."
"In FY22, we are reporting 154,140 mtCO2e."
"For more information on emissions, see our Climate Action Plan page."

"For food waste, we follow the Food Waste Hierarchy, as dened by the U."
S. Environmental Protection Agency (shown in graphic on the following page).
"We take a variety of steps to keep food out of landlls, whether its by creating a new product (source reduction), donating it to needy people, or feeding it to animals."
Source Reduction One way of reducing food waste in our operations is by creating new items for our members.
"For example, unsold rotisserie chickens are made into these deli items, reecting local tastes: Chicken Noodle Soup, Chicken Enchilada Bake, Chicken Alfredo and Chicken Pot Pies in the U."

Three Costco suppliers are working with the Equitable Food Initiative and Measure to Improve to pilot a waste reduction and tracking program that expands their worker engagement eorts to include a sustainability focus.
"Through this pilot, suppliers conducted baseline visual and physical audits of materials waste (cardboard, clamshells, etc."
"), green waste (culls) and food loss in 2021 to determine which priority actions to include in a waste reduction plan."
The companies are now implementing these programs and gathering data to measure their success in reducing waste and ultimately greenhouse gas emissions.
"The three farming operations partnering in this initiative are Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce/GoodFarms, Misionero and Windset Farms."
"3Please see additional examples of source reduction in the Kirkland Signature page in our Merchandising section , (under Reducing Food Waste)."
"Food Donations Costco has programs and partnerships with Feeding America , The Global FoodBanking Network and food banks to prevent food from being wasted."
Feeding America is a national organization in the U.
S. that works with local food banks as a bridge with our U.
S. locations.
The Global FoodBanking Network partners non-U.
S. locations with certied member organizations to donate to entities that have established food safety standards.
These eorts provide meals to individuals and families who are food insecure.
"We oer our food donation program in all states and most countries/regions where we operate, and have continued to grow our program year over year."
The U.
"S., Canada, and Mexico have added the ability to donate cooked food from our food courts by creating food safety procedures to properly cool and donate unsold items."

Using our inedible waste for animals is important because it reduces the demand to generate new resources.
"For example, our warehouses divert organic materials for feed to local programs, including animal sanctuaries, rescue centers, local farms for cattle, hogs and other animals, and city zoos."
This global eort saves millions of pounds of food materials from landlls.
"Also, in our Japan warehouses, coee grounds from the Food Courts are sent to the Kalm Kakuyama Organic Farm, which uses them as bedding for the cows."
The coee grounds are valuable because of their antibacterial and odor-reducing eect.
"The organic milk from these cows is available in our all Japanese warehouses, completing a unique circle of sustainability."
"(Also, the coee grounds eventually end up as biogas fuel to generate electricity on the farm)."
"Also in Japan, coee grounds are sent from one warehouse to be repurposed as cattle feed."
Industrial Uses .
"Much of our organic waste is also recycled into usable products, such as organic fertilizer, biofuels and electricity."
Here are some examples of this approach at work: Chicken grease produced from rotisserie chickens is converted into biofuel.
Meat and bone scraps are processed through a rendering program.
"Rendering from the chicken complex in Lincoln, Nebraska, has been added to this program."
Organic waste is converted into certied organic liquid fertilizer.
Food is recycled at anaerobic digestion facilities to create energy.

Costco is committed to reducing non-food waste through eciencies and other programs.
Here are several examples.
"Donating Costco has grown its program with World Vision to donate rst-quality items that used to be destroyed, recycled or returned to the supplier."
These items are donated to people in need around the world.
"More information can be found in the Costco-World Vision Summary , which contains a list of the items donated and some stories that illustrate the impact of these donations."
"Besides providing items to people in need, eciencies are also gained, including reduced trips to the landll and savings on trash fees for both Costco and our suppliers."
"Reducing Non-Food Waste 6Summary of Non-Foods Donation FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21* FY22* Number of Pallets allets allets Donat Donat Donat ed ed ed (Pallets)41,945 42,493 54,332 80,304 131,438 Product Value ($, Millions)$76.2 $79.9 $137 $278 *The number of pallets signicantly increased in FY21-22 because our growing Costco Logistics program, which delivers appliances, TVs and other large it ems pur chased on Costco.com, is now part of our donation program."
Recycling We have developed programs to recycle a wide variety of materials (actual amounts are shown in this Global Waste Stream Report ): Corrugated Cardboard and Shrink-Wrap.
Warehouses routinely send shrink-wrap and corrugated material generated from daily operations to our distribution centers for recycling.
"For eciency, we backhaul these materials, meaning theyre placed in empty trucks that have just delivered goods to the warehouse and are returning to the local depot."
Tires .
"While 15% of our tires are resold, over 80% are recycled into several dierent benecial uses like tire-derived fuels used primarily in cement kilns; crumb rubber used as an additive for road surfaces or pervious surfaces around roads, sidewalks and pathways; mine reclamation; daily landll cover; and decorative mulch."
Car Battery Recycling .
Costco reimburses members their core fee when batteries are returned for recycling.
Returned batteries are collected and picked up for recycling by Costco battery suppliers.
Up to 99% of a car battery is recyclable and can be used to make new batteries and other products.
Paper .
"Costco has established a recycling program for paper in our oces and warehouses to capture loose paper, coupon brochures, magazines and paperback books that are no longer usable or saleable."
We continue to move to paperless programs when applicable.

"Reducing Hazardous WReducing Hazardous W astastee Hazar dous materials pose a risk to the environment, human health and/or the communities we operate."
"These include common everyday items such as dish soaps, detergents, batteries, light bulbs and electronics."
"As with other waste programs, Costco follows a hierarchy to reduce or eliminate hazardous waste."
Prevention is the most desired path when dealing with hazardous products.

"9Updated Dec 2022Environmental Compliance Our Code of Ethics calls for us to obey the law, and complying with environmental regulations is an e xample of that mandate."
Our environmental compliance eorts are integral to our corporate sustainability initiatives.
"The Role of ComplianceTo help us meet our sustainability goals, we have implemented a comprehensive environmental compliance program that covers regulations related to stormwater, sanitary water use, wetlands, environmental mitigation, endangered species, air quality and more."
"The program applies to inspections, maintenance and reporting for all of our properties, including our warehouses (retail locations) as well as our industrial properties (manufacturing, distribution, logistics, etc.)."
"Our global compliance team works in conjunction with representatives from numerous departments throughout the company to review and identify opportunities to enhance compliance and sustainability programs and policies, as well as to ensure we remain in compliance with regulatory requirements."
"Team members also support location operators in daily operations, training and educational opportunities."
"Finally, team members have been instrumental in helping us implement our Climate Action Plan ."
"In 2022, we held our fourth annual Global Sustainability Summit."
"The purpose of these summits ar e to share best practices, review compliance, and discuss upcoming projects, with the goal of creating a consistent and global approach to environmental compliance, while also respecting local laws and regulations."
1 STAR in the WarehousesWe continue to build on our existing environmental compliance platform through the Sustainability Technical Assistance Review (STAR) program to formalize standards and requirements in ve key focus areas.
"By working toward STAR goals, Costco is building the capabilities to track compliance and dynamically monitor resource use at all our warehouses."
"Our aim is to integrate the people, systems, policies, data and standard operating procedures in support of the following ve focus areas: Ensur e environmental compliance Govern water use inside and outside our facilities Minimize energy consumption Increase waste diversion Reduce carbon emissions The STAR program is promoted in employee break rooms and suppor ted by regional specialists who visit the buildings, and best practices are shared through the STAR News bulletin."
Enhanced data dashboarding programs and reporting capabilities added in 2022 allow us to respond more quickly as any situations arise.
We also continue to digitize our environmental records and automate compliance programs to aid in both accuracy and eciency while reducing operator fatigue.
"Meanwhile, we are continuing to build a Central Monitoring program (Central Station) to bring refrigeration, burglary and re monitoring of our warehouses, depots and other buildings in-house."
"2U pdated ec 2022DAnimal Welfare Animal welfare is part of Costcos culture and responsibility, and we are committed to a global approach to Animal Welfare."
"We are working toward a uniform program in the countries/regions where we operate, while respecting that each country may have its own regulatory and social requirements."
Our Mission StatementCostco is committed to the welfare and proper handling of animals that are used in the production of products that we sell.
"This is not only the right thing to do, but it also is an important moral and ethical obligation we owe to our members, suppliers, and most of all to the animals we depend on for these products."
Costco has adopted the Five Domains for assessing animal welfare.
The domains are: Nutrition.
Environment.
Health.
Behavior.
Mental state.
"The Five Domains take into account that if animals have positive experiences in the rst four physical/functional domains, then the end result would be a positive e xperience with the fth domain a good mental stat e, leading to good welfare and a positive quality of life."
"We have worked with Dr. Temple Grandin (click here for more information), an independent and prominent animal welfare expert, in adopting these domains."
"1 You can nd additional resources concerning the Five Domains at these sites: MDPI National Libr ary of Medicine ""The Five Domains emphasize the importance of both pr eventing suering and providing animals with positive experiences."""
"Dr. Temple Grandin Collaboration with Exper ts & SuppliersWe coordinate our eorts in this area through an Animal Welfare Task Force, made up of members from corporate and regional buying, animal welfare auditing, global sustainability and compliance, legal and global food safety departments."
Our eorts are informed by various global standards and benchmarks pertaining to animal welfare.
"We seek to stay abreast of new technologies and methods through our suppliers, academia and industry experts."
We also have engaged with the Center for Food Integrity in these eorts.
"*According to supplier reports 2 Antibiotics OverviewCostcos goal is to be judicious in the use of antibiotics that are medically important to humans in our meat and poultry supply chains, which is consistent with our goal of protecting the health and welfare of our members."
Our objective is that producers follow the FDA Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) nal rule ( 21 C.
F.R section 558.6 ) regarding how medically important antibiotics can be administered to food-producing animals.
"Medically important antibiotics are to be limited to therapeutic use only for the prevention, control and treatment of disease under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian in a valid veterinary client/patient relationship."
You can read more on the FD A website .
"In 2022, we continued our engagement with our suppliers."
It remains dicult in many supply chains t o obtain veriable certicates or adavits in order to have quantitative metrics regarding the phase-out of routine use of shared use antibiotics.
"Supply chains are, for the most part, only minimally vertically integrated (particularly for beef and pork), with our suppliers being one too many steps removed from those who are raising animals."
Many of these growers lack developed systems for aggregating metrics concerning antibiotic usage.
This makes it very dicult for our suppliers to gather and aggregate such information to report to us and to track changes in metrics over time.
We have partnered with Progressive Beef to learn more about antibiotic use in the beef supply chain and how documentation can be generated and shared in the future.
3 Chicken Antibiotic Update We continue to work with our chicken suppliers and have made progress on our previous commitments.
Please see the table below.
"Pr revious Commitmentevious Commitment 2022 Update By the end of 2022, 95% of Kirkland In FY22, we sent a survey to our Kirkland Signature chicken products (dened as Signature chicken suppliers (dened as frozen, sold in the meat case, rotisserie case frozen, sold in the meat case, rotisserie case and raised with No Antibiotics Ever) sold in the and canned sold in the U."

We do not have this data at this such time as our target of 100% is reached.
time and will work with our suppliers whopurchase from third parties to determineantibiotic use and comply with our policy.
"Scope and Risk-Based Phased ApproachBecause of the number of suppliers Costco has and their geographic dispersion, it is not practical to audit on an ongoing basis to conrm that all suppliers are in compliance with all aspects of our animal welfare policies."
"Accordingly, we take a risk-based approach with respect to targeting audits and otherwise seeking to conrm compliance."
"The approach is based upon several factors, including prior audit performance."
"This has resulted in placing emphasis on auditing suppliers of Kirkland Signature items, particularly in the United States."
"Even as to those items, however, the large number of producers in the supply chain limits the scope and frequency of audits that may feasibly be conducted and evaluated."
"4 Animal Welfare AuditsCostco utilizes recognized audit standards and programs conducted by trained auditors, and looks at animal welfare both on the farm and at processing."
"The purpose of an audit is to gather current, accurate information concerning the overall welfare of animals."
"This information is made available to members of the Costco food safety and technology group, and buying sta."
Audits apply to: Onfarm audits .
These inspect the welfare of live animals on the farm in their living environment.
"Curr ently these ar e conducted for the following species to varying degrees: chicken (egglaying hens), dairy cows, pork, poultry (chicken and turkey), and veal."
Meat plant audits .
"These take place at the plant where animals are processed for these species: beef, pork, poultry (chicken and turkey), and veal."
"Audits can be conducted by Costco auditors, suppliers and/or thir d par ties."
"Audit type, frequency and intensity can vary across suppliers and species."
Costco requires U.
S. animal welfare auditors to be certied.
Organic certication in the U.
S. in certain respects also includes animal welfare components.
"Costco sells large quantities of organic items derived from animal products, and these items are required to be certied organic in accordance with the law."
Below we outline our current animal welfare audit policies and procedures by species.
Beef Costco requires third-party animal welfare audits at processing in accordance with the North American Meat Institute Recommended Animal Handling Guidelines.
5 Dairy Costco requires animal welfare audits at the farm level.
We have worked with third-party audit providers as well as parties that can implement second-party dairy audits.
"Our goal is to have an outcome-based program that recognizes sustainable practices in place and guides change at the dairy through training, sound protocols and a valid Veterinary Client Patient Relationship."
The National Dairy FARM Program (Farmers Assuring Responsible Management) seeks to provide consistency and uniformity to best practices in animal care and quality assurance in the dairy industry.
Costco works with larger cooperative suppliers that utilize the FARM Program to increase the frequency of thirdparty verication.
Costco does not support tail docking and has actively sought to use suppliers that do not allow this practice.
Current suppliers do not practice tail docking.
Costco requires its suppliers to implement standards regarding age and pain management as it relates to dehorning practices.
Costco strongly supports advances in dairy farming practices to include the use of genetic breeding programs to promote polled cattle (naturally hornless).
Costco believes this will benet the welfare of the cows and of the farmers who care for them by eliminating the need for dehorning.
Costco recognizes that through the years its suppliers have embraced new ways to improve the welfare of the animals in their care.
Costco expects suppliers to continue to seek improvements that promote good animal health and wellbeing.
6 Veal Costco veal is traceable to the farm level and farms are inspected for compliance to the requirements.
Here is our veal policy: Inhumane treatment of calves is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at any stage of the animals life.
Calves must never be tethered while in a stall.
There must be a minimum of two calves per stall after 8 to 10 weeks of age.
(This is dependent upon calf behavior and health issues that would require a calf to be separated).
"All stalls must be large enough to allow calves to freely turn around, lie down and maintain normal postures."
Calves must be inspected at least twice daily by the farmer or caregiver to ensure cleanliness of the animals as well as the stall.
The farmer or caregiver will also ensure proper fresh air and ventilation at all times.
Calf diets must consist of nutritious feed and fresh water.
"Veal barns are to receive, at a minimum, one annual third-party humane handling audit per year."
These audits are to be made available to Costco Wholesale.
Veal barns are to be visited by a veterinarian at a minimum of once every grow-out cycle.
Electric prods are never to be used.
Non-ambulatory animals are never to be used in production.
Poultry Costco requires animal welfare audits at processing in accordance with the National Chicken Council (NCC) Recommended Animal Handling Guidelines and the National Turkey Federation Animal Care Guidelines .
Costco also audits hatchery and growout facilities.
Costco implements animal welfare audits for laying hens.
"Audits can include American Humane , Certied Humane and United Egg Producers audits."
"Audits now extend in varying degrees to conventional cage, cagefree and organic housing systems."
7 Costcos Broiler Policy Costco Wholesale is committed to the welfare of animals in its supply chains.
"This includes broilers, which are chickens raised for meat (as opposed to eggs)."
"Although these chickens have a life cycle of less than 45 days, their welfare is as important as that of animals that have longer life cycles."
"Most of our poultry needs are met by our complex in Nebraska (Lincoln Premium Poultry or LPP) and two other facilities in the Southeast, which are owned by third parties."
"One of these producers is certied organic, which brings with it animal-welfare requirements prescribed by the United States Department of Agriculture."
These three facilities are our primary suppliers (which we call dedicated suppliers).
"With respect to our dedicated suppliers: all broilers are cage-free, in chicken houses where they are free to move about without restriction."
The minimum standards followed in these barns are based on those developed by the National Chicken Council (NCC).
These can be found by clicking here.
The National Chicken Council represents companies that account for approximately 95 percent of broiler chicken production in the United States.
"For our dedicated suppliers, compliance with the NCC standards is regularly audited by third-party auditors, who are independent of Costco and the producers and are certied by the Professional Animal Auditor Certication Organization (PAACO)."
"For more about PAACO, click here."
An important element of broiler welfare is how the animals are prepared for production.
LPP and our dedicated organic supplier use a technique called Controlled Atmosphere Stunning (CAS).
"That technique is recognized as a superior method for processing, using methods that are calming for the animals and conducive to the welfare of employees who monitor the process."
We are exploring the potential for transition to CAS at other facilities.
"Our broiler welfare eorts are currently most highly focused on LPP, which raises around 100 million birds per year."
"In addition to CAS, LPP has adopted or is focusing on other key elements of welfare: Density ."
"In evaluating density, it is important to keep in mind that the broilers at LPP are raised to a weight smaller than industry average."
"When applying density standards that are expressed in weight per area, it is also important to remember that birds are under the maximum weight for the vast majority of their lives."
Our dedicated suppliers are operating at a density standard of at least .92 square feet per bird.
Catching and Transport .
LPP uses what it regards as state of the art equipment for gathering of birds when they are ready to leave the barns.
This highly automated system reduces opportunities for human mistakes that can occur with manual processes.
"In addition, the transportation of broilers occurs with covering and ventilation options that are adaptable to the wide range of weather conditions found in Nebraska and Iowa."
Barn Enrichment .
Some in the industry have experimented with features believed to enrich the experience of broilers in their barns.
LPP has been monitoring studies that examine whether these enrichments actually improve outcomes or benet farmworkers who work with the broilers.
"In addition, LPP is experimenting with enrichments in a small number of barns, to evaluate whether wider deployment is warranted."
8 Costcos Broiler Policy (continued) Breeding .
Some parties have advocated that Costco and others change to breeds that grow more slowly.
We have carefully analyzed the science that has been invoked for that position.
"We do not believe that the conclusions, which thus far are not the product of the rigorous peer review process associated with scientic papers, warrant a change in our practices at this time."
"Because of the density we prescribe for our broilers and the fact that our broilers are grown to a smaller size than is common in the industry, we believe that the incidence of adverse welfare impacts associated with larger fast-growing broilers under more crowded conditions is lower at LPP."
"At a time when Costco Wholesale is intensely focused on reducing its carbon footprint, we also have concerns that slower-growing breeds increase environmental impacts (greater feed demands, more energy usage, higher waste output), which should not be incurred absent meaningful gains in broiler welfare."
"As we increase engagement with our suppliers over reducing emissions in the production of goods for us, it is important that we set a good example in our own operations."
"We are engaged in communications with our breeding stock suppliers and study concerning selection that could over time enhance the leg strength of broilers, in an eort to reduce mobility problems and other issues."
The nature of selective breeding means that this process occurs slowly.
"While we believe we have achieved signicant progress in our broiler welfare programs, we recognize that there is room for improvement."
LPP has engaged a full-time animal welfare ocer and a full-time auditor for growers (in addition to the veterinarian on sta) and enhanced the training requirements for auditors that work in barns that supply it.
LPPs objective is to audit each grower three times annually.
"Early in 2021 we engaged the services of Dr. Temple Grandin, an independent and prominent animal welfare expert, to examine the practices at LPP and make recommendations for enhancements."
"Dr. Grandin (click here for more information) has provided her recommendations, which are now in various stages of implementation."
"Among other things, they entail enhanced education for farmers raising broilers, improvement of hatchery procedures, improved security for barns, and reduced stocking density."
Many of her recommendations have been adopted.
"A variety of external events have slowed some of our intended progress, but we remain committed to improvements."
9 *According to supplier reports Laying HensCostco has introduced the Costco Hen House Audit in the U.
S.
This tool seeks to promote a sense of responsibility and accountability to the supplier and provides a means for annual barn evaluations: Suppliers are r equir ed to audit each house twice a year using the Costco Hen House app platform.
The results are automatically transmitted to Costco upon completion.
The app-based system gives visual examples of how to score each question as needed.
"The app requires the supplier to submit photo documentation for each question, along with the answer as applicable."
Cage-Free EggsCostco is committed to procuring cagefree eggs.
"In FY22, we increased the percentage of cage-free shell eggs it sells worldwide as indicated in the table on the following page."
"In addition, Kirkland Signature Liquid Eggs are cage-free in the U."
S.
The transition to cage-free eggs will continue to increase with added availability and capacity of cage-free production.
Supply shortages in the U.
S. have recently required us to source a small quantity of non- cage-free eggs to meet our member requirements.
We expect this to be temporary.
"10 Percentage of Cage-Free Shell Eggs by Country Regions FY19 FY20 FY21 FY224 Australia159.6% 48.2% 43.8% 50.5% Canada 23.7% 22.8% 22.9% 22.7% China2N/A 0% 0% 2.1% France 100% 100% 100% 100% Iceland 100% 100% 100% 100% Japan20.6% 0.8% 2.9% 3.6% Mexico 91% 97.3% 100% 100% South Korea 3.4% 9.6% 18.7% 77.7% Spain 100% 100% 100% 100% Taiwan2,30% 0% 8.1% 13.8% United Kingdom 100% 100% 100% 100% United States 90.7% 93.2% 94.2% 97.0% Global 70.8% 72.3% 73.9% 79.7% 1) Australias cage-free suppliers are experiencing supply issues, causing some to struggle with the transition from conventional to cage-free eggs (construction supply, costs, etc)."
"2) Our progress in Taiwan, China and Japan is dependent upon local available infrastructure and appropriate food-safety practices."
"Taiwan, China and Japan are selling cage-free eggs in select locations and will continue to expand based on availability."
"3) In Taiwan, all eggs sold come from larger enriched cages, improving bird welfare by providing them with more usable space, scratch pads/mats, perches and nest boxes, allowing the hens to perform more natural behavior."
"4) In FY22, we are now including Business Centers and Ecommerce sales for U."
"S., Canada and Korea."
"11 Our Vertically Integrated Poultry FacilityIn 2019, Costco began selling chicken produced in our vertically integrated facility located in Fremont, Nebraska, which is described in more detail on the Kirkland Signature page of our Merchandising section ."
"Animal welfare is a critical component that has been integrated into all aspects of the chicken supply chain, from the hatchery to the grower barns to the processing facility."
"The design of the buildings and equipment, and corresponding pr ograms to handle the chickens, featured animal welfare as a key component and included the following: The latest technology for poultry handling and processing incorporated into the hatchery, feed mill and processing facility."
"The farmer-owned barns for the pullet, breeder and broiler chickens are state of the art in design and equipment."
The animal handling processes also incorporate strict animal welfare programs and a summar y of some of these policies include the following: S tocking density is limited to allow birds more space.
All barns have automated ventilation systems designed to improve bird air quality and comfort.
Apollo Gen 2 automatic harvesters are used to more humanely collect our broilers.
Broiler transport includes trailers with curtains to keep animals sheltered.
"Broilers are unloaded inside a lairage area, to protect them from the weather and help the birds acclimate."
The lairage area can hold approximately 2-hour inventory to allow birds to rest.
State-of-the-art Controlled Atmosphere Stunning (CAS) system.
Down & F eathersCostco has committ ed to r esponsible down sour cing.
Costco now requires a certication to be present with all Costco production of down and feather products.
"Costco accepts certications from International Down and Feather Lab (IDFL), Downpass or Responsible Down Standard (RDS)."
"12 Compliance to these standards promotes ethical sourcing of down and feathers through the verication of supplier traceability systems, general animal welfare, risk assessment and other important best practices."
"For more information, see the Costco Connection article, Downs upside ."
Pork Costco uses the P ork Quality Assurance Plus program .
"This is a producerdriven program that farmers can use to ensure that pork products are of the highest quality and are safe, and animals are cared for in a way that ensures their wellbeing."
We encourage suppliers to limit the use of gestation crates for pregnant sows in favor of group housing.
"Based upon supplier reported data, as of November 2022, approximately 92% of Costcos fresh pork and all of the Kirkland Signature cooler items sold in the U."
S. come from sows raised in group housing or connement that permit sows to turn around.
Approximately one third of our U.
S. fresh pork supply is now from California Proposition 12-compliant housing.
The proposition requires that breeding sows and their immediate ospring have at least 24 square feet of usable oor space per sow.
Legal developments concerning Prop 12 could impact this in the coming months.
Costco U.
"S. and Canada plan to source pork from suppliers utilizing only open-pen housing beginning in calendar 2023 for all fresh pork and Kirkland Signature cooler items, subject to supply chain capacity."
There may be certain times during a sow's gestation period when she should be separated from the rest of the group.
An example of this is the time between insemination and conrmation of pregnancy.
Our goal over time is to minimize the time in connement.
"Over the long term, we will target suppliers outside the United States and Canada for compliance, to the extent they are not held by local law to the same standard or a higher standard; and work with suppliers to achieve compliance for branded (non-Kirkland Signature) cooler items to further reduce the number of days that breeding sows spend in gestation crates."
13 *According to supplier reportsMonkeys & Coconut HarvestingCostco does not support the use of monkeys for coconut harvesting.
We require our suppliers to contractually prohibit the use of any animal labor from their coconut providers.
We also require these suppliers to audit their farms and have a third party independently verify compliance.
14 Updated Dec 2022Environmental Impacts & Land Stewardship Costco understands that it has a responsibility to source its products in a way that is respectful to the environment and to the people associated with that environment.
"Our goal is to help provide a net positive impact for communities in commodity-producing areas by doing our part to help reduce the loss of natural forests and other natural ecosystems, which include native and/or intact grasslands, peatlands, savannahs and wetlands."
Pollinator health is part of this eort.
Land Stewardship GoalsWe want to work with suppliers and others to support good land stewar dship practices that respect the autonomy and property rights of the landowner; are outcome-based rather than prescriptive; and respect the ability of rural people and their communities to thrive while serving as stewards of the land.
"Good land stewardship practices include, but are not limited to: Avoiding deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems."
Conserving or r est oring natural ecosystems.
Protecting High Conservation Value (HCV) and High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests.
"Requiring free, prior and informed consent of indigenous people."
Respecting basic human rights.
Avoiding pollution.
Protecting water resources.
Protecting from harmful chemicals.
"1 Protecting, restoring and promoting soil health."
Supporting the increased healthy production-eciency of lands currently in production.
Forest Conservation CommitmentDeforestation is occurring at a rapid rat e as natural forest landscapes are converted to land used for gr owing livest ock and agriculture.
"These natural ecosystems provide high environmental and social value, including habitat for diverse animal species, carbon sinks and long-term livelihoods for people living in and near these forests."
"We believe that our most impactful rst steps are to (1) source our wood, paper and ber-based products from responsibly managed and certied forests, and (2) use recycled content and alt ernative bers when feasible."
"While we desire all products to be sourced this way and encourage our suppliers to follow this goal, we have focused our eorts on our Kirkland Signature products."
Our goals are explained in our F orest Conservation Commitment .
"Certied Product Costco accepts forest management certications from three leading organizations: Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)1, Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certication (PEFC), with a preference for FSC."
These certications help to ensure that the needs of the forest ecosystems and their communities are balanced with conservation.
"Virgin & Recycled FibersVirgin bers and recycled bers both play important roles in making everyday products like paper, cardboard and bath tissue."
"Fiber products ar e not innitely recyclable after about seven times they degrade, lose their strength and are no longer usable."
This is why virgin bers have an important role.
"Virgin bers are valued for products that require their strength, softness, color and absorbance qualities, such as premium bath tissue."
"To reduce our use of virgin ber, we have a preference for recycled ber where feasible and where we believe it is a more sustainable alternative to virgin ber."
"The nal choice of ber will be determined by quality and food safety requirements, product specication and performance, and legal requirements."
1.
"Costcos FSC license code FSC-N003307 2 Recycled bers, in contrast, are the best choice for making such things as cardboard and packaging, which dont require as much softness or absorbency."
"For these reasons, responsible forest management is an important component in sourcing ber for paper-based packaging."
"Costco is committed to sourcing the ber used for its products and packaging to come from known sources, be legally harvested under certied forest management programs and not contribute to deforestation or degradation."
"A major focus for us is to bring more recycled content into packaging, especially with Kirkland Signature products, where we have the most inuence."
"Five Key CommoditiesW e are committed to eliminating deforestation in ve key commodities in our Kirkland Signature supply chains that contribut e t o deforestation: palm oil, wood/pulp/paper, soy, cocoa and beef."
You can nd details on how we source products in these categories by going to Commodities & More on our Merchandising page .
Palm Oil: Costco is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable P alm Oil (RSPO) and were committed to ensuring that the palm oil and associated products are responsibly sourced.
"Wood, Pulp & Paper ."
"We are committed to sourcing from certied forests all of our wood, pulp and paper products."
Soy.
"Because soy is a major driver of tropical deforestation in countries such as Brazil, we source Kirkland Signature soy-based products, such as Kirkland Signature soybean oil, vegetable oil and organic soy beverages, from the U."
S. and Canada.
3 Cocoa .
Costco supports eorts to eliminate deforestation in cocoa production.
"Working through the Sassandra Cocoa program, we are funding the distribution and replanting of trees, and working to increase the number of farmers participating in the program."
Beef .
"With concerns that beef production contributes to tropical deforestation in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Paraguay, our intent is not to source beef from high-risk deforestation regions until comprehensive traceability and monitoring systems are in place."
We update our progress on deforestation eorts each year in this Sustainability Commitment.
"Also, in scal year 2022 for the rst time we disclosed sourcing information about these forest risk commodities through the CDP Forest questionnaire."
"This report is available through CDP, a global disclosure system."
"Pollinator HealthNative pollinators and managed honeybee populations are threatened by pests, pathogens, pesticides and poor nutrition."
"These pollinat ors ar e necessary for pollinating approximately one-third of the food we eat, including many fruits, nuts and vegetables."
"More information can be found in our Costco Connection article, Honeybee health ."
"Were supporting pollinator health through research, smart agricultural pr actices and more: Supporting Research ."
"Tapping a portion of the sales from our Kirkland Signature honey, we nancially support Project Apis m ."
"This group funds critical research, oers information on best forage practices for bees, and serves as a resource to beekeepers, growers and others."
More information can be found on the Project Apis m.
"Blog and on the Oils, Honey & Spices page in our Merchandising section ."
4 Promoting Pollinator-Friendly Agricultural Practices .
We work with our fresh produce and almond suppliers to encourage the planting of buer zones to benet pollinators.
"We also encourage almond growers to use cover crops to increase the density, diversity and duration of bee forage in California orchards, which also improves soil health."
See this Costco Connection article for information on the Seeds for Bees program of Project Apis m .
"In the American Midwest, a critical area where eorts are focused to support honey production, pollination and native pollinators, we are working with The Bee and Buttery Habitat Funds Seed A Legacy Program."
See this report for more information on this program.
"Reducing Chemical UseWe are taking these steps to help reduce chemicals in our live goods, fruit and vegetables to suppor t pollinat or health: Pollinator Health Policy."
"Our Pollinator Health Policy involves suppliers of live goods (garden plants), fruit and vegetables."
"Costco encourages these suppliers to limit the use of non-essential chemicals, utilize eco-friendly methods of pest and disease control, and incorporate Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies and other creative solutions for the use of least toxic alternatives."
"Suppliers are encouraged to phase out the use of neonicotinoids and chlorpyrifos, unless mandated otherwise by law and when possible to avoid regrettable substitutions."
"Costco seeks to partner with suppliers that share our commitment to pollinator health and IPM, and make reasonable progress in a timely manner."
Other practices to support pollinator health.
"Our global suppliers repor t various eor ts being done to support pollinator health and improve on farm practices such as integrated pest management (IPM); scout and monitor pest and pathogen to proactively manage their population; use of benecial insects, biological alternatives, oils and soaps; physically excluding plant pests by creating barriers and separations; working with extension oces and/or local government; setting aside land for pollinator habitat and planting other pollinator friendly native plants; and increasing regenerative and organic growing practices."
5 Equitable Food Initiative (EFI) .
"Costco is part of EFI, a fresh produce eort consisting of farmers, suppliers and NGOs working to improve labor practices, environmental stewardship and food safety for the benet of workers, agricultural communities, businesses and consumers."
See the Human Rights page in our Merchandising section for full details.
"In addition to labor and food safety standards, EFI addresses pollinator health by requiring participating members to have: An implemented Integrated Pest Management plan that includes a stepped approach starting with biological controls followed by cultural, physical, and nally chemical responses."
Application records for conventional and open elds operations to be entered into the Pesticide Risk Tool (PRT) to generate a risk assessment to guide spray decisions.
EFI continues to partner with The IPM Institute of North America to aggregate and analyze pesticide application records entered into the PRT.
"A written justication for each application of a highly hazardous pesticide, aligned with their IPM plan and documenting that risk management measures were implemented during application."
"Irrigation practices that limit erosion, and uncultivated buer strips t o further protect water habitats."
"Worker training for appropriate pesticide use, which addresses prohibit ed o-label pesticide use; proper personal protective equipment; reporting procedures about all applications; and medical monitoring of workers handling certain pesticides."

6 Product Spotlight: Almond Beverage U DSilk unveiled its rst lineup of Bee Better Certied almond milk products available at Costco.
"The Bee Better Certication applies to Silks line of organic products sold at Costco including original, unsweetened, and unsweetened vanilla products, and represents a veried achievement to make almond farms better for bees."
"Almond farms certied to the Bee Better standard have planted habitat to provide food and shelter to bees, and promote integrated pest management practices that are safer for bees."
"Read more about this product in our Silk Brand Showcase and in this article , Bee Better Certied: One Acre At A Time."
Supporting Regenerative AgricultureCostco believes protecting and regenerating nature is imperative and the right thing to do.
"We strongly encourage our suppliers to follow the principles of regenerative agriculture, which include practices that minimize soil disturbance, increase plant diversity, keep living roots in the ground year-round, keep soils covered and integrate animals back onto the land."
These principles help create healthier soil.
"Healthy soils are critical to long-term agricultural production because they reduce plant vulnerability, can improve crop production and can improve farm protability."
"Increasing the organic matter in soil helps the land hold and retain more water, which is critical in times of drought or excessive rainfall."
7 pdated ec 2022Chemical Management Costcos Chemical Management Policy strives to protect the health and safety of our members and the environment.
"Through various processes we aim to deliver products that are safer, healthier and more sustainable."
"Our ApproachThrough our Chemical Management Policy, we aim to go beyond the boundaries of regulatory compliance, in an eort to reduce or remove potential chemical harm to humans and to the environment."
"In addition to contractually requiring our suppliers to comply with laws regarding chemicals in products and packaging, we provide guidance for preferred chemical choices by product category."
We encourage suppliers to understand the chemicals that are used in their products in order to: Identify chemicals of concern (COCs) utilizing compr ehensive testing programs.
Remove or apply the pr ocess of informed substitution for any identied COCs.
Identify ways to change their manufacturing processes to reduce hazardous chemical use.
Review and obtain qualied third-party green certications.
"1 Chemical Testing & The Costco Smart Screening ProgramCostco tests many product categories worldwide for the chemicals regulated in the countries where we do business: Product categories tested include toys and other products intended for childr en, food use, furniture, electrical, apparel and home textiles."
"Examples of regulated chemicals include soluble heavy metals, heavy metals found in surface coating, Substance of Very High Concern (SVHCs), formaldehyde, ame retardants, dyes, phthalates, BPA and PFAS."
Costco regularly updates its Global Costco Restricted Substance Lists (RSLs; see lists below) to keep up with global regulatory chemical restrictions in consumer products.

"Beyond testing of many items for compliance with regulatory requirements, we work with major third-party laboratories to identify and test for COCs in many items that are not legally prohibited."
We call this the Costco Smart Screening Program.
"These requirements include regulatory, industry and Costco analytical standards."
2 Textiles The largest category of products in the Costco Smart Screening Program is textiles.
This area is based on the Apparel and Footwear International RSL Management (AFIRM) Working Group.
The AFIRM Restricted Substance List (RSL) has been adopted by the third-party testing labs that perform testing on Costcos textile and footwear products.
"Examples of products tested include apparel and footwear, sporting goods, luggage, handbags and home textiles such as blankets, sheets, rugs and towels."
"More information, including publication of AFIRMS RSL and Packaging RSL, which is used for testing Costco products, can be found at the AFIRM Group website ."
Costco encourages its textile suppliers to implement in their supply chains the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Manufacturing Restrict ed Substance List (MRSL).
"This manufacturers RSL assists factories in protecting workers, creating safe products for our members and eliminating harmful chemicals to the planet."
Some examples of other third-party certication programs include: The Blue Way by BLUESIGN represents the vision and mindset of responsible and sustainable manufacturing of textile consumer products.
More information can be found on the BLUESIGN website.
The STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX program is designed to protect consumer and environmental health by removing chemicals of concern (COCs) from products and their components.
The STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX is an independent verication that products have been tested for harmful substances.
More information can be found on the OEKO-TEX Standard website.
"The LEATHER STANDARD by OEKO-TEX is an internationally standardized testing and certication system for leather and leather goods at all production levels, including accessory materials."
More information can be found on the OEKO-TEX Leather website.
FY20 FY21 FY22 % Increase in OEKO-TEX Certications for Costco products28% 12% 37% 3 Packaging of Products & Packaging Used in Our Warehouses The labels and packaging of Costco items are tested for COCs as follows: Packaging of products that are part of the Costco Smart Screening Program use the AFIRM Group packaging mat erial RSL.
"Examples of packaging components include paper, wood, cartons, stickers, plastic wrap, nishing dyes, inks, coatings, metal, tape, textiles and desiccants."
More information can be found on the AFIRM website .
Many product categories that are tested but do not use Costco Smart Screening have their packaging tested by a third-party lab to meet U.
S. Toxics in Packaging Clearinghouse and EU heavy metal testing requirements.
Suppliers producing packaging for Kirkland Signature items must comply with the Costco RSL based on the AFIRM Packaging RSL.
The supplier will have items selected to be audited with Costco Smart Screening testing.
See the Costco Packaging Reference Chemical List in the Costco Restricted Substance Lists section below.
"Food contact packaging materials used in the Costco meat department, bakery, deli and food court are tested in the Costco Smart Screening Program."
"Examples of packaging include meat trays, bakery containers, deli tins and pizza boxes."
"For more about Costco packaging, see the Packaging page in our Merchandising section."
"Cleaning & Beauty Aid Formulated Products Suppliers are encouraged to provide Costco with ingredients either on the packaging, on their website or with a third-party chemical management tool."
Costco works with third-party platforms to gather bills of substances (BOS).
These platforms allow Costco and its suppliers to better understand the chemicals used in products.
"Costco tests for COCs using Costco Smart Screening on Kirkland Signature cleaning, health and beauty formulated products."
"Costco recognizes and accepts certain third-party certications into its Smart Screening program, which aim to provide safe, traceable and sustainable products."
An example of a third-party certier for formulated products would be Safer Choice.
The U.
"S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the Safer Choice label to identify products made with safer ingredients for the health of families, pets, workplaces and the environment."
Safer Choice-certied products have been carefully evaluated by EPA scientists.
4 Measuring Chemicals in Products & PackagingCostco measures suppliers compliance with our policies by testing products for COCs using multi-RSLs depending on product or article material.
"Currently we are screening many of our products and their packaging, following our risk-based approach in our product category selection process."
See product types listed in the Chemical Testing & The Costco Smart Screening Program section above.
"When a COC is identied in a product or packaging, the information is provided to the suppliers."
Suppliers then work on corrective action plans by item.
We also provide suppliers with report cards summarizing four years of testing for all products of the supplier that have been screened.
These allow suppliers to investigate their supply chains across their operations.
Costco shares industry resources with our suppliers via the Costco Smart Screening Guide to help them navigate their chemical management.
The number of our Smart Screening reports has increased over the past four years.
"In 2019 Costco managed 6,066 Costco Smart Screening reports."
"During FY22, there were 8,458 reports."
Summary of Costco Smart Screening Results Measure of Chemicals of ConcernFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 Costco Smart Screening r esults with NO chemicals of concern (Lab Repor t)72.5% 78.7% 81.2% 79.4% % Increase This Year vs.

"7 Updated Dec 2022Packaging Packaging is a complex aspect of our business that has many components, including concerns about plastic waste in landlls and the oceans, the need for more uniform waste collection programs, the need for better recycling infrastructure, and the inconsistency of laws and regulations."
This section explains our steps toward packaging sustainability.
"Our Packaging GoalsCostcos goal is to reduce our packaging waste by improving our eciencies, with the added benet of reducing expenses."
"We also strive to provide sustainable packaging without compromising food safety, product quality or sales while ensuring our packaging: (1) complies with laws and regulations; (2) reduces materials; and (3) communicates eectively with our members."
"To meet those goals, our packaging strategy follows these Six Rights of Packaging Sustainability which we have also shared with our suppliers at our annual Supplier Day event and in the form of Global Sustainable Packaging Guidelines."
"The Six Rights of P ackaging Sustainability The right reduction The right amount of post consumer r ecycled content (PCR) The right ber: tree-free or certied forest content The right recyclable packaging The right certied compostable packaging The right labeling In this document, you will nd more information and examples on each of these six rights."
"1 The right reductionUsing less conserves natural resources while reducing water use, greenhouse gasses and pollution."
"Our goal is to reduce the amount of packaging needed overall, without compromising product integrity, and to reduce plastic used in the packaging."
"With Costcos volumes, even the smallest reductions can create a signicant impact."
We began tracking packaging reductions several years ago and continue to seek opportunities to reduce our packaging footprint year over year.
Heres a look: 2019: 6 million pounds of plastic 2020: 8.6 million pounds of plastic 2021: 17 million pounds of plastic 2022: 6.4 million pounds of plastic FY22 Reduction Success Stories Country Description Impact (Plastic reduction in pounds) U.

"Examples include: In Canada, Leant Whey Protein Powder switched from rigid to exible packaging, reducing their plastic by over 220,000 pounds."
In the U.
"S., OXO Toilet Brush packaging redesign eliminated over 500,000 pounds of plastic."
"In South Korea, YK Feminine Hygiene packaging reduced plastic by 134,000 pounds."
"In Japan, Nano 6+ reduced their packaging plastic by 126,000 pounds."
The right amount of post consumer recycled content (PCR)Recycled content use creates needed demand for recycled materials.
Our goal is to optimize recycled content for all packaging.
"When we use recycled content in all materials, including paper, plastic, glass and metal, we support global recycling programs by creating demand for those materials."
Using recycled content may reduce energy use in the production of packaging by lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
"The procurement of raw materials has an energy footprint that can be reduced by recycling existing materials, which is less carbon-intensive."
"Additionally, recycling diverts materials from landlls, which reduces methane emissions from materials in landlls."
"In FY22, 14 million pounds of plastic recycled content was implemented and 6.7 million pounds of paper recycled content was implemented across 105 Kirkland Signature items, for a total of over 20 million pounds of recycled content."
"We continue to encourage our suppliers to incorporate recycled content to promote recycling, reduce our use of virgin materials and support the circular economy."
"3 Recycled Content Success Stories Country Description Australia Rotisserie chicken container is now 100% rPET Multiple Regions Kirkland Signature Tempura Shrimp packaging has 80% recycled content in the carton Multiple Regions Kirkland Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil has 50% rPET in the bottles Canada Multiple fresh meat corrugat ed cases contain 30% PCR C anada Kirkland Signature Fabric Softener Dryer Sheet boxes are 100% PCR Multiple Regions Kirkland Signature Dog Biscuits box contains 35% PCR Canada Kirkland Signature Organic Lemonade and Cranberry Juice bottles contain over 95% PCR Canada Four Kirkland Signature skincare products contain 75% rPET (Kirkland Signature by Borghese Intensive Eye Serum, Face Serum, Lotion w/SPF15, and Night Cream) The list above represents a small sample of the many packaging components that now contain recycled content."
"Additionally, we continue to support previously reported recycled content accomplishments from years past, such as Ecommerce shipping boxes, Food Court pizza boxes and multiple beverage containers."
"Over the past several years, we have incorporated recycled content1 in all materials, paper, metal, plastic and glass, in over 350 Kirkland Signature product packages."
"1Based on supplier reported data 4 The right ber: tree-free or certied forest productResponsible forestry supports biodiversity and carbon sequestration, and water and air quality."
"We believe that our most impactful rst steps to help support good forest stewardship practices and to protect forests are to (1) source our wood, paper and ber-based products from responsibly managed and certied forests; and (2) use recycled content and/or alternative bers when feasible."
"Costco currently accepts forest management certications from three leading organizations: Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certication (PEFC), with a preference for FSC."
More information about Costcos deforestation goals can be found on the Environmental Impacts & Land Stewardship page in our Merchandising section .
The right recyclable packagingRecycling conserves natural resources and reduces pollution.
Using r ecyclable packaging is critical to creating a supply of recycled materials.
"Recycling promotes a circular process where materials can be used more than once before reaching the end of life, which helps preserve natural resources."
"To be considered recyclable, various rules, regulations and guidelines require that the product be widely recyclable, meaning at least 50% (or more depending upon the geographic area) of the population has access to recycle the packaging."
"Widely recyclable packaging is dependent upon the availability of needed materials from recycling streams, which are inconsistent."
This underscores the need for a multifaceted approach to recyclability.
"Costco relies on the support of many organizations that provide guidance in recyclability, have labeling programs, evaluate materials, support local programs and provide insight into upcoming solutions, regulations and opportunities to collaborate."
5 Member Organizations PAC Global The right certied compostable packagingComposting puts valuable nutrients back into our soils.
Compostable packaging oers an option for packaging that cant easily be recycled.
A successful compostable packaging program relies on access to industrial composting ser vices.
"In the F ood Courts of our warehouses wher e those ser vices are available, were transitioning to compostable food service packaging in phases as we seek to learn the most eective options while responding to member feedback."
We continue to make progress in our Food Court packaging globally and actively seek solutions for the remaining food service items to help reduce single-use plastic.
The right labelingLabeling facilitates proper sortation and reduces contamination of the recycling stream.
"We want our members t o know how t o properly recycle, compost or dispose of packaging."
"If appropriate or legally mandated, we also want to communicate recycled content used in the packaging materials."
"6 Costco utilizes many dierent labeling schemes worldwide, in our initiative to label our Kirkland Signature packaging with the appropriate regional guidance."
It is our intent to label all of our private-label consumer packaging with the proper recycling information.
This past year we have increased our How2Recycle labeling to over 20% of our U.
S. Kirkland Signature items and some Canadian items.
We now have over 350 products labeled with the How2Recycle system.
"We continue to aggressively expand our labeling eorts in all of our regions, engaging in material evaluations and local regulatory requirements to better understand the global dierences in recycle collection, and how best to serve our members."
Data Collection of Packaging Information Costco has developed a packaging data collection survey to identify and account for the specic materials used in all packaging components for our Kirkland Signature products.
Suppliers are assisting us in collecting this information for the purposes of developing comprehensive strategies and to identify areas of improvement.
UMaterial HealthMaterial health in packaging is reviewed by our Quality Assurance department.
"For detailed information on our testing and screening process, see the Chemical Management page in our Merchandising section."
"FAQs & Ar chived ReportsFor more information, please review our P ackaging FAQs ."
"Please see below for archived reports: Reduction Ar chives | 2019-2021 Recycled Cont ent Archives | 2019-2021 Recyclability/Compostability Ar chives | 2019-2021 7 pdated ec 2022DKirkland Signature While a majority of our merchandise is branded, Costcos line of exclusive private-label products called Kirkland Signature continues to grow and expand."
Kirkland Signature has grown into a global brand with over $ 75 billion in sales in scal year 2022.
The Kirkland Signature ConceptCostcos mission is to continually provide our members with the best quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices.
"With Kirkland Signature, were able to meet that mission in an exciting range of products."
"Were also able to focus on our sustainability goals with these products because in developing them we have better control over the entire supply chain, including where the product comes from, environmental impacts, labor conditions, packaging and under what conditions it is produced."
Our goals for Kirkland Signature items are that they: Provide our members with high-quality products at the lowest possible price.
Are r espectful of the people or animals who produce them.
"Are respectful of the environment in the way they are produced, grown, harvested, processed, transported and packaged."
"Our buyers work with our suppliers to continually improve our sourcing pr actices t o enhance the quality and value of Kirkland Signature products, expand traceability, provide a fair return to people in the supply chain, and facilitate access to global or regional markets."
1 TraceabilityTraceability is important for several key reasons.
"It enables Costco to know the quality and safety of the product; examine issues related to environmental impacts; list product origin information on the label; and help people in the supply chain receive a fair return, so that the product can succeed in the long term."
"Materiality AssessmentCostco worked with V erisk Maplecroft to provide an independent, comprehensive and data-led view of sustainability challenges across a broad range of agricultural raw materials, with a focus on our Kirkland Signature products."
This review enables us to make evidence-led decisions to help prioritize sustainability strategy and risk mitigation eorts.
Indices reviewed included: Environmental .
"GHG int ensity, wat er stress, deforestation, climate change vulnerability, biodiversity and protected areas."
Social .
"Child labor, forced labor, gender inequality, decent wages, modern slavery and indigenous peoples rights."
Governance .
Corruption and government stability.
"Fair ReturnA fair r eturn in the supply chain is impor tant for Costco to be successful, its suppliers must thrive."
This commitment helps to ensur e long-t erm supply and quality while also using market-based approaches to address poverty and malnutrition.
Costco believes a fair return is more than the price paid for the item.
"It includes programs that (1) support producers (i.e., ranchers, farmers, growers/workers) and their communities through training for higher yields, quality and adaptation to climate change and extreme weather events; (2) pay premiums for high-quality products; and (3) improve access to health care, education, housing, clean water and nutritious food for farmers/workers and their communities."
Continuous ImprovementWe're working toward these goals one item at a time.
"Though there is still a way to go in certain areas t o meet them, we ar e also encouraged by stories of success in the Kirkland Signature items to date."
You can see several examples under Commodities & More on our Merchandising page .
"2 Innovation & Kirkland Signature In order to secure long term-supply, ensure quality products, create eciencies and eliminate unnecessary costs, Costco has been exploring vertical integration and in-country processing of some key Kirkland Signature items."
"Vertical Integration and Poultry Production To meet growing member demands for our Kirkland Signature Rotisserie Chicken and fresh chicken in the meat case, Costco has a new, vertically integrated facility in Fremont, Nebraska."
"It is operated by Lincoln Premium Poultry (LPP), a Costco aliate with poultry experience."
"In creating the chicken complex, Costco and LPP set out to build a vertically integrated facility that: Incorporates state-of-the-ar t equipment and design in its buildings."
Pr ovides signicant economic benet to the local community and farmers.
Tr eats the chickens in accordance with the highest animal welfare standards.
Is environmentally responsible.
Provides our members with the highest quality product at the lowest possible price.
3 The Processing Facility .
"The chicken complex is located on approximately 430 acres and includes a feed mill, hatchery, processing plant and testing laboratory."
"The facilities are designed to conserve water, prevent runo and treat the water before returning to the watershed."
More information about water usage can be found on the Managing Water page in our Operations section .
Facility Employees.
"The complex employs approximately 1,100 people."
"Besides paying good wages and providing competitive benets such as health care, 401(k) retirement opportunities, and paid vacation and sick leave, the plant is subject to audits conducted by an independent third party auditor to ensure it is in compliance with the same Costco Supplier Code of Conduct that other Costco suppliers worldwide abide by."
More information about our Supplier Code of Conduct can be found on the Human Rights page in our People & Communities section .
Local Farmers and Growers.
The complex relies on the support of more than 77 local farmers to grow the chickens required for the successful operation of the complex.
"Key features of this arrangement include: Gr owers receive a 15-year GIPSA contract (USDA Grain Inspection, Pack ers and S tockyards Administration), with a guaranteed base pay and the ability to earn a bonus."
The state-of-the-art barns and equipment are built according to Costco/LPP specications and are grower-owned and/or operated.
"LPP provides growers with the chicks, feed (see below), a feed management plan, t echnical e xpertise and veterinary services."
Grower contracts allow for peer review for grower improvement programs and to resolve disputes.
"Growers will be subject to strict animal welfare procedures audited by independent third party auditors, and biosecurity measures approved and monitored by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture."
More information can be found on the Animal Welfare page in our Merchandising section .
Local Grain.
"The feed mill sour ces corn and soybeans fr om local farmers, which adds another economic benet to the region surrounding the chicken complex."
"4 These grains are used to provide nutritious feed for the growers at no additional cost, as feed is included in the grower contracts."
"For more information, here is a video from a local grower ."
"The Canadian Commissary Costco operates a 93,700-square-foot state-of-the-art facility in Vaughan, Ontario, to produce frozen baked goods that are shipped to U."
"S., Canadian and Mexican warehouses."
The facility features four production lines that produce only eight items for the greatest eciency.
"Focusing on producing our high-volume items for Costco Bakeries, while controlling costs and maintaining the highest quality of ingredients, allows us to lower the cost to our members."
The commissary has been able to achieve just over 3% waste from all lines.
"This waste is then shipped o-site and converted into animal feed, which reduces the waste leaving the facility to a minimum."
Utilizing bulk ingredient delivery systems also keeps the packaging of plastic and cardboard to a minimum.
"In-Country Production In order to reduce ocean freight and transportation emissions, lower costs while retaining product quality, and increase the shelf life of food items, Costco is now exploring in-country production of some of its high volume Kirkland Signature items."
Some examples include: Kirkland Signature Bath T issue is now pr oduced in nine regions.
Kirkland Signature Bottled Water is now produced in eight regions.
Kirkland Signature Roasted Cashews and Mixed Nuts are now produced in two regions.
Reducing F ood WasteW e continually search for creative opportunities to reduce food waste when producing Kirkland Signatur e it ems.
Examples follow on the next page.
"5 Food Waste Reduction Examples For tilapia items, to ensure a product with a more uniform thickness and a more consistent cooking experience Costco uses only the top loin for its frozen Kirkland Signature Tilapia Loins."
"However, this process left the thinner bottom loin of the tilapia as potential waste."
Costco has worked with several frozen sh suppliers such as Trident and High Liner Foods to nd a solution.
The result is frozen tilapia items found in Costcos freezer section such as High Liner Tortilla Crusted Tilapia and Trident Seafoods Panko Breaded Tilapia.
Unused cashews from our whole nut program are used in other Kirkland Signature products such as our Kirkland Signature Cashew Clusters and Kirkland Signature Protein Bars.
"6 Updated Dec 2022 Coee & Cocoa Kirkland Signature CocoaThe majority of Kirkland Signature chocolate products are made from cocoa sour ced through sustainable programs, some of which are from Costcos Sassandra Cocoa program, sourcing cocoa from Cote dIvoire."

Cocoa & Child Labor Issues Costco supports eorts to eliminate deforestation in cocoa production.
We are aware that Cote dIvoire has lost 80% of its forests in the past 50 years and that cocoa production is one of the drivers of that loss.
"We are funding the distribution and replanting of trees to facilitate reforestation and agroforestry eorts, for a total of 219,000 trees to date."
Cocoa & De- forestationCostco is dedicated to pr eventing and r emediating child labor wherever it is found.
"Unfortunately, child labor is a long-term syst emic issue in cocoa supply chains."
"F or full details on child labor monitoring and remediation programs in Cote dIvoire, see Priority Industries for Strategic Collaboration in the Human Rights section on our People & Communities page ."
2 U DOur goal is for 100% of cocoa farmers in the program in Cote dIvoire to have their farms GPS polygon mapped for monitoring.
"This is done to ensure the farms are not located in protected forests, and to help preserve these forests from any further encroachment."
"As of June 2022, 100% of farmers are registered and 91% of the farms have been polygon mapped."
"More details on the Sassandra Program can be found in the Cote dIvoire Report and the Costco Connection article, Cocoa Channels ."

Kirkland Signature CashewsSome Kirkland Signature cashew products are sourced from small-scale farmers in Cot e dIvoire and Vietnam.
Supporting these farmers is the right thing to do and is key for us to continue being able to supply these premium-quality cashews in the future.
"For this reason, in 2018 we launched a cashew sustainability program by partnering with o (formerly Olam Food Ingredients)."
"The program started in Vietnam and has since been expanded to include Cote dIvoire, with the aim of improving the livelihoods of thousands of farmers, their families and local communities through a variety of steps."
Heres a look.
"Project 99, Cote dIvoireProject 99 in Cote dIvoire is designed to create a responsible cashew supply chain where smallholder farmers and their households have improved livelihoods, good health and well-being."
The program has four components: Promoting beekeeping: Women cashew farmers are being trained in beekeeping to pr ovide an additional source of income from the sale of honey.
They have been trained for more than six months through three training modules in keeping with bees natural calendar.
"Additionally, beehives have been distributed to the communities in Gbeke, Hambol, Bere and Woroba areas."
Improving community access to clean and safe drinking water: Project 99 installed 10 water pumps t o expand access to potable water.
"This beneted people across 10 villages, and four out of those 10 water pumps are working with solar energy."
"Providing childcare services in processing facilities: In February 2022, Pr oject 99 inaugurated its daycare near the Abidjan processing facility."
This has enabled nursing mothers and mothers of small children to continue to work and earn for their families while taking care of their children.

2 Kirkland Signature Soy-Based OilsCostco understands that soy is a major driver of tropical deforestation in countries such as Brazil.
"For that reason and others, we source Kirkland Signatur e Soybean Oil and Kirkland Signatur e Vegetable Oil made from soybean oil from the U."
S. and Canada.
Kirkland Signature HoneyThe honeybee population is facing multiple health threats.
"Honeybees are necessary for the pollination of appro ximat ely one-third of food consumed, including fruit, nuts and vegetables."
"Since 2012, we have invested over $7 million in honeybee health by contributing a portion of the sales of Kirkland Signature Honey items to the nonprot honeybee research organization Project Apis m ."
(PAm).
The projects that Costco supports continue to expand.
"Here are some highlights with progress updates: Long-Term Stock Improvement, which includes breeding and developing varr oa-r esistant bees for a sustainable, chemical-free varroa control option and maintaining a functioning and sustainable genetic repository for honeybee germplasm to safeguard the genetic integrity and diversity of honeybees against future health threats."
"More information can be found here, The Hilo Bee Project & Varroa Resistant Bee video ."
Apiculture T echnology T ransfer Teams give U.
"S. beekeepers technical support in the eld, survey honeybee health and educate beekeepers about best management practices."
"These teams save beekeepers money, prevent losses and help to keep a nger on the pulse of bee health nationwide."

Kirkland Signature Black PepperKirkland Signature Black Pepper is one of our items that shows continuous improvement in both sourcing and packaging.
"The pepper we use is sourced from Vietnam, including from farmers in the Quang Tri Province."
"To learn more about how these Quang Tri Province farmers' livelihoods are improving, please read the Costco Connection article, Pepper for prosperity ."
The packaging has evolved over time to become more sustainable as follows: The top of the pepper grinder is r emovable to allow the grinder to be r elled and reused.
The clear jar is now composed of 50% r ecycled PET and is r ecyclable.
"Additional shrink wrap lm has been removed from the display tray, which reduces the amount of overall plastic packaging."
"5pdated ec 2022 Organics, Greenhouse Grown & Horticulture OrganicsOrganic farming contributes to healthy land stewardship."
Costco's selection of organic products continues to grow to meet our members' demands.
Organic comprises 35% of our produce sales in the U.
S.
"Examples of organic products include fruit, vegetables, meat, eggs, cheese, milk, butter, grains, nuts, coee, tea, juice, wine, beer, spices, oils, sauces, snacks and cotton."
Some are local to the individual geographic region and others are oered worldwide.
We have many excellent suppliers who help us grow and expand our organic oerings.
"These suppliers use eld practices that support soil health, promote natural pest management and weed control, and improve food safety."
"Where it makes sense, we work with suppliers and growers to support the conversion of conventional supplies to organic."
"A key component of the sustainable growth of protein organics, such as eggs, chicken, beef, pork, etc., is organic feed."
"Costco works with its suppliers and their feed suppliers to learn the impact that this growing demand for feed has on farmers' future security, yields and income."
Green- house GrownGr eenhouses are a form of sustainable agriculture that we continue to explore with our suppliers.
"We have worked closely with numerous suppliers to increase the amount of greenhouse-grown produce we source, and we plan to continue with this strategy."
"Greenhouse-grown agriculture oers many benets, including less water and chemicals used and more productivity per acre."
"Greenhouses can also be strategically located, resulting in fewer transportation miles and fresher products."
"1 Horti- cultureIn sourcing Costcos live goods (indoor and outdoor plants) and fresh owers, we are mindful of the ecosystem impact of horticulture."
"Consistent with our sustainability principles, we look for opportunities to promote more sustainable practices including limiting the use of chemicals, promoting pollinator health and ensuring decent and safe working conditions for those in the industry."
"For example, many of our cut rose heads are sourced from Rainforest Alliance certied farms in Colombia and Ecuador, which provide traceability back to the farm and ensures specic standards are met."
"Additionally, many of these rose suppliers support their local communities through scholarship programs and childcare centers."
"Rainforest Alliance Goals Address human rights abuses like child and forced labor, low wages, poor working conditions, and gender inequality Promote more sustainable land management practices to protect forests, biodiversity, and natural resources Train farmers to grow better crops using climate-smart agriculture, which help them mitigate and adapt to climate impacts Contribute to lifting rural people out of poverty by improving sustainable livelihood opportunities for farmers, workers, and their families For more information about our Pollinator Health programs, see the Environmental Impacts & Land Stewardship page in our Merchandising section ."
"Supplier Spotlight: MM Flowers & VP Group In scal year (FY) 2022, Costco UK continued to source owers from Kenya through our supplier , MM Flowers."
MM Flowers sources our roses from farms near Mount K enya and Lake Naivasha.
"These farms are part of VP Group in Kenya, a oriculture group focused on sustainability across its farms."
They take on initiatives ranging from oering free nutritious lunches for all employees to having dedicated committees for issues such as worker welfare and gender.
"VP Group also focuses on community eorts such as providing potable water to the local community, donating to support community policing, and maintaining roads to improve local transport."
"2 Updated Dec 2022 Protein & Plant-Based Alternatives Sustainable Beef ProductionCostco recognizes that beef production has an impact on the environment and, depending upon the practices employed, the impact may be negative, positive or somewhere in between."
Costco encourages suppliers to support good land stewardship practices.
"In response to concerns that beef production contributes to tropical deforestation in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Paraguay, our intent is not to source beef from high-risk deforestation regions until comprehensive traceability and monitoring systems are in place."
"We have notied suppliers that Kirkland Signature items containing beef, including beef sold in our fresh meat cases, should not come from these regions."
"We engage with our buyers and suppliers to conrm compliance, and did not nd beef from those countries of concern in scal year (FY) 2022."
"According to supplier reports for FY22, over 88% of the beef in Kirkland Signature items came from the U."
"S., Canada and New Zealand."
Costco is a member of the U.
"S. and Canadian Roundtables for Sustainable Beef, with a mission to advance, support and communicate continuous improvement in the sustainability of U."
S. and Canadian beef production by educating and engaging the beef value chain through a collaborative multi-stakeholder eort.
These organizations facilitate the system-level change that is needed to address many of our environmental concerns.
"Costco, in partnership with others in the U."
"S., is exploring how we can suppor t ranchers to evaluate their management practices with key indicators linked to economic, social, livestock and environmental outcomes."
1 Beef and Preserving Native Grasslands Costco recognizes that one of the greatest threats to native grasslands or prairies is conversion to cropland.
We also recognize that responsible beef production can be linked to the preservation of native grasslands in places like the Northern Great Plains (NGP) of the U.
"S., where the intact grasslands ecosystem is compatible with responsible cattle grazing."
"Responsible grazing maintains the health of grasslands, improves soil quality with manure, and preserves open space and wildlife habitat."
"Additionally, carbon is sequestered in the grasses and soils of grazing lands that are properly managed."
Beef production also provides social benets by sustaining livelihoods and community vibrancy in rural areas where grasslands dominate.
"Keeping the NGP as grasslands not only helps conserve biodiversity, but it also means cleaner streams, less fertilizer runo, more pollinators for plants and more carbon stored in the soil."
Plant- Based AlternativesCostco is aware of the need for protein diversication as an additional way to address deforestation and climate change.
We will continue to oer a selection of plant-based proteins as alternative protein oerings to our members.
Some examples include plant-based burger patties from companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.
2 Updated Dec 2022Seafood & Aquaculture Seafood is an essential food for people around the world.
"With growing global demand, and limited resources available, we want to ensure were sourcing seafood in a responsible and sustainable manner."
"OverviewAt Costco, we have three primary objectives when it comes to seafood sourcing: Continuously impr ove the sustainability of our seafood from either wild sheries or farmed aquaculture in ways that enable us to meet curr ent demands without compromising the availability of future resources."
"Ensure the human rights, safety and dignity of the people who produce, process and harvest the products we sell."
"Protect our marine, coastal and freshwater ecosystems and limit the environmental impact associated with aquaculture and shing practices."
We believe products certied by Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and Aquaculture Stewar dship Council (ASC) align with many of our sourcing objectives.
We are continuing to increase the volume of MSC- and ASC-sourced seafood items we sell globally.
"We also support Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs) and Aquaculture Improvement Projects (AIPs), which help to meet MSC and ASC standards, respectively."
"Costco aims not to sell any seafood species, either branded and Kirkland Signature, that are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) endangered or critically endangered lists and/or CITES Appendix I or II, unless sourced from MSC sheries."
1 We reevaluate these policies annually and work closely with our suppliers to evaluate compliance.
"This includes our annual global supplier seafood survey, which helps us capture key information such as species, catch/farm locations, catch/farm methods and eco-certications."
We are also working on traceability initiatives to ensure we can understand the connection between the seafood we oer our members and the people and places that help produce it.
"*According to supplier reports Sourcing Practices: Wild SpeciesF or scal year (FY) 2022, 63.5% of our wild seafood is from a FIP or MSC-certied sheries."
"For wild species, we rely on the MSC certication process to ensur e we ar e sourcing responsibly with regards to select species."
"For any product to be considered MSC certied, the seafood must be shed: From sustainable sh stocks."
There ar e enough sh left in the sea t o reproduce indenitely.
With minimal environmental impact.
"Fishing operations must maintain the structure, productivity, function and diversity of the marine ecosystem."
By a shery with eective management in place.
Fisheries must comply with relevant laws and have a management system that allows it to respond quickly to changes in the status quo.
"A Note on W ild King SalmonUntil fur ther notice, weve committed to not sell wild King salmon (also known as Chinook salmon) sourced from the Salish Sea (formerly known as P uget Sound), due t o documented concerns related to its decline."
"2 Restricted Wild Species We do not sell certain wild species that have been identied at great risk, unless sourced* from MSC sheries."
"Currently, those species are: Atlantic cod Atlantic halibut Chilean sea bass Greenland halibut Grouper (Epinephelus morio) Redsh (sourced outside of U."
S.
Fisheries) Shark Skates and rays Swordsh (sourced outside of U.
S.
"Fisheries) Bluen tuna *According to supplier reports Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs)To support sheries in meeting the MSCs standards, Costco is involved in a number of Fishery Improvement Projects ."
These projects are alliances of stakeholders who work together to resolve aspects of the shery that do not meet the MSC standard.
"Our involvement includes participation in FIP meetings, letters to governments and/or sheries participants and nancial contributions."
We require FIPs to be veried and monitored as credible by publicly reporting on FisheryProgress.org .
"From 2016 to 2022, Costco contributed $530,000 to support Fishery Impr ovement Projects (FIPs)."
Costco works directly with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to support the following FIPs: Spiny Lobster - Honduras (For more information ) Spiny L obster - Nicaragua - Entered MSC full assessment process in September 2022 Spiny L obster - Brazil Spiny L obster - Belize Mahi Mahi - Ecuador Mahi Mahi - P eru Mahi Mahi - T aiwan Mahi Mahi and Y ellown Tuna - Costa Rica T una and Swordsh - Sri Lanka Cor vina - Suriname Costco and its suppliers also purchase products from these FIP sheries.
"Over time our sour cing from individual FIPs will vary, depending on market conditions and other factors."
3 Fishery Success Stories Nicaragua Spiny Lobster Trap FIP Nicaragua is the eighth largest lobster producer in the world and the largest in Central America.
"More than 95% of Nicaraguas lobster is exported, mostly to the U."
"S. Critical issues that faced the shery before the FIP was developed in 2012 included lack of new or improved data on stock status, bycatch and habitat impacts from lobster traps."
Costco has been an industry leader in supporting the Nicaragua spiny lobster trap FIP since 2016.
"With support from Costco and others, as well as strong engagement from the Nicaraguan governments sheries agency, INPESCA, the FIP is now complete."
"The shery entered the MSC full assessment process in September 2022 to achieve certication, and results on whether the shery will be certied will be determined by early 2024 ."
"Peru Mahi Mahi Longline FIP Perus mahi mahi shery supports over 10,000 shers and serves as a key link in the marine food chain, providing sustenance for sharks, dolphins, and other ocean predators."
"Peru is also a leading source of the worlds mahi mahi and, like Ecuador, a top exporter to the U."
"S. Critical issues challenging this shery include the high number of unlicensed vessels in the shery, and lack of eective national and international management of mahi mahi, a highly migratory species."
The shery also needs additional data on how shing interacts with other species including endangered sea turtles and sharks.
Costco has been a nancial supporter of the Peru mahi mahi longline FIP since 2015.
"As part of this suppor t, Costco has worked with its suppliers to encourage the Peruvian and Ecuadorian governments to agree to joint management measures for mahi mahi."
"Key projects the FIP is implementing include working with the Peru Mahi Alliance, a group of 15 Peruvian mahi mahi companies who are committed to advancing the FIP, and IMARPE (the Peruvian Institute of the Sea) to scale up implementation of an electronic monitoring and catch documentation system and improve mahi mahi research as well as complying with the new FisheryProgress.org social policy which includes making shers aware of their rights and signing a human rights code of conduct."
"4 Canned TunaSuppliers of Kirkland Signature Albacore Canned Tuna are participants in the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF), which is undertaking science-based initiatives for the long-term conservation and sustainable use of tuna stocks, reducing bycatch and promoting ecosystem health."
Each participating company is audited by a third party for compliance with ISSF conservation measures.
"Also, Costco is a founding member of the Seafood T ask Force (STF; see details below under Farmed Shrimp)."
All of our canned tuna suppliers are members.
We review the product traceability and mapping to vessels of our Kirkland Signature canned tuna supply chains.

"Sourcing P ractices: AquacultureFor FY22, 44% of our farmed seafood is sourced from ASC certied farms, or is ASC cer tied."
"We believe that farmed seafood should be an integral part of our business, that aquaculture is a critical source of aordable protein now and in the future, and that farming can be done in a responsible manner with reduced impacts on the environment and local communities."
"In our sourcing, we work closely with organizations committed to sustainable practices in aquaculture."
These include: Aquaculture S tewardship Council (ASC) : This organization sets a comprehensive list of requirements that must be met for suppliers to gain certication.
"These include water quality, responsible sourcing of feed, disease prevention, animal welfare, fair treatment and pay for workers and more."
"ASC represents the most robust, credible aquaculture global standard."
"5 Aquaculture Improvement Projects (AIPs) : Like a Fishery Improvement Project described above regarding wild species, an Aquaculture Improvement Project helps producers improve their operations and meet ASC standards."
"In support of this approach, from 2016 to 2022 Costco has contributed $330,000 to WWF to support and implement AIPs."
F Farmed Shrimparmed Shrimp Costco has been an active par ticipant in implementing the ASC shrimp standards.
These standards help to minimize key negative environmental and social impacts of shrimp farming.
Our goal is to source farmed shrimp from farms and suppliers that have been certied to ASC standards.
This goal has been partially achieved and we are actively engaging to transition more shrimp farms to reach the ASC standard by working with our suppliers and the World Wildlife Fund to develop and implement AIPs.
"More information about Costcos shrimp sourcing, can be found in our July 2020 Costco Connection article, No small feat ."
Here's a look at our sourcing policies related to popular seafood we oer at Costco.
The Seafood Task Force A key organization regarding the sourcing of farmed shrimp is the Seafood Task Force.
"The organization works to drive greater business condence for global seafood buyers purchasing from Asia by tackling illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) shing; establishing supply chain oversight from vessel to plate; mitigating risk; assuring traceability; and improving social and environmental performance, step by step."
More information on the STF and recent developments in Thailand can be found in the following links: Seafood Task Force Action Plan Public Support for Thai Government Fishery Reforms Fisheries Reforms that has resulted in a Green Card from the EU Securing Labor Rights through Social Compliance 6 Farmed Salmon Costco does not intend to sell genetically modied salmon.
Our goal is to source farmed salmon from farms and suppliers that have been certied to the ASC standard.
"This goal has been partially achieved, and we are actively engaging to transition more salmon farms to reach the ASC standard."
Our approach is to work with our suppliers and the World Wildlife Fund to support a path to ASC certication.
"In Chile, improvements have focused on key issues such as empowering local communities in salmon farming areas to better engage with companies on issues that impact them."
Global Salmon Initiative (GSI) Many of our farmed salmon suppliers have joined the Global Salmon Initiative (GSI) and launched a commitment to reaching 100% ASC certication.
"In alignment with ASC indicators, GSI eorts focus on reducing the use of antibiotics and pesticides, and avoiding wildlife interactions and escape events."
"The group also works to catalyze progress toward continuous improvements in responsible sourcing of feed ingredients, including the reduction of the use of shmeal and sh oil, plus commitments toward deforestation-free terrestrial feed ingredients."
Learn more about GSIs progress toward ASC certication in its Sustainability Report .
Farmed Pangasius We are working with our suppliers on implementing the ASC Pangasius Standard.
Our goal is to source pangasius from ASC certied farms and suppliers.
Farmed Tilapia Costcos intent is t o only sell tilapia fr om farms and suppliers that are ASC certied.
Costco encourages suppliers to work toward ASC certication.
"Additional information about Costcos farmed tilapia practices can be found in our August 2016 Costco Connection article, Tilapia royalty ."
7 U DASC Feed StandardWe understand that aquaculture feed has an impact on wild sheries and on feed ingredients sourced on land.
"We support the ASC Feed Standard, which denes requirements for responsible factory practices and marine and terrestrial ingredients in ASC-certied aquaculture feed, including soy and shmeal/oil."
The ASC Feed Standard requires feed mills to source from more sustainable sheries over time.
"Mills will have to record and repor t all ingr edients that make up over 1% of a feed, and will need to take steps to ensure they have been sourced from supply chains with low risk for illegal deforestation."
"Additionally, they will have to assess the risk of high-risk and high-volume ingredients that contribute to deforestation or land conversion, and must commit and report publicly to transitioning to a supply chain free from these key negative impacts."
This mechanism is based on internationally recognized steps by the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi) to work toward ethical supply chains.
More information about ASCs aquaculture feed standards can be found on its website .
"8 pdated ec 2022 Cotton and textiles are an integral part of Costcos business, particularly within our apparel and home textiles oerings."
"We recognize some of the challenges in textile production (e.g., forced labor issues in cotton, environmental issues with producing synthetic fabrics) and as a result, we have focused on eorts to trace our cotton sources and ensure our items containing recycled textiles are certied to specic global standards."
Cotton Sourcing and Traceability Organic CottonCostco began a cotton tr aceability program in 2019 to further understand where the cott on in our Kirkland Signatur e apparel is coming from.
"In 2020, we enhanced this program to include supply chain mapping and third-party traceability document verication."
More information can be found in the Human Rights section on our People & Communities page (see Priority Industries for Strategic Collaboration.)
"In addition, our Kirkland Signature products made from Pima and / or extra-long staple length (ELS) cotton require DNA testing protocols to verify these species."
DNA testing is completed in multiple stages of the supply chain.
"For our organic cotton products, manufacturers claiming organic cotton must be certied by Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)."
"GOTS is the global industry leader in certifying textiles processing for organic bers, including cotton."
"The GOTS system certies the product throughout the entire textile supply chain, ensuring the organic status of cotton from raw materials to the end consumer."
Textiles & Cotton 1 Kirkland Signature Bed Sheets Kirkland Signature Bed Sheets are made from Pima cotton grown in the Central Valley of California.
"Through a patented technology, a program to test the traceability of cotton ber through the entire supply chain has been established."
This helps track the purity of the cotton and verify the manufacturing process from the elds to our shelves.
More information can be found in this Cotton Traceability video.
Bowles Farming Company ( Bowles Farming Company.
"One of the farms that grows extra-long staple (ELS) cotton used for our Kirkland Signature Bed Sheets is the BFCo), a family-owned and operated farm in California."
"Beyond compliance with regulatory requirements, BFCo has initiated programs and practices focused on protecting workers and the environment in the areas of soil health, climate change and water conservation."
"To learn more about these eorts, visit this article: Recycled T extilesRecycled fabric technology continues to be popular in the textile industr y, especially in light of sustainability goals across the apparel and home goods industries."
Benets of recycled textiles include lower energy usage in production and a reduction in the need for virgin materials.
"As a result, at Costco we look to source recycled textiles for our items."
"To ensure recycled textile claims are veried and validated, Costco requires one of the three approved certications: the Recycled Claim Standard (RCS), the Global Recycled Standard (GRS), or REPREVE."
"2 Updated Dec 2022Wood, Pulp & Paper Our goal is for our suppliers to create wood, paper and ber-based products with as little impact to the ecosystem as possible while still delivering the quality and price that our members demand."
"Wood ProductsAfter a 10-year moratorium on teak, in 2015 we began selling a limited amount of outdoor teak furniture that was 100% FSC-certied."
We continue to require that teak sold at Costco is FSC 100% certied.
"Costco has expanded FSC certication to other species of solid wood products, including FSC-certied cedar wood playsets, gazebos, outdoor furniture and pavilions."
"To learn more about our product t esting of furnitur e products, please visit the Chemical Management page of our Merchandising section ."
"1 Fiber-Based Packaging Kirkland Signatur e P aper-Based ProductsOur packaging goals are to reduce the amount of packaging used, while still protecting the products integrity."
"Fiber for paper-based packaging should come from known sources, should be procured legally and should not contribute to deforestation."
"Because there is a limited supply of certied ber, we highly encourage the use of recycled content whenever possible."
"In scal year (FY) 2020, all of our U."
S. ecommerce shipping boxes fullled by Costco used 100% recycled content.
"In FY21 and FY22, due to increased demand for ecommerce products and supply constraints, we had to supplement some boxes that did not utilize 100% recycled content."
More information can be found on the Packaging page of our Merchandising section .
Our goal is to have all Kirkland Signature paper products created to optimize recycled content and tree-free bers where feasible.
"Virgin-wood bers should come from certied, well-managed forests that dont contribute to deforestation or degradation."
"Costco accepts forest management certications from three leading organizations: Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)1, Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Cer tication (PEFC), with a preference for FSC."
These certications help to ensure that the needs of the forest ecosystems and their communities are balanced with conservation.
"As of FY22 and based upon the volume of ber used in our Kirkland Signature paper-based products in the chart below, 99.5% is certied to FSC, SFI and/or PEFC, according to supplier reports."
"We are working toward 100% certication that will include our Kirkland Signature Photo Paper, which represents 0.4% of this ber volume."
This item is scheduled to transition to FSC certication in 2023 as we sell through our previous inventory.
"The Kirkland Signature Gift Tissue is already using 100% recycled content, of which 50% is post consumer recycled content; we dont intend to transition to a forest certication at this time."

Costco started measuring its baseline for total waste emissions in FY21.
"Since then, we have estimated our total Scope 3 (GHG Protocol Category 5) waste emissions for all reporting Costco locations for FY20, FY21, and FY22 based upon the total tonnage to landll and total tonnage diverted."
"We reported 147,347 mtCO2e in FY20 and 147,138 mtCO2e in FY21."
"In FY22, we are reporting 154,140 mtCO2e."
"Scope 1, 2, and 3 Action Plans UPDATEDeveloped Scope 1, 2, and 3 Action Plans: We created Operations and Merchandising Action Plans to address our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions."
"This was achieved by evaluating our baseline data, assessing industry leading practices and global standards, and modeling near-term and long-term CO2e reduction opportunities within the context of SBTis Corporate Net Zero Standard."
Details on these plans and their accompanying metrics and targets can be found below.
"Engaged our Suppliers on Climate: We surveyed our top 500 suppliers to understand their CO2e emissions tracking, metrics and emissions reduction eorts."
They represent approximately 70% of annual U.
S. sales.
"Supplier Engagement UPDA TE 6 CO2e Reduction CommitmentsIn 2022, we increased our absolute Scope 1 and 2 CO2e reduction target by 19% as shown in the table below."
We plan to disclose in December 2023 an absolute Scope 3 CO2e reduction target.

"Our priority is to purchase clean energy and integrate on-site energy systems when operationally feasible; and acquire high-quality, veried renewable energy certicates (REC) after exhausting all other operationally viable reduction pathways."
We have committed to purchase 80% clean electricity by 2030.
We will source an increasing percentage of contract purchases from low carbon energy sources through 2030 (and beyond).
"Additionally, we own and operate more than 100 on-site solar systems, with the intention to expand on-site solar operations where feasible."
"Our current purchased energy mix is a combination of: Standard Delivery Renewable Energy, which will be achieved through meeting compliance with state Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) targets and an anticipated decarbonization of the electric grid."
"Green Taris , which are currently available in 15 regulated states."
"Energy Supply 7 8 Power purchase agreements (PPA), which will be actively pursued in all deregulated markets as a physically delivered purchase from a greeneld project (to claim potential additionally) integrated into our retail contracts."
"RECs with (Grid/Null/Financial) Power, which will be the nal tier(s) in the strategy and will cover all MWh that are not or cannot be managed through the previously listed three structures."
We continue to evaluate ways to reduce Scope 1 natural gas usage.
"Our options include Certied Natur al Gas, Methane P erformance Certicate, Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and Blended RNG."
"Most energy used in our warehouses is for refrigeration, HVAC, lighting, food preparation and heating water."
"We continue to build the capabilities to track compliance as well as monitor and manage natural resource consumption at our warehouses, and at the individual warehouse and aggregate levels."
Our Sustainability Technical Assistance Review (STAR) framework is another tool that helps reduce warehouse CO2e emissions.
See details on the Environmental Compliance page in our Operations section .
Our prior successes in reducing energy consumption make further reductions challenging.
"As part of our energy eciency eort, we are implementing a plan to accelerate the replacement of existing incumbent lighting and LEDs in our warehouses to more ecient LEDs with lower wattage."
"In addition to evaluating reliability-centered maintenance practices and technology upgrades, we are piloting a strategic Retrocommissioning Building Tune-Up Program across a select number of warehouses."
Through energy audits and energy eciency measures we seek to maintain energy savings and carbon reductions long-term.
"This program will be supported by a new group of Certied Energy Managers, who will be responsible for establishing and improving each warehouses energy use."
"Energy EciencyAdditional projects that are currently being piloted and / or evaluated include: LED upgrades Skylight insulation Switchgear maintenance Heat pump water heaters Electric ovens, rotisseries and scrubbers Refrigeration Fugitive emissions fr om our refrigeration systems make up around 24% of our FY21 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and represent an area of continued focus."
"The goal is t o reduce the harmful impacts from hydrouorocarbons (i.e., HFCs) and other gases from the refrigeration systems in our warehouses."
We are committed to accelerating the phase-out of HFCs and increase our investment in refrigeration retrots to reduce refrigerant emission Global Warming Potential (GWP) by 30% by 2030 as compared to our 2020 baseline.
We have: Performed 15 refrigeration retrots in order to move to lower GWP refrigerants.
Tested new state-of-the-art leak detection systems to identify refrigerant leaks and trigger alerts for faster resolution.
Collaborated with the North American Sustainable Refrigeration Council (NASRC) to engage on industry-wide challenges.
"Obtained platinum-level certication from the Environmental Protection Agencys GreenChill program for two new warehouses that opened in the fall of 2021, which is the equivalent of avoiding the annual equivalent of 2,888 Mt CO2e."
We also commit to increasing the number of CO2-based refrigeration systems in the United S tates and Canada to 50% of all new U.
S. and Canada warehouses through FY30.
"In addition, we will obtain the GreenChill platinum-level certication for all new CO2 warehouses opened in 2023 and beyond."
"9 ElectricationWe continue to explore opportunities to replace fossil fuels with electricity in our war ehouses, depots and manufacturing facilities."
"This consists of a r ange of pilot programs and analysis to identify, understand and evaluate the operational and nancial implications aligned to our broader global energy strategy."
"These pilots include but are not limited to: Evaluate electric vehicles , including piloting electric tractors, yard trucks and electric terminal tractors."
"Pilot electric equipment within our warehouses , including testing an electric bakery oven at one of our warehouses."
"Conduct electric vehicle charging tests at multiple warehouse locations , to evaluate the feasibility of installing electric vehicle charging stations for our members."
We are committed to converting all of our depot yard trucks from diesel models to alt ernative fuel models (including electric variants) by 2035.
This is dependent upon the t echnology meeting our business and operational requirements.
See the Transportation & Logistics page in our Operations section of our Sustainability Commitment for additional details on electric vehicle pilot programs and electric vehicle charging stations.
"10 Design & Site SelectionWe understand the importance of the built environment and the locations we choose to build our warehouses, depots and manufacturing facilities on our carbon footprint and the natural environment."
"Over the past year, we have evaluated and tested: Increasing the amount of recycled materials used in constructing our full metal buildings, including the use of prefabricated structural steel systems and recycled asphalt in all new parking lots."
"Optimizing the use of the green spaces at our warehouses in line with our broader sustainability commitments, including planting trees, increasing planting density and drought-tolerant species, and native and ornamental vegetation."
"We are also evaluating new technologies, such as low-carbon steel and low-carbon cement, to identify opportunities to test in new or renovated buildings."
"See the Construction, Landscaping & Preservation page in our Operations section for additional details."
"We established a new cross-functional, executive-level governance structur e for ener gy-related projects, which meet regularly to evaluate opportunities."
"We are also implementing an enterprise sustainability data management system for improved tracking, reporting and decision-making."
"We began investing in employee education and career development in 2022 on the topics of energy eciency, energy management, and data analytics."
"For example, in Q1 of 2023, we will train up to 50 employees to become Certied Energy Managers (CEMs), who will support implementation of energy-related initiatives that will help us meet our Scope 1 and 2 carbon reduction goals in partnership with the Executive Global Energy Task Force and the Energy Department."

FY22 is currently being calculated Scope 3 Action PlanWe use a holistic approach to sustainability that addresses more than climate factors within the merchandising portion of our business.
"Although climate is an important factor, we ask six comprehensive questions throughout our supply chains related to traceability, human rights, animal welfare, environment and land stewardship, climate and packaging."
Please see our Merchandising section to learn more about these six questions.
"We estimate that our FY20 Scope 3 emissions are approximately 141 million metric tons, representing around 98% of our global CO2e footprint (excluding biogenic carbon emissions)."
The gure is broken down in the following graphic.
"FY20 Baseline Scope 3 Emissions (mt Co2e) Because the majority of our carbon footprint lies within our supply chain Category 1 (Purchased Goods and Services) and Category 11 (Use of Sold Product) represent 96% of our Scope 3 emissions we are committed to working with our suppliers, other stakeholders in the supply chain, and others to reduce the supply chains overall carbon footprint."
"Our action plan consists of ve key components: traceability, supplier engagement, sourcing strategy, partnerships and pilots, and future opportunities."
We understand the need for Costco to source its items responsibly.
"To do so, we must understand where our items come from and the entities in the supply chain, back to the farm or source."
"We plan to: Map our priority commodity supply chains to understand areas of risk, including biodiversity impacts."
Conduct materiality and risk assessments for our business to prioritize our resource allocation.
Traceability 13 Build out technology infrastructure to support traceability eorts.
"Supplier EngagementIn 2022, we completed a survey of our top 500 U."
"S. suppliers to understand their actions to measure, report, set targets for, and reduce their emissions."
"Our analysis found that around 64% of our suppliers have not started taking measures towards measuring and disclosing emissions, around 19% have started collecting and disclosing their emissions, and the remaining suppliers are further along with setting targets for their emissions."
Of our top 500 U.
"S. suppliers, around 16% state they are committed to SBTi's framework and an additional 4% state they are aligned with SBTi."
"Ongoing supplier engagement eorts include: Support suppliers to advance along their sustainability maturity curves with respect to measuring, disclosing, and target-setting for their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions."
Engage suppliers to purchase more clean energy and encourage them to set clean energy purchasing goals.
"Develop supplier scorecards and item scorecards to benchmark, celebrate successes, and encourage accountability."
Engage suppliers to reduce packaging impacts and improve circularity.
"14 Sourcing StrategyWe aim to be thoughtful about how and what we source to ensure we are doing the right thing for our members, our employees, our suppliers, the environment, and the workers and communities in our supply chains."
"Three areas of focus on our sourcing strategy will include: Use CO2e emissions footprint as an input into selection of certain items (e.g., Energy STAR-certied items for Category 11)."
"Continue our commitment to eliminate deforestation in key commodities in our Kirkland Signature supply chains: palm oil, wood/pulp/paper, soy, cocoa and beef."
Continue to update our progress on our Sustainability Commitment Updates and also publicly report using CDP Forest.
"Partnerships, Pilots and Innovation EortsOther cross-value chain partnership ideas and concepts include: Pilot new t echnologies or pr ograms for regenerative agriculture to promote and scale more sustainable agriculture practices."
"Partner with suppliers, farmers, NGOs and consortiums on at-source initiatives (e.g., regenerative agriculture programs for corn and soy)."
15 Future Opportunities & ConsiderationsWe will continue to research and investigate other opportunities to impact our Scope 3 footprint.
"This will include: Account for the impact of new Science Based Target Initiative Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) target-setting guidance and GHG Protocol Land Sector and Removals guidance (expected to be released in Q2 2023)."
Assess our global water footprint across our supply chain and explore ways to optimize and reduce our water use throughout our operations and supply chain.
Identify one of our priority commodity supply chains to begin to pilot the TNFD in FY23 and report on progress in December 2024.

2 Updated Dec 2022SASB Costco follows the guidance of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards for reporting on sustainability metrics.
"Sustainability Accounting Standards BoardIn scal year (FY) 2021, we began an assessment of ESG reporting methodologies, best practices, trends and opportunities."
We determined that the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards would provide investors information pertaining to topics that are relevant to our operations.
We identied two SASB industries most relevant to our business: Food Retailers & Distributors and Multiline; and Specialty Retailers & Distributors.
A cross-functional team reviewed these SASB metrics and selected those that were relevant to our operations.
"With the assistance of third-party consultants, we conducted a data quality risk-assessment of these selected SASB metrics."
"Based upon that assessment, we identied a subset of SASB metrics for which we reported our U."

"Under the Boards direction, we have also aligned a portion of executive compensation with environmental and social priorities through our Executive Bonus Plan, which rests on quantitative metrics including diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), resource consumption and waste reduction, and emissions reduction, as well as qualitative factors."
"For FY23, this element of the plan was extended to Senior Vice Presidents and Country Managers."
"Governance 1 Governance Structure Managements role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities Costcos sustainability strategy and Climate Action Plan continues to be led by our Vice President of Global Sustainability and Compliance, who reports to the CEO and regularly engages with the Board and the Nominating & Governance Committee and Compensation Committee."
"This Vice President also serves as Chair of the newly formed ESG Executive Advisory Council, which brings together executives from across the company to set goals and strategy."
"This cross-functional approach is also carried forward by various task forces such as our newly established Global Energy Task Force (discussed in our Climate Action Plan), the Merchandising Task Force for Supplier Engagement, and ESG Reporting."
We recognize the multi-dimensional nature of ESG priorities and the need to engage leadership across departments and geographies.
"2 StrategyClimate-related risks and opportunities on business, strategy and nancial planning Climate change is impacting the world and our business, and these impacts are growing."
"In April and July 2022, our global executives conducted in-depth climate-related scenarios analysis, exploring climate-related risks and opportunities to operations, supply chain, members, employees, reputation and products."
"Using an exploratory approach, we leveraged three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes (IPCC) Sixth Assessment (2021-22), in alignment to the IPCCs temperature- based Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), we identied potential impacts under the following scenarios: a coordinated global action achieves average warming of well below 2.0C; a 2.0-3.0C warming, with a fragmented global geopolitical and commercial response to climate change; an average warming exceeding 3.0C, characterized by a reactive, sporadic global response to mitigate and adapt to the worst eects of climate change."
"From this analysis, we created an inventory of climate-related risks and opportunities related to our business."
We anticipate transitional and physical impacts from climate change and will continue to evaluate impacts on our nancial position.
Based on our current assessment we foresee our identied climate-related risks outweighing our climate-related opportunities.
"Climate-related risks and opportunities identied over the short, medium and long term In identifying our time horizons for the short, medium and long term, we consider our overall business model, identied risks and general timing of chronic climate-related impacts to be realized: Short term (1-5 Years): Generally aligned with our timeframe for internal nancial planning, budgeting and analysis."
"Medium term (5-10 Years): To capture impacts of transition activities and associated risks and some, but not all, impacts of chronic physical risks emerging in the next decade."
Long term (10-30 Years): To capture impacts of chronic physical risks that could potentially develop over time and manifest in our operations and supply chain.
3 Transition Risks Class Risk Description Time Horizon Policy & Legal Emerging emissions reporting requirements are labor intensive in our Medium-term current technology posture and could require extensive changes to processes.
Market S trategic planning may be challenging due to evolving market response to climate change.
"Medium-term Market Merchandising may become more dicult, as widely varying regulations may increase pr oduction costs throughout our supply chain, creating challenges to source products or categories at typical pricing."
Medium-term Mark et Decreased demand for gasoline due to climate change concerns and economic shifts may aect future operations and negatively impact sales and trac in our warehouses.
"Long-term Technology Emission reduction programs and initiatives may lead t o higher operating costs, prices and/or reduced margins."
"Medium-term Physical Risks Class Risk Description Time Horizon Acute Short-term Chronic Medium-term Chronic Medium-term Chronic Long-termIncreased intensity and frequency of oods, wind storms, wildres, cyclones, storm surges, hail, drought, etc."
may (1) disrupt global supply chains by decreasing the production capacity of our suppliers and/or increasing production and transportation costs and (2) have operational and/or community impacts.
"Increased or decreased levels of precipitation may cause ooding, droughts, and water shortages that could have operational and/or community impacts and/or disrupt global supply chains."
"Rising temperatures may increase energy costs, disrupt power grids and could have operational and/or community and/or global supply chain impacts."
Extreme variability in weather patterns may disrupt global supply chains by decreasing the production capacity of our suppliers and/or increasing production and transportation costs.
"4 Opportunities Class Risk Description Time Horizonime Horizonime Horizon Products & servicesShort-term Energy Source Transitioning to renewable and clean energy sources may allow Costco to decrease overall emissions, provide gr eater visibility on energy pricing, and participate in certain tax incentives in the US and elsewhere."
Medium-term Resource EciencyInitiatives to reduce Costco and customer waste may allow for participation in new revenue str eams through circular product design and decreased costs associated with disposal.
"Medium-term Resilience of strategy For each of the three scenarios analyzed, we evaluated Costcos resilience and our ability to mitigate the transition and physical risks identied and to capitalize on future opportunities."
"In all scenarios, Costcos operational strengths were identied as a core element of its resilience, including our no-frills, operations-focused warehouses and depots, which allows us to build resilience into our operations through investments in renewable and clean energy, technology and equipment."
"We identied that our global supply chain, geograph- ically diverse retail locations, and membership-based model provide risk diversication."
"Continuing to build resilience throughout our supply chain with deepened supplier relationships will be crucial to mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change, as well as capturing market-based opportunities in response to evolving member expectations and needs over time."
Please see our Sustainability Commitment and Climate Action Plan for further details on Costcos sustainability and climate strategies.
Value provided to consumers through volume purchases and ecient distribution may allow Costco t o gain market share for sustainable and low-carbon items.
5 Risk ManagementProcesses for identifying and assessing climate-related risks We have engaged third-party consultants to assist with risk assessment.
We identied and qualitatively assessed potential impact and likelihood of climate-related risks that impact the Food & Beverage and Multiline retail industries as a whole and those that may uniquely impact Costcos membership warehouse business model.
"We will continue to develop a framework to assess nancial impacts from these risks and opportunities under several climate scenarios, as described above."
Processes for managing climate-related risks We will continue to solicit input from global leaders across the company to assess climate-related risks (as well as opportunities) and generate options for managing those risks.
"These discussions inform strategy-setting by the Board, the Executive Committee and ESG Executive Advisory Council and serve as groundwork for determining climate-related initiatives."
"Climate is not a new challenge for us, though we expect to experience its impacts at a greater volatility and velocity."
We under- Stand the long-term importance of climate-related risks and oppor- tunities.
"Our aim is that our business remains responsible, resilient and relevant in accordance with our Mission Statement and Code of Ethics."
Our processes for developing remediation for risks and integrating that remediation into our operations are evolving.
"The ESG Executive Advisory Council which is supported by cross-functional operating teams will be key for identication, assessment and management of climate-related risk."
Any material climate-related risks identied will be communicated to the Executive Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors for evaluation.
"6 Metrics & TargetsMetrics to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with our strategy and risk management process, including Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions and related risks and targets to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and related performance Our Climate Action Plan features an in-depth discussion of climate-related Reduction Commitments, Metrics and Targets."
"This includes our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions."
"Costco embraces transparency in climate reporting through frameworks such as CDP, where we have regularly shared our progress for over a decade."
"Alongside our emissions reporting, we disclose a range of other metrics and targets that we have published for several years."
"These metrics represent important environmental impacts relevant to Costco and where we can make the most positive impact, even as they directly and indirectly aect Costcos total greenhouse gas emissions."
See following page for details on our metrics.
