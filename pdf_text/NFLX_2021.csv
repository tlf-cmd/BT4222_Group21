"OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND BOUNDARIES Our Carbon Footprint - In the past year, we measured our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, also known as carbon footprint, following the GHG Protocol for 20214."
"Our Independent Accountants, Ernst & Young (EY), reviewed our 2021 Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions (their report here)."
This exercise helped us understand where our largest sources of emissions lie and the biggest opportunities we have to reduce them.
"Netflixs footprint was 1.53 million metric tons (MTCO2e) in 2021, covering Scopes 1, 2, and 3."
"From 2020 to 2021, the Scope 1 footprint increased due to an increase in film and TV productions after 2020, a year where the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in delayed productions that were finished in 2021."
"We present the footprint and our target progress in three separate tables throughout this report: Table 1: 2021 Greenhouse Gas Inventory below shows our 2019, 2020, and 2021, greenhouse gas corporate inventory per the WRI/WBCSD Corporate Greenhouse Gas Accounting Protocol."
Table 2: 2021 SBT Emission Reductions Summary Table (on page16) shows our quantified reductions from the range of measures we have put in place over the past 12 months to track progress towards our science-based target5.
Table 4: 2021 Carbon Credit Portfolio (on page 20) shows the carbon credits we purchased and retired in 2021.
We reduced emissions through several measures in 2021 (e.g.
"using cleaner fuels or driving EVs instead of gas cars), and avoided future emissions by changing several areas of our operations that were dependent on fossil fuels (e.g."
using natural gas heating systems instead of all electric heat pumps).
The following table shows Netflixs annual carbon footprint totals.
We calculated these totals using market-based and location- based emissions accounting methods defined by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.
Location-based figures are calculated based on the emissions intensity of the locations where the electricity consumption occurs.
"The market-based method incorporates electricity procurement decisions that are chosen, including electricity supply from utilities and contractual instruments such as renewable energy certificates (RECs)."
4 Netflixs greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting is consistent with the operational control approach as set out by the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard: Revised Edition (2004).
"The organizational and operational boundary applies to the global company including its subsidiaries, the office and studio facilities we own and operate (e.g."
"Netflix Albuquerque Studios, USA) as well as facilities we lease from others but over which we have meaningful operational control (e.g."
corporate and studio offices and stages).
"5 There is no reporting guidance from the SBTi on tracking progress towards science based targets on an annual basis, so we use standard greenhouse gas accounting methodologies per the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol."
Our internal audit team validates our greenhouse gas accounting methodologies and we engage EY to perform limited assurance over our greenhouse gas emissions.

for our Open Connect network).

"In some cases, where data may not be available or of sufficient quality, Netflix will use proxy data, industry-average figures or rely on experts."
"In such instances, we use third-parties for reliability and completeness."
11 The boundary was established in alignment with the GHG Protocol Corporate and Scope 3 Standards.
Footprint ComponentsNetflix is an entertainment company.
"Over half of our footprint lies within the physical production of our Netflix-branded content (content), followed by our corporate operations and purchased goods (corporate), followed by our data center providers (streaming)."
"Netflixs 2021 company carbon footprint by business activity Methodology: How we calculate our footprintAll GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol (Annex A) relevant to Netflix are accounted for and converted into metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MTCO2e) as specified by the GHG Protocol (GHG Protocol, 2004)10."
DataWe keep our various data sources in different formats.
"To improve our GHG data management, we have implemented a process to collect any business activity data and continue to improve on these methods."
"There are certain categories of documents that are to be retained by specific groups within Netflix, following our Practices and Policies."
"Our Footprint Boundary Our footprint includes all Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions) as well as relevant11 Scope 3 categories, which therefore includes activities outside of our operational control."
"This means that we include all Netflix-branded content production, whether we manage the production directly (like Dont Look Up ), or through a third-party production company (like Holiday in the Wild, Our Planet, Bill Nye Saves the World , or You vs."
"Wild ) as well as all content that we license that is Netflix-branded (like The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, My Octopus Teacher , or Breaking Boundaries )."
"Activities outside of our operational control present challenges to measuring and reducing emissions, but we believe including the emissions from Netflix-branded content (wherever it is produced) will create a positive ripple effect across the industry."
"Engaging these groups requires a significant investment in collaboration across our value chain that can be resource-intensive, but we think this ultimately strengthens Netflixs business network."
STREAMING 5%CORPORATE 37% CONTENT 58%Environmental 11 Data Centers We work with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our data storage needs.
AWS has set a goal of being 100% renewable by 2025 and we work with them on measuring and reporting the emissions associated with the services they provide us.
AWS purchases and provides renewable electricity to us and provides attestations regarding their energy attributes.
"We also invest in the efficient distribution of our content through our Open Connect appliances, which we make freely available to Internet Service Providers."
"Internet Transmission & User Device Energy Use Not included in our Scope 3 boundary are emissions from the internet transmission or electronic devices our members use to watch Netflix, like an Apple tablet, Android phone, or Samsung television."
GHG accounting guidance does not yet exist for streaming companies on this topic.
"Current best practice is for the Internet Service Providers and device manufacturers to account for those emissions within their target boundaries, because they have operational control over the design and manufacturing of their equipment12."
"While these emissions dont fall within our company footprint, weve joined with other companies to measure them through DIMPACT , a collaborative research initiative."
"Led by researchers at the University of Bristol, DIMPACT created a tool to calculate the carbon footprint of streaming and other everyday internet uses, such as browsing news stories."
"Through DIMPACT, we worked with peers and academic and industry experts to commission a white paper with well-regarded think tank Carbon Trust to correct inaccurate information about streaming emissions."
Results of this study indicate that one hour of streaming in Europe emits ~55gCO2 per hour.
"To be conservative, Netflix uses its own estimate of well below 100gCO2e per hour as a ceiling value13 that encompasses TVs and other viewing devices, home routers, internet infrastructure, and data centers14."
"In comparison, the emissions from microwaving a bag of popcorn for four minutes is about 16gCO2e (also using a European average grid emission factor), while driving 100 meters in an average petrol car emits around 22gCO2e.15 The tools validation by Carbon Trust brings us closer to accurately assessing streamings impact on climate - whether its from the data centers, Internet Providers, or device manufacturers, and entertainment and media companies who rely on streaming."
"Better understanding this footprint means we can better reduce emissions across industries, countries and the world."
"12 Per the GHG Protocol, the most common method by which to allocate emissions to one company or another is called operational control method (page 18 of the Protocol)."
"13 Another highly regarded report from the IEA cites a 36gCO2 per hour figure, which is less than the Carbon Trust white paper and significantly less than Netflixs conservative estimate."
14 Location and device choices also determine the hourly footprint itself within the <100gCO2e/hour range.
The sources of the households and infrastructures electricity are the main variables.
"To be conservative, our calculations do not take account for regions where hourly emissions are lower due to partial or full renewable energy usage from the grid."
"15 Carbon Trust whitepaper, page 8."
"12Environmental The Optimize, Electrify, Decarbonize FrameworkWere encouraged by Apple, Microsoft, Sony and others commitments to tackle their devices emissions during use, and are encouraging others to follow their example."
"In 2021, we engaged 6 additional global manufacturers to raise their awareness and encourage action."
Recent efforts made by Amazon to quantify and reduce device emissions through efficiency measures and lifecycle assessments are particularly inspiring.
"And DIMPACT has expanded to include a device manufacturers working group, a response to the Carbon Trust white papers finding that viewing devices are responsible for more than 50% of the overall carbon footprint of streaming for the average consumer."
"NET ZERO16 + NATURE: PLANNING AND PROGRESS Last March, we committed to reducing our emissions in line with the latest climate science, ensuring our internal reductions align with a trajectory of no more than 1.5C of warming."
"Our main sources of internal emissions from our productions, corporate offices, travel, and streaming can be boiled down to two basic categories: fuel we burn and electricity we consume."
"This includes electricity generated by fossil fuels, as well as the direct combustion of fossil fuels to heat buildings, on-set power generators, and for transportation."
"To achieve our internal reductions, were focused on solutions most relevant to the entertainment industry Optimize, Electrify, Decarbonize strategy."
16 Guidance for corporate net zero claims is still under development and evolving rapidly.
"In 2021, the SBTi issued guidance for long-term corporate net zero, and a variety of other net zero guidance initiatives (e.g."
"SBTi, VCMI, Carbon Trust, etc) are underway but have not concluded their work."
There is no guidance yet for companies with near-term net zero targets or guidance on the use of carbon credits towards net zero claims.
We remain committed to evaluating each of the emerging standards based upon the best science available.
"Environmental 13Reducing Emissions from Electricity Use First, we optimize by focusing on energy efficiency, reducing the amount of electricity that we use in both our production work and also in our offices."
"In 2021, we conducted energy efficiency audits at select facilities to identify opportunities for energy savings through equipment upgrades and better building management practices."
"This analysis covered over 30% of our global square footage across stages, studios, and offices and identified cost-saving energy efficiency opportunities across our facilities."
"Next, we electrify the equipment that uses the most liquid fuels, like vehicles, buildings and generators."
"For instance, where we can, we use electric motors because theyre more efficient and electricity is more easily decarbonized."
"Then, for emissions sources where optimization and electrification arent possible, we decarbonize whats left by installing and purchasing renewable energy."
This means matching renewable electricity to any grid-connected power that isnt carbon-free and shifting to lower-carbon or zero-carbon fuel options when connecting to the grid isnt possible.
"We look for renewable energy options in the following order of preference: 1) onsite solar+storage, 2) utility provided green tariff programs, 3) direct investment or purchase agreements for offsite wind or solar, 4) unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates."
We dont own the majority of our office and stage space we lease them.
So were not often able to procure renewable electricity directly.
"In some countries, direct renewable electricity purchasing is not available, so we purchase renewable attribute certificates in those countries."
And we explore ways to bring new renewable electricity generation to regions we operate in by investing in new projects and products.
"Reducing Emissions from Fuel Use Fuel consumption makes up a large proportion of our Scope 1 emissions, and due to the nature of our business and operations, presents unique challenges to decarbonize."
"We follow our internal reduction framework above of Optimize, Electrify and Decarbonize to tackle these hard-to-abate emissions."
"Optimize fuel consumption : For corporate offices, this focuses mostly on efficient creation and capture of building heat, and on the production side, can range from optimizing the size of diesel generators or reducing how long vehicles idle."
"Electrify vehicles, buildings, and generators : Incorporating electric vehicles into production fleets and installing EV charging infrastructure at studios are critical to reducing emissions."
"Up to 70% of the fuel used by productions goes into vehicles, therefore electrifying a significant portion of the production fleet will be essential over the coming decade."
Decarbonize through fuel switching : We recognize that not everything can be solved with efficiency or electrification.
"For these use cases, Netflix is piloting ways to transition away from heavy emitting fossil fuels towards low and zero emissions fuels like renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and green hydrogen.14Environmental Delivering on our Science-Based Target: 2021 Progress In 2021, based on our key sources of emissions, we put together a plan and decarbonization roadmap to reduce emissions that put us on a path to delivering on our science-based target by 2030."
"In 2021, we completed the following: Successfully piloted 17 mobile batteries, 70+ electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid vehicles, and one hydrogen power unit across 13 productions."
"This represented over 27,380 gallons of fuel saved and 264MT CO2e emission reductions17."
"Conducted energy efficiency audits on over 30% of our global sq ft. of offices and studios, identifying cost effective energy savings measures across the company."
"Purchased 40,000 gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel for our corporate aviation fleet and over 75,000 gallons of renewable diesel for use on productions."
Procured renewable electricity and certificates in an amount equal to all of our Scope 2 emissions.
"Procuring Renewable Electricity In 2021, we matched our global operations with 100% renewable electricity, including all offices and self-managed productions."
"This was achieved through a range of approaches that include onsite generation, clean supply from electricity service providers and landlords, as well as by purchasing renewable energy attribute certificates."
"Against our 2021 footprint, Netflix retired Energy Attribute Certificates, such as RECs, for electricity use in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, & United States."
"Deploying Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Charging Infrastructure In the past year, Netflix productions in Los Angeles, Vancouver and Toronto incorporated all-electric passenger vehicles into their production operations, and increased the number of plug-in hybrid and hybrid vehicles use, totalling more than 70 vehicles piloted this year, resulting in a fuel reduction of roughly 13,050 gallons of gasoline and 116 MTCO217."
"We also found that, despite a higher rental premium, when these passenger vehicles were used in high-mileage scenarios, productions saved money while also saving carbon."
"We plan to continue using electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2022 and will begin to pilot electric vans and medium duty trucks, while building out charging infrastructure across studios where we frequently produce our content."
"17 Includes reductions from productions ending in 2021, and accrued reductions from productions wrapped in 2022.Environmental 15Replacing Diesel Generators In 2021, we piloted replacing diesel generators with mobile electric batteries across eight productions."
"We wanted to understand the best use cases, barriers to adoption, cost and carbon savings with the electric substitute."
We found that mobile batteries successfully reduced the number of generator hours and in some cases replaced daily generator rentals.
"For example, on the set of Virgin River Season 4, our electric battery pilots reduced generator fuel consumption by about 20%."
"These electric units provided clean power for equipment trucks, crew catering, overnight power requirements, small shooting units or ancillary lighting setups."
"The units are silent compared to diesel generators, so cause no disruption and can be placed close to set."
"The batteries reduce noise and air pollution on and around the set, resulting in healthier air quality for our production crews and the communities where we film."
"Ramping Up Low- and Zero-Emission Fuels We began using commercial sources of renewable diesel on our productions in Los Angeles, Vancouver, and London (where it is known as HVO or hydrogenated vegetable oil), using 76,588 gallons in 2021."
For Bridgerton Season 2 we piloted a green hydrogen power unit for the first time in the UK.
The GeoPura unit powered many of the productions power needs while filming on location replacing multiple diesel generators.
"In addition to providing clean energy and drinkable water, the hydrogen unit had the added bonus of being quiet, which is helpful for filming and an improvement over current diesel generator technology."
"Encouraged by these results, we are expanding this green hydrogen pilot to more productions and facilities in the UK in 2022."
"These initial battery and hydrogen pilots resulted in an estimated fuel savings of roughly 14,330 gallons of diesel and 148 MTCO2.18 18 Includes reductions from productions ending in 2021, and accrued reductions from productions wrapped in 2022.16Environmental Emissions Reductions Summary In total these measures, listed in the table below, resulted in more than 14,000 tons of emissions reduced and avoided, which reduced our 2021 Scope 1 and 2 footprint by over 10%, compared to a business as usual scenario for the same year."
"These were primarily from switching to greener sources of electricity in key markets and conducting pilots of clean and silent mobile power solutions across our productions, as described in the above sections."

Sustained efforts across the public and private sectors will be required to drive the pace and scale of the transition.
"A few lessons learned from our first year: Its all about the long-game: In a growing company, its going to take a lot of work within the walls of Netflix and outside our walls - across the entertainment industry, and the broader economy - before we start to see meaningful emissions reductions."
This transformation will take years to implement.
This means our emissions may continue to rise in the coming years while we work with our partners to scale new technologies and business practices that will help us meet our emission reduction goals.
It takes industry collaboration and commitment: Reaching our reduction goals are also challenged by the fact that most of the emissions come from other companies.
"We dont own most of the equipment, vehicles or the majority of our buildings that contribute to our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions."
So its important we work with these companies to make clear whats needed from them and by when.
"Access to clean energy is patchy: Clean energy access remains spotty globally and is not uniformly available, even within the same U."
S. states.
Our ability to access clean energy is hampered by a patchwork of regulations and is directly restricted in certain key markets.
Access to 100% renewable electricity in all of our regions is key to meeting our reduction goals.
"Clean technology solutions exist, but not at scale: Promising clean technologies are not available at the scale or in all of the places we need them."
"Vendors working to scale these solutions fast will be required to deliver on our 2030 targets, and we aim to support them in doing so."
Scaled public investment in the zero carbon economy transition is needed: Making clean mobile energy technologies more affordable and EV charging infrastructure more available is needed to drive the zero carbon economy transition.
"Environmental18Environmental Our Carbon Credit Portfolio As the latest IPCC science shows, emissions cuts today are more valuable than in 5 or 10 years."
"Even if society is able to draw down emissions after surpassing 1.5C (overshoot), certain impacts then become irreversible."
"As IPCC working group co-chair Hans Otto Portner said, By restoring degraded ecosystems and effectively and equitably conserving 30 to 50% of Earths land, freshwater and ocean habitats, society can benefit from natures capacity to absorb and store carbon, and we can accelerate progress towards sustainable development, but adequate finance and political support are essential."
This science drives our investment in nature.
"We do this through carbon credit projects that prevent carbon from entering the atmosphere, called carbon sinks, and through projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere by regenerating natural ecosystems."
"Over time, were increasingly focused on removals."
Nature-based retention and removals: Nature has been regulating the earths climate since time immemorial.
So investing in existing and potential carbon stocks in nature is important (IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land).
"From stocks like terrestrial to marine forests to regenerative agriculture, some of the best solutions to healing the planet are right beneath our feet."
"Methane avoidance and destruction: In addition to nature-based solutions, the IPCC emphasized that addressing methane emissions is critical because of its outsized impact on near-term global heating."
So we have added high-quality methane avoidance and destruction projects to our portfolio.
"Building a High Quality Portfolio of Carbon Credit Projects Carbon markets arent perfect, so we conduct five levels of due diligence, described below in Table 3, before carbon credit projects become a part of our portfolio."
"In addition to mitigating climate change, these carbon credit projects strengthen and protect vulnerable and disadvantaged communities by: protecting biodiversity, increasing food security, protecting drinking water, generating new jobs and educational opportunities, and providing climate resilience.19Environmental Table 3: Carbon Credit Project Screening Criteria Screen 1: Competitive selection Screen 4: Use digital tools and resources to improve visibility Screen 5: Seek additional expert adviceScreen 3: Deep project- level diligence and impact screeningScreen 2: Meet core quality criteriaOur competitive requests for proposals (RFPs) are issued widely, to over 75 project developers, non-profits, brokers, and credit retailers across many project types and geographies."
Our team then conducts due diligence on the projects and holds live interviews directly with the project developers and/or trusted project partners.
"This includes research on the projects, their proponents, and other local stakeholders."
Engaging directly with the project hosts enables a deeper understanding of the unique circumstances and conditions that surround a particular carbon credit project and how and why it came to be.
We also conduct additional screens for: local community ownership and direct benefit sharing; job creation and training; women and girls empowerment; biodiversity and habitat restoration and protection (e.g.
"Verra Climate, Community & Biodiversity certified projects); and climate resilience impacts."
"Where feasible, we use technology to enhance project validation and verification, such as AI-powered satellite imagery, machine learning and remote sensing analysis."
"Netflix relies on its expert advisory group to provide additional insight and guidance on an ongoing basis across a range of key issues, including our carbon credit portfolio."
This helps us identify things we may have missed.
"Any credits that we purchase must meet globally recognized core quality criteria: they must be additional, verified, based on a realistic baseline, not double counted, and issued by a credible standard that has robust provisions in place to address permanence (the risk of reversal) and leakage (the risk of displacing emissions from one location to another)."
"We only purchase credits that have been third-party verified and registered on a trusted registry, including Verra, Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve, and American Carbon Registry-or have demonstrated an equivalent level of rigor."
"Based upon these five screens, the following 17 projects were selected for our 2021 carbon credit portfolio."
"Seventy-three percent of the credits by volume have received an additional certification under Verras Climate, Community & Biodiversity program, meaning they are exemplars of maximizing benefits in addition to climate, like habitat restoration, biodiversity protection and sustainable livelihoods."

The use of mycorrhizal fungi to innoculate seedlings before planting results in significant increases to biomass growth (up to 83% in the first year) as a result of the symbiotic relationship between the fungi and trees.
"Though the trees that are planted are mainly non-native, non-invasive species, there are native tree species scattered throughout that are not allowed to be removed; these native species provide additional benefits and income for landowners through the sale of tea, honey, and other medicinal uses."

The following chart illustrates our current planned path to our 2030 targets and the decarbonization levers that will get us there.
The left axis shows the emissions-driving activities of the baseline footprint in 2019.
"The right axis indicates the estimated percentage of emissions reductions required from the forecasted 2030 footprint to achieve the 2030 target, based on our internal analysis and modeling."
"Our Current 2030 Low-Carbon Transition Plan By way of example, the chart highlights that 35% of our 2019 baseline carbon footprint is from electricity - to achieve our 2030 targets we expect to reduce emissions from electricity by 24% relative to our forecasted business-as-usual footprint via renewable resources."
"Fossil fuels touch every part of our physical operations, so there are a range of decarbonization levers we will pull to meet our emission reduction goals."
These range from energy efficiency to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).
"Our two main sources of internal emissions are (1) the fuel we burn, and (2) electricity we consume."
"This includes using fossil-fuel generated electricity and the direct combustion of fossil fuels for heating buildings, creating mobile electricity supply (e.g."
"diesel generators for film sets), and in transportation: vehicles & planes."

SUSTAINABILITY IN STORYTELLING Last year we described sustainability as an epic story.
Dont Look Up s writer-director- producer has since described it as the story of all stories in the history of stories.
The breakout success of Dont Look Up confirmed our analysis from last years report: hundreds of millions of households choose to watch titles that shine a light on sustainability.
"But, Dont Look Up was only one of the many Netflix films and TV series across different genres that shone a spotlight on sustainability in 2021: Comedy: Bo Burnhams Inside, Workin Moms, A Castle for Christmas, Ginny & Georgia, Grace & Frankie Documentaries: Animal, Breaking Boundaries, Explained: The End of Oil, Gather, Life in Colour with David Attenborough, The Minimalists, Penguin Town, Puff: Wonders of the Reef Dramas: Japan Sinks, Midnight Mass, Midnight Sky, Ragnarok, Silent Sea, Sweet Tooth, Tribes of Europa (with references in the hits Army of Thieves and Red Notice) Kids & Family: Ada Twist Scientist, Bigfoot Family, Octonauts: Above and Beyond, Vivo, Waffles and Mochi Unscripted: Best Leftovers Ever, Blown Away, Izzys Koala World, Queer Eye In 2021, we made it easier for members to find many of these diverse stories by curating the Together for Our Planet collection launched in advance of COP26 in partnership with the UK government (and COP Presidency).27Dont Look Up This cautionary tale about climate inaction is our second most popular film of all time driving nearly 360M viewing hours in its first 28 days on our service, the film also sparked extensive conversation online and in the media, primarily driven by its climate theme."
"We supported the filmmakers by: Inspiring meaningful conversations about climate change in the scientific community [Dr. Ayana Johnson, Dr. Peter Kalmus, Dr. Marshall Shepherd, Dr. Michael Mann], among policymakers [ Truman Center , UK Parliament], with press [CBS Sunday Morning, Amanpour & Co , Time, NYT , The Hill] and the broader climate community [Hopecast with Jane Goodall, Outrage + Optimism, UN Act Now on Climate Change] including NGOs [Birdlife International, The Nature Conservancy]."

"Creating a Dont Look Up Discussion Guide to help people explore themes in the film and engaged 14 climate voices, with Adam McKays support, to rewrite a more hopeful ending to Dont Look Up ."
"Breaking Boundaries In June we released Breaking Boundaries by Silverback Studios, in which globally recognized scientist Dr. Johan Rockstrom and Sir David Attenborough lay out several fast- approaching tipping points to ecological collapse but also the signs that a green revolution may be reaching tipping points of its own."
"President Joe Biden shared the film with 40 Heads of State at the Leaders Summit on Climate in April 2021, 100 Nobel Laureates endorsed its recommendations in May, and Sir David Attenborough used footage from the film at his G7 keynote in June."
"With non-profit Count-Us-In as well as climate experts, filmmakers and TikTok creators, this Breaking Boundaries climate platform helped individuals to learn more about climate actions they can take."
"Environmental Many of our filmmakers seek to entertain and enrich their viewers experience with educational, conversation-sparking and community-building resources."
"Working with select filmmakers and non-profit partners, we supported two pilots in 2021:28Environmental 4."
"CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT & DISCLOSURE In 2021, we conducted a climate risk assessment as part of the companys risk assessment process (which is presented to the Board annually) for the first time, led jointly by our Internal Audit and Sustainability teams."
"This evaluation looked at a range of climate risks, including: physical, product and services, and transitional (governance) risks."
"This analysis illustrated that the climate risks we assessed are either mapped to risk mitigation strategies already in place or underway, or were not deemed material to the business."
There were no material climate risks that were identified for Netflix through this analysis.
"We used external sources (TCFD , IPCC AR5, COSO framework specific to ESG) to build the initial climate risk framework, and also leveraged Datamaran (software for ESG risk, regulation, and reporting) to perform a gap analysis."
We also worked in 2021 to pilot integrating climate risk analysis into our real estate evaluation and acquisition systems across the company and are in the process of integrating sustainability considerations- including climate risk assessments- into our standard business operations and processes.
"In July 2021, we responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) investor questionnaire, joining thousands of other reporting companies."

COLLABORATING ACROSS BOUNDARIES We continue to rely on a community of partners to pave the way for our industry and those industries we partner with.
"New additions since our last ESG report: Business Alliance for Scaling Climate Solutions (BASCS): We co-launched BASCS at COP26 with Disney, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Workday, Salesforce, WWF, the United Nations and EDF to share best practices and insights to scale and improve climate solutions."
"SABA : We co-founded the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance because the entertainment industry cant make film or television without travel, including titles that themselves help raise environmental awareness."
SABA sends market signals to producers of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and ensures the environmental integrity of their claims.
"Exponential Roadmap Initiative: Netflix was invited to join this frontrunning group of sustainability leaders from the scientific, corporate and multilateral sectors working together to halve emissions before 2030 through exponential climate action and solutions."
Theyre an accredited partner of the UNs Race to Zero and TED Countdown.
"We continue to work in concert with: albert: We joined alberts sustainable production project in 2018, and multiple UK Netflix productions have engaged with alberts industry offering."
"Sustainable Production Alliance: We joined the alliance in 2019, and direct Netflix productions to the resources available at GreenProductionGuide.com."
Drawdown Labs (part of Project Drawdown): This consortium of companies explores scientifically-grounded best practices in consumer-facing sustainability.
"DIMPACT : The collaborative project, supported by researchers from the University of Bristol, created a tool to calculate the emissions of video streaming, among other internet uses."
"Natural Resources Defense Council: We continue to partner with NRDC as part of our fact-checking service for filmmakers.30Social To entertain our members, who come from all around the world, we need to work with a diversity of creators as well as have a diverse workforce."

"However, for decades, historically underrepresented communities have been either defined by a single story or worse, entirely absent from our screens."
Research shows that more perspectives behind the camera leads to better representation in front of the camera.
So last year we created the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity to help create new opportunities for underrepresented communities within the entertainment industry.
"The fund includes a commitment of $100M dollars over five years to help develop a strong, diverse pipeline of creatives around the world."
"In our first 12 months, we worked with over 25 organizations globally - committing $14.5M towards programs that help identify, train and provide work placements for underrepresented creatives around the world."
"Of that, over $5M is specifically to support women."
"Several of these programs have already enabled new filmmakers to hone their craft by providing them with mentorship and development, as well as an opportunity to create short films."
"While were still early on in this work, were committed to helping build a legacy of inclusion in the industry."

Inclusion Inside Netflix: Progress Since Our First Report Our members come from many different countries and cultures and to entertain them we need a workplace thats equally diverse.
"Last January, we dove deep into everything were doing on inclusion in the company by publishing Netflixs first inclusion report."
We published an update in February 2022 on our progress in the 2021 calendar year.
"Netflix grew from about 8,000 to 10,000 full-time streaming employees globally in 2021."
"In the US where we collect and report race and ethnicity data we grew from 6,300 to 7,300 employees."

"Were expanding inclusive hiring training for recruiters and managers, creating access for emerging talent by adding three Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and more HBCUs (totaling four) to our pipeline programs, and finding new ways to diversify our executive and company networks."
"While increasing representation is important, its only part of the work."
So we continue to build an inclusive workplace where everyone can thrive.
The strategy we laid out in our first inclusion report remains the same.
"First, were improving our culture of inclusion and belonging."
"This past year, we: Conducted our annual compensation review to ensure pay equity across the company, Progressed inclusions trainings across all our offices, most recently launching an internal leadership initiative on how to lead inclusively, Continued offering inclusive benefits, including gender-inclusive parental leave, transgender and non-binary care in our US health plans, and family-forming support for employees regardless of marital status, gender, or sexual orientation, and Supported our growing employee resource group program around the world."
"Last year, we held 90 virtual learning workshops on inclusion topics ranging from accessibility on service to understanding US Latino/a/x representation on-screen."
"These workshops help employees look at every decision with an inclusion lens, asking questions like, whose voice is missing?"
Who is being excluded?
Are we portraying this authentically?
"Last year, at least 4,500 employees participated in a virtual learning workshop.38Social Third, weve expanded the inclusion strategy team to sharpen our inclusion lens around the world, adding leaders in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, while expanding the team in Europe, the Middle East and Africa."
"We have a lot more work to do, particularly in recruiting more US Latino/a/x, Indigenous and other historically excluded talent."
"Were also improving how we understand the representation of our workforce outside of the US reporting requirements like additional gender identities, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, and in other countries."
Transformational change wont happen overnight.
"Progress takes consistent discipline, heart and practice."
"Were committed to doing our part in inspiring change within our industries so more people can feel seen, heard, and supported to contribute at their best."
"Fulfilling our Pledge to Black Banks In December 2021, we fulfilled our 2020 pledge to move two percent of our cash holdings around $100 million into Black banks and other Black-led financial institutions in the U."
"S. More capital moving into these institutions means more home and small-business loans, resulting in more opportunities for Black communities."
"Because we pegged our commitment to 2% of Netflixs cash, the investment also grows over time."
So we will be topping up our commitment at the end of the year and moving more cash over and above the $100 million already committed into these institutions.
"Its been rewarding to see many other companies follow suit, and the impact these changes have had on people like Dominique Lumpkin, who just bought her first home in Memphis."
"Or Colby Midget, who kept the doors open to her floral shop despite the toll of the pandemic."
"Both were possible because of Netflixs early investment in Hope Credit Union, a community development financial institution (CDFI) that serves underbanked communities in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee."

"Governance, in this context, means finding the right balance of rights and responsibilities among shareholders, the Board, and management, and ensuring that there are appropriate checks and balances in place."
"With the rapid evolution of technology and the changing media landscape, we are continually adjusting our service to meet the needs and desires of our consumers."
Our governance structure has been deliberately constructed to help us to do that.
"Our focus is on creating long-term value for our shareholders, and we have been successful at that since our initial public offering in 2002, annualized total stockholder return through December 31, 2021 was 38%."
"While our current governance structure has served our shareholders extraordinarily well with a sustained period of substantial growth, weve clearly proven our business model: streaming is now an established business, were self-funding and expect sustained positive free cash flow, and weve substantially scaled our revenues, operating profit and margins."
"As such, the Board has decided to evolve to a more standard large- cap governance structure, and will be recommending several changes at the upcoming 2022 annual meeting including elimination of supermajority voting provisions, allowing shareholders to call special meetings, and proposing that the Board declassify and stand for annual elections."
We will also change the voting standard for our directors in uncontested elections.
We strive to stay in tune with our ownership base.
"Our Board and our management team engage directly and regularly with our shareholders, and our Board and its committees consider shareholders feedback in assessing our governance structure, including our compensation program."
"This past fall, we convened a virtual ESG investor day that brought directors, management and various subject matter experts together with a range of our shareholders representing approximately 40% of shares outstanding."
This provided a direct opportunity to share information and perspectives and we appreciated the time and candor of those in attendance.
These engagements provide a good opportunity to share views and answer questions; the input from our shareholders will continue to inform our ongoing evaluation of our structure.
