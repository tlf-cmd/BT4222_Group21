"Advocating for strong climate policies Apples climate policy advocacy centers on several principles, each of which govern Apples public policy positions on climate: Set strong targets based on science; disclose comprehensive emissions; create sector- specific policies; and support a green economy for all."
"In April 2021, we made a public statement calling for mandatory disclosures of global greenhouse gases across all emissions scopes."
The statement also focused the discussion within industry and government toward greater transparency and increased attention by regulators.
"In May 2021, Apple also became one of the first companies to voice support for the enactment of the Clean Energy Standard (CES) that would decarbonize the power grid by 2035."
"And at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021, Apple called for bold government action on climate change, joining several new initiatives, including the First Movers Coalition, the Forest Investor Club, and the Clean Energy Demand Initiative."
We also advocate for country-specific measures that motivate climate action.
"For example, weve called for enhanced climate ambition and renewable energy deployment in Japans Basic Energy Plan and Nationally Determined Contribution (Japans plan to reduce emissions in furtherance of the Paris Agreement), and for Advocating for changeApples 2022 ESG Report 9 Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Our commitment to human rights Embedding respect for human rights Weve worked to embed respect for human rights across our company in the technology we make, the way we make it, and how we treat people."
"A number of teams are responsible for carrying out human rights due diligence, including the Privacy, Corporate, and Compliance teams within Apples Legal and Global Security organization, as well as Apples Environment and Supply Chain Innovation (ESCI) team within Worldwide Operations."
Our commitment begins with treating everyone with dignity and respect.
But it doesnt end there.
We believe in the power of technology to empower and connect people around the world and that business can and should be a force for good.
Identifying and managing salient human rights risks Identifying human rights risks is the first step to addressing those risks through improvements to our policies and management systems.
"We work to align our efforts with the business and human rights due diligence process set forth in the UNGPs to identify, mitigate, prevent, and remedy human rights risks."
"We identify salient human rights risks through internal risk assessments and external industry- level third-party audits, as well as through the channels we maintain with rights holders and other stakeholders, including investors, human rights and labor experts, governments, and international bodies such as the UN."
"In addition to our own internal monitoring, we consider reports identifying potential risks from external sources, including international organizations, policy makers, shareholders, civil society organizations, news outlets, customers, individuals in the supply chain or supply chain communities, whistleblower mechanisms, and third-party hotlines."
"Reports also come through the reporting mechanisms we make available directly to all supplier employees, Apple employees, and the general public."
These reports can come to us in any language and can be anonymous.
Our commitment to civil rights We are deeply committed to building a more just and inclusive world and are moving forward with plans to conduct a civil rights audit.
"Apples Human Rights Policy Our Human Rights Policy governs how we treat everyone, including our customers, employees, business partners, and people across our supply chain."
"Were deeply committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in our business operations, as set out in the United Nations (UN) International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organizations (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work."
Our approach is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).
We conduct human rights due diligence to identify risks and work to mitigate them.
"We also seek to remedy adverse impacts, track and measure our progress, and report our findings."
Our board of directors adopted the policy and is responsible for overseeing and periodically reviewing it.
"Apples Senior Vice President and General Counsel is responsible for its implementation, and reports to the Board and its committees on our progress and significant issues."
"Apples 2022 ESG Report 10 Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Based on this due diligence, examples of human rights issues of particular focus at Apple include: Privacy, freedom of expression, and access to information risks Discrimination risks in workforce management and in product and services development Labor and human rights risks in the supply chain Across Apple, teams such as ESCI, EPSI, People, Privacy, and others work to avoid, prevent, mitigate and where appropriate, remediate human rights issues and impacts across Apples business, including through our commitments to: Respecting the rights to privacy, freedom of expression, and access to information Promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, including in our workforce, leadership, product and services development, and our industry Respecting labor and human rights in our supply chain by working closely with suppliers so that people in our supply chain are treated with dignity and respect Respecting human rights through our efforts to protect the planet in how we design, build, and recycle our products, and through responsible sourcing and use of materials and natural resourcesTracking progress Were committed to continually assessing our progress and incorporating what we learn into our work."

Weve committed to achieving carbon neutrality reducing emissions 75 percent compared with fiscal year 2015 and balancing the residual emissions with carbon removal across the life cycle of all of our products by 2030.1 And the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has validated an emissions reduction target for Apple derived from this goal.2 Its an ambitious plan with plenty of challenges ahead.
"But were already well on our way, having cut carbon emissions across our value chain by 40 percent since fiscal year 2015."
"Our work began years ago, making the transition to sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity at our offices, retail stores, and data centers, At Apple, were acting with urgency to protect our planets limited resources and to be a leader in the fight against climate change."
"Since 2020, weve been carbon neutral for our worldwide operations, and by 2030, we plan to expand that progress to our entire supply chain and the lifetime use of our products."
"And today, nearly 20 percent of the materials in our products were made from recycled content a number were working toincrease."
"Across our environmental work, were also committed to being a force for equity."
Were working with communities on the frontlines of climate change and the next generation of diverse entrepreneurs to create shared opportunity and to build a more just world.
"Our approach The environmental challenges we face today are significant, and were responding with urgency and dedication."
We approach our work by focusing on fundamental questions.
What matters most?
And where can we make the greatest impact?
"These questions guide our work across our strategic focus areas of climate change, resources, and smarter chemistry and inform our goals in how we can best achieve change."
We know were not alone in working to reduce our environmental footprint.
So were engaging with others to support our efforts and find opportunities to lift local communities along the way.
Setting ambitious goals is essential to our approach to drive the innovation and collaboration that makes change possible and to be transparent and accountable to our progress.
"Our work is led by Lisa Jackson, Apples Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook."
"The Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives team works with other teams across Apple to set strategy, engage stakeholders, and communicate progress."
Our integrated approach means that decisions about the environment are reviewed and supported at the highest levels of the company.
Our 2022 Environmental Progress Report provides a detailed overview of our work and how were progressing toward our goals.which we achieved in 2018.
"And in 2020, we reached the milestone of being carbon neutral for our corporate operations, including direct emissions as well as business travel and employee commute."
"Our 10-year Climate Roadmap is addressing Apples carbon footprint through five pillars: Low-carbon design: We will design products and manufacturing processes to be less carbon-intensive through thoughtful material selection, increased material efficiency, and greater product energy efficiency."
"Energy efficiency: We will increase energy efficiency at our facilities and in our supply chain by finding opportunities, such as retrofitting, to reduce energy use."
"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 13Renewable electricity: We will continue to source 100 percent renewable electricity for our facilities, and transition our entire supply chain to 100 percent clean, renewable sources of electricity."
"Direct emissions abatement: We will reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions in our facilities and our supply chain through process innovation, emissions abatement, and the use of non- fossil -based low -carbon fuels."
"Carbon removal: Working in parallel with our emissions reduction efforts, we will scale up investments in carbon removal projects, including nature -based solutions that protect and restore ecosystems around the world."
"Low-carbon design To reduce the carbon footprint of our products, were increasing efficiency and transitioning to materials from recycled sources and those made using low-carbon energy."
"In 2021, we continued to improve the carbon efficiency of the integrated circuits we use in our products components weve prioritized because they are carbon-intensive."
"For example, switching to the Apple M1 chip for the 13-inch MacBook Pro reduced the energy needed to manufacture and use the device, driving down the products carbon footprint by over 8 percent."
Weve continued to expand our use of 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures of a number of products.
"All iPad models in our lineup now use 100 percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures joining Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch SE, MacBook Air, Mac mini, and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro devices."
"For products released in 2021 that had enclosures made with primary aluminum, we Energy efficiency Were focused on using less energy across our operations, beginning with how we design, operate, and maintain our facilities."
"And we continue these same efforts into our supply chain, which benefits the communities where our suppliers operate."
Drawing less energy from electrical grids many of which still rely heavily on fossil fuels helps reduce local air pollution and improve air quality for nearby communities.
The emissions from manufacturing our products account for about 70 percent of Apples gross carbon footprint.
We launched our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program in 2015 with the goal of helping suppliers optimize their facilities and operations to use as little energy as possible.
We provide guidance designed to help suppliers uncover opportunities for energy efficiency.
"Suppliers in our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program avoided more than 1,150,000 annualized metric tons of supply chain carbon emissions in fiscal year 2021.40% decrease in emissions across our entire value chain since 2015 100% renewable energy sourced for all Apple facilities 213 suppliers committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple production $4.7B issued in green bonds to model how businesses can drive investments to reduce global emissions."
"In our latest Green Bond Impact Report , we share progress on the projects funded in fiscal year 2021."
"To minimize the carbon footprint of our products, we seek to create less waste in the processing of materials, reduce machining time and the associated energy used, more efficiently transform material into the shapes we need, and maximize recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap."
prioritized the use of aluminum smelted using low-carbon sources of electricity rather than fossil fuels for a lower carbon impact.
These changes alone have decreased the carbon emissions associated with our use of aluminum by 68 percent since 2015.
Product energy use accounts for 22 percent of our gross carbon footprint and has an impact on the individual energy use of each of our customers.
"By addressing this in the earliest phases of design, weve cut the product energy use across all major product lines by more than 70 percent since 2008 through energy efficiency improvements.3 In fiscal year 2021, over 99 percent of Apples eligible products, by revenue, received an ENERGY STAR rating for superior energy efficiency.4 And over 99 percent of Apples eligible products, by revenue, met the requirements for EPEAT registration.5 Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 14 Gross emissions Avoided emissions Emissions offsetCorporate footprint Product footprint 0.02% Direct emissions (Scope 1)0% Electricity (Scope 2)0.5% Business travel and commute (Scope 3)70% Product manufacturing (Scope 3)22% Product use (Scope 3)8% Product transport (Scope 3)0.3% End-of-life product processing (Scope 3)Gross emissions Offsets Emissions categories (% of gross emissions)Corporate energ y Corporate energ y efficiency:efficiency: 0.06 million metric tons avoided Use of renewable Use of renewable electricity:electricity: 1.0 million metric tons avoided Load reduction and Load reduction and mode switching: mode switching: 0.2 million metric tons avoidedtons avoidedFY21 REC purchase:FY21 REC purchase: 0.2 million metric tons avoided Product energ y efficiency:Product energ y efficiency: 0.2 million metric tons avoidedSupplier clean energ y:Supplier clean energ y: 13.9 million metric tons avoidedLow-carbon materials*:Low-carbon materials*: 7.3 million metric tons avoidedFY21 REC purchase:FY21 REC purchase: 0.4 million metric tons avoided Supplier energ y efficiency:Supplier energ y efficiency: 1.1 million metric tons avoidedApples comprehensive carbon footprint This past year we intensified our efforts to reduce Apples emissions."
"In fiscal year 2021, we avoided over 23 million metric tons of emissions across all scopes."
"Initiatives that weve been growing for years like sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for our facilities, transitioning suppliers to clean energy, and using low-carbon materials in products yielded indisputable results."
"Thanks to this work, weve begun to decouple business growth from emissions: While our revenue grew 33 percent, our emissions grew by less than 5 percent."
"To mitigate this increase in emissions, we applied an additional 0.6 million tons of renewable energy credits (RECs) and 0.5 million metric tons of carbon offsets to proportionally cover electricity use and direct emissions, respectively, across our value chain."
This represents a short-term bridging solution as we grow our carbon reduction programs to meet the scale of the challenge.
"* Low-carbon materials represents emissions savings from transitioning to recycled materials in our products, or use of low-carbon aluminum, as described on page 18."
** Net carbon emissions represents our total gross footprint minus carbon offsets applied to each category.
Percentages shown for each emissions category represent the share of Apples gross footprint.
"Totals add up to more than 100 percent, due to rounding.22.5 million metric tons net carbon emissions ** Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 15Renewable electricity Our retail stores, data centers, and offices around the world currently source 100 percent renewable electricity."
"Weve focused our efforts to source renewables around several key pillars: creating new renewable energy projects, undertaking projects that deliver clear benefits to local communities, and supporting renewable energy innovations."
About 1.5 gigawatts of Apple-created renewable electricity projects account for over 90 percent of the renewable electricity our facilities use.
We continue to experience tremendous progress toward our goal of transitioning our manufacturing supply chain to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030.
"As of March 2022, 213 manufacturing partners in 25 countries have committed to 100 percent renewable energy for Apple production."
"Over 70 percent of companies on Apples Supplier List those suppliers that make up 98 percent of Apples direct spend for materials, manufacturing, and assembly of our products worldwide have committed to 100 percent renewable electricity."
"In addition, many other smaller suppliers have also made these commitments."
"Direct emissions abatement To address the non-electricity emissions associated with our materials and manufacturing processes, we seek technological solutions through emissions abatement or switching to low-carbon fuel options."
"For example, we partnered with aluminum companies and the governments of Canada and Quebec to help fund research and development for ELYSIS, a technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from aluminum smelting."
"Many components essential to products like ours, including integrated circuit chips and display panels, currently rely on manufacturing processes that use fluorinated gases, which have high global warming potential."
Were partnering closely with key manufacturers to prevent these gases from being released into the atmosphere by optimizing manufacturing processes and deploying abatement technologies.
"To address emissions from shipping products to our customers, were shifting whenever possible toward less carbon-intensive shipping modes, such as rail and ocean."
"And were seeking out technical innovations, including alternative fuels and electric vehicles."
"In fiscal year 2021, Apple avoided 180,000 metric tons of CO 2e by shifting the mode of transport and reducing product weight through the removal of the power adapter from the box of iPhone devices."
"Providing access to clean energy in South Africa Even a few years ago, not everyone in one community in South Africa had electricity at home."
Many people had been using battery-powered lanterns because upfront costs and other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach.
"As we worked with our partners to identify new renewable energy projects for our Power for Impact program, we saw exciting potential in this community."
"Our partner on the ground, DC GO, a solar energy provider based in Johannesburg, got to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs."
"Ultimately, DC GO developed a pay-as-you-go model that brought solar energy to 3500 homes that previously lacked access."
This was possible only because of the way they built relationships with community members and worked with Apple to price the solution in line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns.
"In addition, DC GO hired and trained local people for jobs in sales, maintenance, and other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project and the communitys access to electricity would be sustainable over time."
"This is just one example of how the Power for Impact program is working to benefit communities, our company, and the environment at the same time."

"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 16Carbon removal To address the emissions we cant yet avoid, were are investing in carbon removal projects."
"In addition to removing carbon, nature-based carbon removal projects also offer important ecological and social benefits, such as preserving biodiversity and enhancing the resilience of ecosystems, while often providing economic development opportunities for local communities."
"We partnered with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs to launch the innovative Restore Fund, which seeks to blend responsible forestry practices with carbon removal: Were working with forestry managers to create sustainably managed forests that optimize for both carbon and wood production, creating revenue from timber, and generating high- quality carbon credits."
"Apple will invest up to $200 million in projects that aim to remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it, all while meeting clear social and environmental impact criteria and offering a financial return."
"In its pilot phase, the Restore Fund has a goal of removing at least 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year."
"For more information on our efforts to combat climate change and reach our 2030 carbon neutral goal, read our 2022 Environmental Progress Report ."
"Climate scenario analysis In 2020, we conducted a climate scenario analysis to help us better understand the potential physical and transition effects of climate change."
"To align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, we considered a range of future scenarios, including a scenario below 2C."
And we assessed geographies around the world to capture both corporate and supplier activities.
The analysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to our corporate resiliency.
"It also provided environmental data that we considered in developing business strategies, including considerations around supply chain diversification, as well as safeguarding our global assets."
"Were committed to managing regulatory, reputational, and market risks related to climate change."
"For more information on these climate-related risks and Apples governance of these risks, read our 2021 CDP submission (PDF) ."
"As the Restore Fund projects come online, weve partnered with Conservation International to develop and invest in nature-based carbon removal projects."
"This includes a project to protect and restore 27,000 acres of mangrove forests in Colombia."
"As the projects in the Restore Fund come online, were also working to address difficult- to-avoid emissions in the short term."
"In fiscal year 2021, 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits were retired from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal year 2021."
"And we purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total of 500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain: a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala and a reforestation project in Guizhou Province of China ."
These projects are all certified to the VCS and CCB standards.
"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 17Resources Natural resources make our work possible and we take responsibility for how we source, use, and recycle the materials we rely on to create our products."
"As a starting point, this means sourcing responsibly, minimizing our freshwater use, and eliminating waste across our operations and those of our suppliers."
And were also seeking to redefine the overall resource footprint of our products.
Our goal is to one day make products using only responsibly sourced recycled and renewable materials.
"Within resources, we focus on three main areas of impact: Materials: Transitioning to only recycled or renewable materials in our products and packaging, and maximizing material efficiency, product longevity, and recovery."
"Water: Reducing water impacts in the manufacturing of our products, use of our services, and operation of our facilities."
"At the same time, transitioning to alternative sources, improving the quality of water we discharge, and protecting shared water resources."
"Zero waste: Minimizing overall waste generated and eliminating waste sent to landfill from our manufacturing supply chain as well as corporate offices, data centers, and retail stores."
Materials We aim to make the best use of the materials we rely on to make our products.
Thats why were focusing on three different levers to reduce our footprint and achieve circularity: sourcing and efficiency; product longevity; and product end-of-life.
"Sourcing and efficiency Last year, we made progress across materials from expanding our use of recycled rare earth elements to designing cameras with recycled gold."
"In September, we introduced iPhone 13, with more certified recycled materials than any previous version of iPhone."
We also introduced 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures on every single model in the iPad lineup.
"Welcoming the first class of the Impact Accelerator Last year, we welcomed the first class to our Impact Accelerator, a program for Black- ,Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses headquartered in the United States that share our focus on innovation and our commitment to the environment."
"Part of Apples Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (see page 60 ), the Accelerator aims to help combat systemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions for communities most impacted by climate change."
We selected our first class of 15 businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy to begin the program in August 2021.
"The three-month program included live virtual sessions, online courses on supply chain management, supplier diversity, financial and legal subjects, as well as one-on-one mentorship with an Apple expert on topics from renewable energy to responsible sourcing."
"The goal of the Impact Accelerator is to better position the participating companies for growth, to improve their abilities to take on larger contracts, and to expand their customer base all while fostering their environmental commitment."
"For example, last October we announced that we will be working with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, formed by six Sioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources, on a project to create a wind power development in the Midwest."
"And following the success of this years class, our efforts continue."
"This spring, applications opened for the next class to join our Impact Accelerator."
"For Apples inaugural Impact Accelerator, leaders from 15 companies participated in a three-month virtual program with customized training and access to Apple expert mentors."
"20% In fiscal year 2021, nearly 20 percent of thematerial we shipped in products came from recycled and renewable sources 2x In fiscal year 2021, we more than doubled our use of recycled tungsten, rare earth elements, and cobalt and introduced certified recycled gold for the first time in an Apple product 75% Weve reduced the plastic in our packaging by 75 percent compared with 2015, progressing toward our goal to eliminate all plastic from our packaging by 2025 Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 18Across our business, we released eight products with more than 20 percent recycled content.6 The MacBook Air with M1 chip (2020) had the highest total made with 44 percent recycled content device-wide, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure."
These and other innovations helped us increase our use of recycled or renewable content to 18 percent of all the material shipped in products in fiscal year 2021.7Product longevity We want to make the most of the materials we use through designing long-lasting products.
"We are designing durable hardware, leveraging software updates to extend functionality, expanding access to repair services, refurbishing devices for their next user, and reusing parts that still have more to give."
Read more on caring for customers on page 56.
"Product end-of-life By effectively recovering the materials in our products, we enable the circular supply chains that make the best use of finite resources."
"Through our work in this area, were reducing the need to mine new materials and the amount of energy needed to manufacture new products, ultimately driving down emissions and conserving resources."
"In 99 percent of the countries where we sell products, we continue to provide and participate in product take-back and recycling collection programs."
"With the help of customer and employee participation across recycling programs, we directed more than 38,000 metric tons of e-waste to recycling globally in fiscal year 2021."
Weve also continued to innovate on disassembly technologies.
"Daisy, the robot we designed to disassemble iPhone devices, has now been joined by Dave, which dismantles Taptic Engines from iPhone to enable the recovery of materials like rare earth elements, tungsten, and steel, and Taz, designed to recycle modules containing rare earth magnets."
"At our Material Recovery Lab were working on developing better, more efficient means of disassembling products that maximize material recovery, while minimizing waste."
Water stewardship Were committed to managing the resources we share with the communities where we and our suppliers operate.
"Our efforts to address the water footprint of our corporate sites and of our suppliers sites focus on: Using water efficiently Expanding the use of alternative water sources, including onsite reuse Discharging water responsibly Enhancing our water stewardship to keep watersheds healthy for all who rely on them In fiscal year 2021, our facilities used about 1.4 billion gallons of water."
"We saved 133 million gallons of freshwater this fiscal year due to efficiency projects implemented since 2017 .9 Last year, alternative water sources accounted for 10 percent of our total corporate water usage primarily from recycled water sources.10 Our supply chain accounts for 99 percent of our total water footprint, based on our detailed water inventory."
Thats why we partner closely with our suppliers through our Clean Water Program.
The more than 195 participating supplier sites increased their average reuse rate to 41 percent and saved our suppliers 12.3 billion gallons of freshwater in fiscal year 2021 for a total of 50.3 billion gallons of water savings since the programs launch in2013.11Innovating packaging to reduce our footprint Weve made significant progress toward eliminating all plastics from our packaging by 2025.
"This past year, plastics accounted for only 4 percent of our packaging."
"Since 2015, weve dedicated our efforts to replacing large plastic trays, wraps, and foam cushioning with fiber alternatives that have higher recovery rates and reduced environmental footprints."
"This year, the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro were the first iPhone models to be shipped without any plastic packaging components.8 And we replaced plastic foam with a fiber alternative to protect the 24-inch iMac during shipping."
"For the 24-inch iMac, using corrugated fiber rather than foam for shock absorption allowed us to reduce plastic by 72 percent."
"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 19Smarter chemistry The well-being of our employees, customers, people in our supply chain, and the planet is a priority for Apple, which is why were committed to using safer materials to create safer products."
"This commitment requires diligent work to build a comprehensive picture of chemicals across our supply chain, to insist on rigorous chemical management processes, to promote adoption of safer chemical alternatives, and to innovate through design smarter approaches to making our products."
"Using safer chemistry in our products also enables recycling and material recovery, so that our products can be the raw materials for the next generation."
"The pillars of our smarter chemistry strategy are: Mapping and engagement: Engage our supply chain partners to comprehensively identify the chemicals in the materials used to make our products, allowing us to drive change that goes beyond what is required for regulatory compliance."
Assessment and management: Assess the potential human health and environmental risks of chemicals to evaluate compliance with our requirements and inform product design.
Innovation: Drive the development and use of innovative materials that enable the creation of groundbreaking products and also support industrywide change.
Mapping and engagement Our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program maps the chemicals used in our products an effort that includes tens of thousands of parts and assemblies.
Then we look at how our products are manufactured.
Our Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) program engages with supply chain partners to get the most recent information on which materials are in use.
"This information includes the volume of materials being consumed and how theyre being applied, stored, and handled as well as the steps being taken to protect employees."
More than 1000 supplier facilities have shared their chemical inventories as well as storage and safety protocols as part of our CSD program.
"Through this process, weve identified more than 17 ,000 chemicals and applications."
These efforts contribute to a safer work environment for people across our supply chain.
"Zero waste Across our corporate operations, were reducing the amount of waste we generate and directing more toward recycling programs."
"In fiscal year 2021, recycling and composting efforts allowed us to achieve a waste diversion rate of 68 percent, limiting landfill waste from our global operations to about 15,000 metric tons.12 Our overall waste generated also remained low, in part due to COVID-related temporary closure of facilities."
"Last year, our Mesa, Arizona, data center became the second Apple facility to receive TRUE certification for zero waste, following the Prineville data center in 2020.13 Apple works with the Alliance for Water Stewardship and others to promote water stewardship that protects the health of water basins, including the Kunshan watershed in China.100+ Apple supplier facilities are zero waste verified 2M+ metric tons of waste redirected from landfill by supplier facilities as part of Apples Zero Waste Program Read more about our efforts to conserve resources in our 2022 Environmental Progress Report Weve partnered with our suppliers, recyclers, and waste solution providers to eliminate waste from our manufacturing processes."
"At the close of fiscal year 2021, more than 100 facilities had been zero waste verified nearly half of the supplier facilities that are part of our Zero Waste Program.14 All participating facilities across 12 countries can access resources including guidance on how to reduce waste and then reuse, recycle, or compost the waste they do create."
"And were seeing results: In fiscal year 2021, suppliers redirected 491,000 metric tons of waste from landfills, bringing the total to over 2 million metric tons since the programs inception the equivalent of eliminating more than 2.5 million square meters of landfill space."
"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 20Assessment and management The data we collect on chemicals and materials forms the foundation for key decisions that have an impact on our product designs, manufacturing processes, and approach to recycling and reuse."
"This data enables us to establish requirements for our suppliers, including those set out in our Regulated Substances Specification (RSS) and the Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials list ."
"These requirements provide clear guidelines on potentially harmful materials, including those that are restricted."
Our assessment system helps to ensure that only materials that meet our stringent requirements are used in Apple products.
"Atour Environmental Testing Lab, we evaluate the safety of our products and materials through chemical analyses."
Our chemists test materials for safety and monitor compliance with our specifications.
"In fiscal year 2021, we performed toxicological assessments on 1000 new materials to proactively evaluate and eliminate potentially harmful substances from our products."
"Both the data we gather on chemicals and our rigorous assessments allow us to make informed decisions and manage chemicals, forthe safety of those who use, make, and recycle our products."
"Innovation The work we do in mapping, assessing, and managing the chemicals within our supply chain underpins our innovations."
"We rely on detailed information on the material properties, including toxicological data and environmental performance characteristics."
"We also look Comprehensive chemical mapping Understanding chemical ingredients leads to better materials for Apple products Through our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) program, manufacturers share chemical ingredients used to make materials with Apple."
"With FMD data, Apple evaluates the chemicals in materials against restrictions."
"Data helps Apple suppliers manage chemicals when making Apple products Information on how chemicals are used, how theyre stored, and how employees are protected is shared with Apple by suppliers through our Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) program."
"CSD data informs and prioritizes supplier engagement, helping to ensure rigorous chemical management practices and adoption of safer alternatives."
Apple customers benefit from use of products made with safer ingredients The FMD and CSD programs help support creation of best-in-class products in a responsible manner for our customers.
"Mapping chemicals Mapping chemicals throughout product throughout product development leads to development leads to better, better, safer productssafer products Read more about our commitment to using safermaterials to create safer products in our 2022 Environmental Progress Reportat how these materials are used at each point in the product life cycle, from design, to manufacturing, to end-of-life."
This allows us to seek out and support the development of safer chemistries that have an impact on each phase and contribute to continually improving the overall safety of our products and processes.
"Since the late 1990s, we have diligently identified and removed potentially harmful chemicals from our products, such as brominated flame retardants, beryllium, mercury, and lead."
"Were also driving the use of safer process chemicals in our supply chain: Since 2018, all our final assembly sites have used only safer alternative cleaners and degreasers."
"As we work toward minimizing potentially harmful chemistries in our products and processes, were making the transition to safer alternatives accessible to others through industry initiatives, partnerships, and standards with the hope of driving chemical safety across the industry."

"Were committed to being a leader in pay equity, providing all employees with annual opportunities for stock ownership in the company, and offering highly competitive pay thats in the top tier of each local market."
And we hold our leaders accountable by incorporating Apple values and key community initiatives into our executive short-term incentive plan.
Competitive pay Apple is committed to remaining a market leader in compensation through our highly competitive and equitable programs.
"In addition to our stock program and wide range of benefits we provide, we regularly review our competitive position to establish our leading starting pay rates in each local market."
"Apple stock ownership In 2015, we introduced our Stock Ownership Program, which was designed to reach employees who were not previously eligible for restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, including all of our retail and AppleCare teams."
"By the end of 2022, over $1.1 billion of RSU grants will have been awarded under this program, and the shares underlying the RSUs today would have an estimated value of over $3 billion (based on a share price of $130.06 as of June 16, 2022)."
"Apple is one of the few companies in the S&P 500, and the largest technology company, in which employees at all levels are eligible for RSU grants on an annual basis."
"In 2021, 150,000 employees were eligible for RSU grants and our Compensation Committee approved grants for 99% of those eligible."
"In most countries, employees also get discounts when purchasing Apple stock by participating in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)."
"Currently, 81 percent of eligible employees participate in the ESPP."
"ESG Modifier Beginning in 2021, the Compensation Committee incorporated the ESG Modifier into the Executive annual cash incentive program."
"The ESG Modifier is based on a holistic evaluation by the Compensation Committee of key accomplishments and actions taken during the year to advance our Apple values: accessibility, education, environment, inclusion and diversity, privacy, and supplier responsibility, and key community initiatives which were chosen because they represent long-standing, business-relevant environmental, social, and governance principles that reflect Apples commitment to promoting values-driven leadership."
"Pay equity Since 2017, Apple has achieved and maintained gender pay equity for our employees worldwide."
In the U.
"S., weve also achieved pay equity with respect to race and ethnicity as well as pay equity at the intersections of race and ethnicity with gender."
"* In addition to our pay equity commitment, our Inclusion and Diversity program (see page 23 ) supports growth, development, and engagement for team members of all backgrounds."
"We have a number of practices in place to support our commitment to pay equity, including: * Pay equity at the intersections of race and ethnicity with gender was achieved in 2022."
"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 28We encourage open and honest communication among team members, managers, and leadership as we seek to build a better work environment for all."
Another way team members can let us know how Apple is doing is to participate in surveys that we conduct regularly.
"These survey results are a great way for us to learn about whats going well and how we can do better in areas like career development, manager performance, and inclusivity, and teams are encouraged to create action plans based on the survey results."
"We conduct annual surveys for all Apple Store and AppleCare team members to listen to their views on topics like leadership, management, career development, performance, values, culture, and work environment."
And leaders from each organization use the survey insights to take steps to better support team members where they need it.
"Over the last two years in particular, we focused on listening to Apple Store and AppleCare employees as they were interacting most directly with customers during the pandemic and experiencing rapid change in how they worked to support those customers."
"For our early 2022 surveys, 76 percent of Apple Store team members and 73 percent of AppleCare team members participated."
"Annual compensation planning: During our annual compensation planning process, the People team uses analytics to assess promotion rates, performance ratings distribution, and pay metrics for women compared to men and, in the U."
"S., for underrepresented groups compared to non-underrepresented groups."
"Global compensation history policy: We dont ask candidates for salary history during the recruiting process, which has been our policy globally since 2019."
Our recruiters develop offers of employment based on the compensation of current Apple employees in similar roles using a tool developed specifically for this purpose.
"Engagement At Apple, we believe that open and honest communication among team members, managers, and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow, and succeed."
"Across all our teams, were always building on our long-standing commitment to creating an environment where people at every level of the company feel connected and supported."
Our goal is to listen and learn and to use those lessons to build an even better workplace for all.
"If team members have questions, feedback, or concerns, theyre encouraged to share them with their manager."
"If a team member is ever uncomfortable raising a particular issue with their manager, they can discuss it with any manager at Apple, their People Business Partner, People Support, or they can contact theBusiness Conduct team."
Pay equity at Apple Our pay equity review is global and covers 100 percent of our employees.
"We consider total compensation, including base salary, bonus, andstock."
1:1 gender pay equity globally 1:1 pay equity in the U.
S. by race and ethnicity 1:1 gender pay equity in every country 1:1 pay equity in the U.
"S. at the intersections of race and ethnicity and genderAnnual pay equity review: To maintain pay equity, we engage an independent third-party expert to build and run statistical models to assess and resolve any differences in total compensation on the basis of gender and, in the U."
"S., on the basis of race and ethnicity and at the intersections with gender."
"Job assessments: Apples dedicated compensation team regularly conducts comprehensive job title reviews to ensure that employees are in the correct job title, which is an important factor in determining pay."
We also continuously analyze market data to ensure that compensation guidelines for all roles remain competitive.
Empowering employees to support the causes they care about Our Employee Giving program provides opportunities for employees to contribute to the causes they care deeply about with the support of Apple.
"From volunteering to donations to smaller individual actions, Apple is committed to giving, hand in hand with our team members."

Apple has a no-retaliation policy.
Retaliation against anyone who comes forward with a concern or participates in an investigation is grounds for termination.
"We respect each team members right to form or join (or refrain from joining) organizations of their choice in a lawful manner without discrimination, retaliation, or harassment."
"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 29Workplace practices andpolicies Apples culture is built on treating everyone with dignity and respect, and this focus shapes how our colleagues engage with one another and with our customers and partners around the world."
Were also committed to respecting our team members rights as set out in our Human Rights Policy .
Equal employment opportunity Apple is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity.
"We take steps to provide equal opportunity for all applicants and employees, without regard to race, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, religion, creed, age (over 40), mental and physical disability, sex, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, military or protected Veteran status, an employees reproductive health decisions or those of their dependents, or on any other basis protected by law."

"This is designed to promote fairness and impartiality, in line with our values and policies."
The reviewer will consider any new i nformation t hat i ndicates t he decision may not have been in accordance with our policies a nd g uidelines.
"Non-employees and temporary workers In addition to our full-time employees, temporary workers and vendor services play an important role on our team."
"Our temporary workers generally p erform s imilar w ork as our full-time employees, as they are intended to augment t he Apple employee workforce under a short t o mid -term a ssignment."
A pproximately 6 percent of our U.
S. corporate workforce were temporary workers as of October 2021.
Temporary workers have the same opportunity to be considered as all other applicants to any Apple job posting whether that opportunity is a conversion of their current role or a role they found on our job site.
"And in our retail business, we have a strong record of hiring temporary workers as full- and part-time employees."
Our outsourced services with workers provided via vendors generally perform work that can be different from that performed by our permanent employees.
This workforce is intended to support business needs where specific skills are required and the vendors have the ability to scale with our varied business needs.
"Pay and benefits: For vendor services, pay rates are managed by the vendor."
"Various benefits, including but not limited to healthcare, are offered to these workers through their employer or staffing agencies."
"Vendors are also accountable to Apples Supplier Code of Conduct, which requires that our staffing agencies are compliant with all current local and national legislation and employment laws, including wage and benefits requirements, for their employees (see page 37 or People and Environment in Our Supply Chain )."
"Raising concerns: In many cases there are multiple avenues for non-Apple workers to report problems anonymously, including internal processes with their employer and the Apple Business Conduct Helpline (see page 72)."
"Performance: Vendor performance is reviewed and evaluated by the vendor management based on feedback sometimes received from Apple managers, Procurement, and/or Supplier Responsibility."
"Reporting a concern At Apple we believe strongly in a culture of open communication, mutual respect, and high ethical standards and we strive to do the right thing."
"It can be stressful if something at Apple has a negative effect on well-being, violates an Apple policy, or interferes with someones ability to do their best work."
There are several ways team members can report a concern: Managers: Talking to a manager is a good place to start.
A large part of their responsibility is to support their team members.
"If a team member is not comfortable bringing a concern to their manager, they can discuss it with any manager at Apple."
People Support: This dedicated team specializes in supporting Apple team members with work-related topics.
"They can answer questions, clarify a policy, or suggest resources or options to help resolve a problem."
"Business Conduct: Team members can contact the Business Conduct team via phone, email, or a third party."
They will review the concern and share it with the appropriate internal partners.
Read more on page 72 .
"People Business Partner: Team members can discuss the issue with their People Business Partner (PBP), particularly if its related to your team or organization."
"Team members are encouraged to raise their concerns in the way they feel most comfortable, internally or externally."
"In addition to the options above, they may also contact any of the government agencies or other external organizations that address employee and workplace concerns."
"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 30Protecting each others health At every stage of the pandemic, our first priority has always been the health of our teams, customers, and communities."
"That meant being one of the first companies to close our offices and retail stores, and finding innovative ways to connect with colleagues and customers virtually."
"Since 2020, weve continued our efforts and programs to support our people."
"We adopted CDC recommendations around up-to-date vaccinations, including booster doses."
"Apple also continued to pay our teams during temporary store and office closures, expanded our paid leave policies, and enhanced our policies and procedures for a safe work environment both in the office and in-store."
"To keep our teams informed, we deployed comprehensive resources with up-to-date COVID-19 information, including a dedicated platform for teams returning to the office."
"COVID-19 case support, implemented for all team members, included return-to-work guidance and contact tracing, with the utmost regard for employee privacy."
"We continue to offer special sick leave for employees with possible COVID-19 symptoms, as well as comprehensive health coverage."
"To continue to manage our response going forward, we created a dedicated pandemic response team in 2022 in addition to the cross-functional team that has been supporting and guiding our COVID response."
The new response team will support future pandemic planning and response.
"Innovating to support our customers Despite all of the pandemics challenges, we brought our hardware, software, and services into customers hands, helping them stay informed, connected, and entertained."
We also tailored our services to promote easy access to trusted information on COVID-19: launching a dedicated section on Apple News; prioritizing visibility of essential services locations including COVID-19 testing and vaccination locations on Apple Maps; offering a curated collection of telehealth apps on the App Store; and leveraging Siri to provide the latest COVID-19 guidance.
"To meet the extraordinary challenges of virtual education, we delivered new content and services for students, parents, and teachers to foster creativity and learning in a digital environment."
We worked with mobile carriers and school administrators to deliver iPad devices with cellular support for students in need.
"With our Apple Card Customer Assistance Program, we also offered customers the option to skip their monthly payments without incurring interest."
"Across many of our Apple Store locations, we were able to serve our customers needs through contactless pickup, express storefronts, and new online support."
"Our response to COVID-19 is still ongoing, and were committed to implementing health protocols and adjusting store operations as required based on available data and guidance from health officials."
"Apples COVID-19 response The health of our teams, customers, and communities continues to be our first priority."
Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 31Supporting people in our supply chain We are continuing to work together with our suppliers to help them ensure that every necessary precaution is taken to keep people safe at work.
"In 2020, we introduced an enhancement to our Code and Standards specifically addressing Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response (IDPR)."
"IDPR contains a set of new requirements resulting from our learnings during the pandemic, which will help our suppliers better prepare for and be ready to respond to an infectious disease outbreak at their facility."
"As part of the rollout of IDPR in fiscal year 2021, we conducted more than 200 onsite and remote specialized assessments to verify suppliers compliance with COVID-19 control protocols in order to drive improvement when necessary."
"We also continue to assess any existing gaps at supplier facilities, and identify opportunities to work with those in higher-risk areas to help make their facilities safer."
"This includes working with third-party suppliers to redesign and reconfigure factory floor plans where necessary, implementing flexible working hours to maximize interpersonal space, implementing enhanced deep cleaning protocols, and deploying masks and sanitizers."
"In fiscal year 2021, we also encouraged our suppliers employees to get vaccinated and boosted where available."
"We also partnered with NGOs to help further support supplier employees, as well as those working deeper in our supply chain, particularly those from vulnerable groups."
We worked with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) the worlds leading organization providing services to migrant workers to provide support to migrant workers impacted by the pandemic.
"With support from Apple, our long-time partner Pact, an international development organization, prepared and coordinated activities to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in several mining communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)."
"The initiative has reached more than 50,000 people through individual and group dialogues on COVID-19 prevention since the program began in December 2020."
"Giving back to our communities Apples company-wide response to the COVID-19 pandemic involved teams across the business, including product design, engineering, operations, packaging teams, suppliers, and more."
"At the beginning of the pandemic, when personal protective equipment was in short supply, we sourced through our supply chain and donated more than 30 million masks for healthcare workers worldwide."
We also launched a company-wide effort to produce and ship over 10 million face shields.
"These face shields were delivered to sites around the world, from New York Presbyterian Hospital in the U."
S. to the Ministry of Health in Zambia.
"Additionally, we have also donated over $10 million to the World Health Organizations COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund."
We also matched employee donations two-to-one to support COVID-19 response efforts worldwide.
"We awarded $10 million from our Advanced Manufacturing Fund to COPAN diagnostics, a market leader in sample collection kits, that rapidly accelerated their ability to supply sample collection kits to hospitals in the U."
S. for COVID-19 testing.
And our partnership with Product (RED) also supported COVID-19 response (see page 65).
Collaboration with our suppliers helps them make sure theyre taking every necessary precaution to keep people safe at work.
"In partnership with the White House Coronavirus Task Force and the CDC, we released an app and a website that guided Americans through a series of questions about their health and exposure to determine if they should seek care for COVID-19 symptoms, providing CDC recommendations on next steps, including guidance on social distancing and self -isolating, how to closely monitor symptoms, recommendations on testing, and when to contact a medical provider."
"And we collaborated with Google to create a new exposure notification system for global governments and health agencies, with user privacy and security central to its design, to help fight the pandemic."
Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 32Health and safety at Apple Were dedicated to protecting our team members and our customers everywhere we operate a responsibility COVID-19 has brought into even greater focus.
"At every stage of the pandemic, weve made decisions based on the latest local data and public health guidance, and we share lessons across our Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) teams globally so we can continuously improve our safety programs."
Protecting our people Were always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when theyre conducting business for Apple.
We abide by EHS requirements in every country where we operate and are dedicated to doing everything we can to support the safety and well-being of our global teams.
"Managing work-related hazards and risks To help ensure the safety of our workers and customers, we put procedures in place to identify workplace risks and mitigate possible hazards."
"We support and protect employees in lower hazard spaces, and we put risk- specific programs in place for those working in higher hazard environments, including safe systems of work, chemical management, laser safety, equipment and machinery safety, hazardous materials management, and electrical safety."
"Employees can request to have their workspaces individually inspected to review hazards and controls, including ergonomics evaluations."
"Apple implements a hierarchy of control for significant risks, which centers on elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment (PPE)."
"As one example, Apple EHS regularly assesses hazards at our research labs based on their chemical, equipment, laser, and other hazards."
"Approximately 9 percent of our labs are considered complex, meaning that they contain high-hazard processes and equipment."
These assessments help teams understand which EHS programs and controls must be put in place to mitigate risks.
"In 2021, Apple completed hazard assessments in over 2500 research labs globally."
Our EHS teams identify and provide team members with appropriate PPE for specific hazards.
This PPE is provided at no cost and with training on correct use.
"For example, our hearing conservation programs include evaluation and control of occupational exposures to noise, and hearing protection is available for processes, areas, and tasks with potential high noise exposures."
"Additionally, EHS conducts mandatory health checks for employees where theyre needed."
"We invest in new technologies as we continue to manage potential risks across our operations, including our Apple-owned manufacturing sites."
"Our standards, programs, trainings, procedures, and other safeguards are managed by trained EHS professionals, and where required, we also translate EHS procedures into local languages for our team members."
"Risks identified from incidents, injuries, and non-routine events are addressed expeditiously to identify and implement appropriate corrective and preventative actions, and we integrate our learnings into future program development and training."
"Lessons learned are routinely communicated across Apples EHS team and potentially affected operations, and they are used to inform updates to existing policies and procedures."
"Employees and managers can report incidents, near-misses, and observations including newly identified hazards and risksthrough an internal iOS app."
"Incident responses are addressed by Apples EHS team through a consistent process that connects employees with care and support, while identifying corrective actions where appropriate to prevent future occurrences."
Waste management Apple is committed to minimizing resource use and the associated generation of non- hazardous or hazardous waste.
"Where possible, Apple implements a waste hierarchy of prevention, waste reduction at the source, reuse of materials, recycling, energy recovery, and landfilling as a last resort."
"We maintain our commitment to the safe and responsible management of hazardous waste, both onsite and offsite."
Any facility that does not meet our requirements is replaced by another approved waste management facility.
We made progress in 2021 at sites around the world:U.
"S.: Thirteen of the Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) we utilize in the U."
"S. were audited in 2021 to confirm that the waste is treated, recycled, or incinerated within the governing safety standards for health and the environment."
"Eight disposal facility reviews were completed by vendors under Apple management, and we reviewed five other sites via third-party audit reports."
"At one of our major research labs in Santa Clara Valley, the empty container management program resulted in a 3 percent reduction of lab debris for hazardous waste streams."
"United Kingdom: Through an internal initiative to further strengthen waste management, product site-specific waste initiatives achieved a 97 percent diversion from landfill and a 0.4 tonnes of waste/1002, both exceeding requirements."
Ireland: The Cork Campus is ECVP 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill Certified annually and has had no material landfilled in the past five years.
"Ergonomics In 2021, we continued to support our global team members working from home office, Apple office, and non-office settings."
The Apple ergonomics program is heavily focused on preventative measures to reduce the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs).
"This includes ergonomics training sessions for our team members and providing input into the purchase or design of work equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure that they meet ergonomic standards to provide the best levels of efficiency, comfort, health, and safety for anyone using them."
"Our Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 33ergonomics trainings and self-assessment support are aimed at creating an awareness of ergonomic risk factors for WMSDs, how to prevent them, and how to proactively request for adjustments to workstations."
"We completed over 10,000 individual support requests for our team members working from home, along with those who returned to Apple offices and Apple Store locations."
"Support included tailored guidance and feedback, equipment recommendations, and 1:1 virtual or in-person assessments."
"In addition, over 3000 employees participated in various training sessions."
"Our industrial, warehouse, and other non- office operations teams were supported with approximately 400 ergonomic risk assessments and 76 lab screenings."
"The assessments evaluated risk factors such as repetition, force, posture, and duration, while reviewing the interaction of the team member with new machines, equipment, work processes, and workspaces."
"Emergency preparedness and response Beyond COVID-19, we supported the response to dozens of crisis events in 2021, including fires, severe weather, and civil unrest."
Our responses focused on the safety of our employees and business continuity.
"We activated 31 crisis management teams (CMTs) to manage the most severe events, and 120 additional incidents were supported without full CMTs.All team members can sign up for Apples Emergency Alert system, enabling them to be notified of local emergencies and to indicate whether they are safe or need help."
Disaster supplies are available at our facilities.
"All Apple campuses with over 1000 employees have Facility Response and Recovery Plans, which provide a comprehensive approach to the safety and support of our employees while minimizing business interruption."
Site-specific Emergency Response Plans have been implemented globally.
"These plans are communicated to all employees, and trainings and drills are held at least annually."
"And our employees are trained in emergency response, allowing them to react quickly while supporting the safety of our team members and customers."
"In 2021, we completed over 200 emergency response drills, which were supported by 2700 trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) members."
"We expect to increase the frequency of these drills, depending on COVID-19 restrictions."
"With the care and support of our employees and customers in mind, we deployed Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) stations across our global retail stores in 2021."
"And to ensure that our team members could effectively use this new tool, we provided AED training for our team members."
All campuses and key sites have disaster supplies to match localized risks.
"As Apples footprint grows, sites are evaluated and supplies are added as needed."
"As one example, in 2021, we launched earthquake preparedness campaigns for employees across the western United States and Japan."
"We conducted outreach to provide employees with information, tools, and resources, and we held drills in some offices."
Were always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when theyre conducting business for Apple.
"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our P eople Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 34EHS management systems To provide a safe and sustainable environment for our teams, our EHS programs are built to share information about risks, requirements, and expectations for all workers."
"Our EHS policy outlines our commitment to workplace safety and environmental stewardship, and it establishes the principles that integrate effective EHS practices into all aspects of our business."
The EHS policy is communicated through mandatory training for all new employees and through our internal EHS website.
"Apples EHS leadership team, including Apples EHS director, is responsible for establishing priorities, determining annual work plans, and assigning resources to implement high-quality services in all geographies where we operate."
"Certifications Our operations in Cork, Ireland, are certified to ISO14001, an international standard for environmental management systems."
"And Apples Taiwan Technology Center is certified to ISO45001 for occupational health and safety management systems, and working toward ISO14001 certifications in 2022."
Inspections Our EHS inspections serve to both identify potential safety hazards and ensure that were following our internal processes to mitigate them.
"To support this work, Apple formalized our existing inspections program by launching enterprise-wide software, which allows users to create mobile inspections and then carry out inspections and safety compliance audits."
"The tool also captures observations, findings, and corrective actions."
"Our inspections tool was deployed globally to 1050 users across various retail and corporate locations, including Apple Store locations, general office spaces, R&D labs, kitchens and cafes, data centers, construction sites, and laser labs."
"Training In 2021, Apple employees completed 68,249 hours of safety training."
Apple currently offers 304 safety courses or trainings to our employees.
Our EHS management systems are designed to provide a safe environment for teams across Apple.

"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 36The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards outline our requirements for our suppliers in the areas of labor and human rights, health and safety, environment, ethics, and management systems."
"Since 2005, the Code and Standards have been updated annually, are published on our website in 15 languages, and communicated to our suppliers."
"The requirements in our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards and the due diligence we conduct across our supply chain align with internationally recognized labor and human rights standards, including those of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as industry-leading health and safety organizations."
People are at the center of everything we do and every decision we make.
"While the pandemic has changed some of the ways we do our work, our values remain the same."
"The partnerships we have cultivated over the years throughout our supply chain have allowed us to continue to make significant progress in upholding the highest standards of labor and human rights and worker health and safety, and make unprecedented achievements in climate action and the stewardship of natural resources."
"Yet, as proud as we are of our progress, we know each year and each achievement is just a stepping stone in our continuous pursuit of better."

"Holding ourselves and our suppliers to the highest standards As described on page 10 , our Human Rights Policy outlines how we treat everyone, including our customers, employees, business partners, and people at every level of our supply chain."
We take a very broad view of our supply chain (see diagram on page 38 ) and the responsibility that comes with it.
"We consider our supply chain to include everything that goes into designing, building, delivering, supporting, and recycling of Apple products, aswell as our retail stores and all of the services and operations that are part of our supply chain ecosystem."
Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 37in the procurement and product development cycles.
"Since fiscal year 2020, 9 percent of prospective suppliers evaluated for Code- related risks have been prevented from entering our supply chain for being unable or unwilling to meet our Code and Standards."
"Once new suppliers are awarded Apple business, we begin the process of helping them quickly get up to speed on our requirements through our supplier onboarding process."
"In 2021, we expanded our onboarding process to engage new suppliers at an even earlier stage in their working relationship with Apple."
We also extend our support to help prospective suppliers correct compliance issues found during the procurement process even when the supplier is not awarded Apples business at no cost to the participating companies.
"Since 2020, 68 percent of companies that were not awarded Apple business elected to join this voluntary program, helping to protect people and the planet beyond the reach of our business and supply chain."
"Supplier engagement and accountability We take a broad, comprehensive approach to engaging with our suppliers to confirm that our standards are met."
One of the tools that we employ are assessments.
"Assessments, also known as audits, are one of several methods we use to measure compliance with our requirements."
"These independent, third-party assessments, which take place onsite at supplier facilities, provide a snapshot of a suppliers performance."
"However, when combined with regular engagement with supplier teams, mandated reporting, and listening directly to hundreds of thousands of supplier employees about their workplace experiences, our rigorous supplier assessments provide a clear measure of their performance in upholding our Code and Standards."
"In the 2021 reporting period, 1177 assessments were conducted in 52 countries."
"This included 886 Code of Conduct assessments and 291 smelter and refiner assessments.20 Since 2007, Apple-managed assessments have covered 94 percent of our direct manufacturing spend."
"The Apple Supply Chain 3 million+ people Thousands of businesses and facilities52 countries Our People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report (page 99) provides a detailed overview of progress in our supply chain, including efforts to identify, mitigate, prevent, and remedy human rights risks as outlined by the Business and Human Rights Due Diligence process set forth in the UNGPs."
"We work closely with many experts across Apple from product and services designers to facility managers to evaluate and update our Code and Standards annually to address emerging risks, incorporate new legal requirements and industry best practices, and reflect the needs of supplier employees in a dynamic operating environment."
"We engage with a range of stakeholders, including rights- holders, civil society organizations, academic experts, and program partners, to ensure that our Code and Standards reflect current internationally recognized labor, human rights, health and safety, and environmental standards."
"Upholding our values from the start We work across our business to implement our standards from the earliest stages of product design and development from the suppliers we choose to work with, to the materials in our products, to the processes and equipment we use to make them."

Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 38been taken to prevent a reoccurrence.
We prohibit retaliation of any kind against supplier employees who participate in our assessments.
"Our goal is to work together with suppliers to help them improve their management systems, rather than to simply remove them from our supply chain without helping them correct the issues we have discovered."
"In the event that a supplier is unwilling or unable to improve their operations to meet our requirements, they risk removal from our supply chain."
"Since 2009, we have directed the removal of 24 manufacturing supplier facilities and 170 smelters and refiners from our supply chain for being unwilling or unable to sufficiently improve their operations to meet our requirements."
Results of our assessments are detailed in our People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report beginning on page 91.
"A responsibility that grows with our business As Apples business continues to grow and expand to new areas, we adapt our supplier engagement model accordingly."
"This includes continuing to expand our scope to conduct independent, third-party assessments of a growing number of suppliers that support our business outside of manufacturing."
"Last year, we increased our engagement and expanded the application of our Code and Standards to suppliers supporting newer areas of Apples business, including those that work with our content services like Apple TV+ and AppleFitness+."
Supplier employees at Final Assembly in the U.
S.How we stay engaged with suppliers widely used by the industry.
A total of 99 RBA VAP assessments were completed in fiscal year 2021 at Apple supplier sites.
"If we uncover non-compliance in the course of any assessment or engagement, we take prompt action so that suppliers not only correct and remedy the issue, but make meaningful, long-term changes to their systems and processes."
"We do this through a Corrective Action Plan (CAP), during which 30-, 60-, and 90-day check-ins with Apple are required."
"We then conduct our Corrective Action Verification (CAV) process to verify that all corrective actions have been successfully implemented, and necessary steps have Code of conduct assessments Specialized assessments Investigations Capability buildingOngoing trainingEarly engagement These assessments also include unannounced assessments and unannounced visits in response to workers grievances and allegations, or to verify risks at supplier facilities based on predictive analytics."
"In fiscal year 2021, 211 unannounced assessments and investigations were conducted where the supplier facility was provided no advance notice of our arrival."
This is nearly double the number conducted in 2020.
"In addition to third-party Code of Conduct assessments, we require many of our suppliers to also undergo the Responsible Business Alliances (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP), a facility-wide, third-party assessment Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 39Partnerships that accelerate progress We are collaborating with industry associations, civil society organizations, and multi- stakeholder initiatives around the world to promote best practices, to listen to and learn from others perspectives and experiences, and to scale innovative solutions, helping everyone to achieve progress at a more rapid pace."
See page 32 of the People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report for more detail on the organizations we work with.
Labor and human rights in the supply chain People come first in everything we do.
"Our commitment to protecting the people in our supply chain has been unwavering, anchored by a simple set of beliefs: People deserve to be treated with dignity and to know their rights."
"They should be able to speak up if those rights are not being respected and to know and expect that when they do, we will listen and act."
Were committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain.
"We are committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain just like we do for our team members, customers, and other partners and more broadly, to working with others to share our tools and the lessons weve learned, and to empowering everyone to achieve progress more rapidly."
"Listening to workers Effective grievance channels, ongoing worker management communications, and supplier employee feedback are essential to ensuring respect for worker rights and maintaining safe and healthy workplaces."
"Whether through social dialogue and formal employee representation, workplace satisfaction surveys, anonymous hotlines, focus groups, or interviews during annual assessments, the feedback we receive directly from supplier employees helps us ensure labor and human rights are respected throughout our global supply chain."
"We also use this feedback to address emerging risks, improve rights training for supplier employees and supplier management, and to continually strengthen our Code and Standards."
"Rights awareness: We believe that protection starts with rights awareness, and since 2008, more than 23.6 million supplier employees have been trained on their workplace rights."
"Under our Code and Standards, suppliers are required to provide employees with training on their workplace rights."
"This training is generally conducted during new employee orientation, and covers international labor standards, local labor laws, environmental health and safety, and the protections required by our Code and Standards Feedback channels: Supplier employee interviews are an important part of every assessment conducted."
"Each year, we interview tens of thousands of supplier employees in their local language and without their managers present, to determine whether or not their experience on the job aligns with auditors observations during assessments."
"In fiscal year 2021, despite the ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we interviewed 87,626 workers in our supply chain over 35,000 more than were interviewed in the previous fiscal year."
"Our Code and Standards require effective worker feedback channels, including grievance mechanisms, at all supplier sites."
"We also provide third-party anonymous hotlines, which are also available to our employees (see page 72 ), and the ability to contact the Apple Environment and Supply Chain Innovation (ESCI) team directly at any time and in any language."
"When an issue is raised, we require supplier management to immediately investigate and to resolve the issue in a timely manner."
"In 2021, we launched a grievance hotline awareness campaign, and its initial rollout resulted in a 22 percent increase in utilization of these third-party hotlines."
"The reports we received from supplier employees via hotlines in 2021 included issues related to wages and benefits, employee relations, amenities at supplier facilities, workforce stability, and health and safety."
"In each case, we investigated and worked directly with the suppliers to drive improvement and correct any compliance issues found."
"Suppliers implemented a number of actions as a result of supplier employee feedback through these Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 40channels, including improvements to working hours, resignation processes, timing of bonuses, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE)."
"Workplace satisfaction: In addition to interviews and grievance channels, we also engage with supplier employees to understand their overall workplace satisfaction."
"In 2021, we anonymously surveyed 264,963 supplier employees in 191 facilities across Greater China, India, Ireland, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, UK, U."
"S., and Vietnam about their workplace experiences nearly double the number of supplier employees surveyed last fiscal year."
"As a result, suppliers took 3944 actions, including better commute options, increasing wages and bonuses, offering better food variety, and skill development opportunities for entry-level managers."
"Responsible labor recruitment Our Code and Standards, and the protections they provide, apply equally to all workers, regardless of a persons job, geographic location, or how they enter our supply chain and this commitment begins even before a worker ever enters our supply chain."
This includes zero tolerance for forced labor.
We implement strict policies and procedures with our suppliers to protect workers in our supply chain from forced labor.
"This includes selecting suppliers for assessments based on factors, such as their geographic location, which may put them at higher risk of forced labor violations, as well as their previous performance and/or history of violations or allegations."
"Suppliers may also receive additional specialized assessments based on the nature of their business or employee population, such as those that employ Foreign Contract Workers, and those located in higher risk migration corridors."
Our Code and Standards also require that all supplier employees have an effective mechanism to report grievances.
"In addition, we provide third-party anonymous hotlines and the ability to contact the Apple Environment and Supply Chain Innovation (ESCI) team directly at any time and in any language."
"When an issue is raised, supplier management is required to promptly investigate and to resolve the issue in a timely manner."
"We strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor throughout our worldwide supply chain and look for evidence of it in every supplier assessment we conduct, including unannounced assessments."
"Last year, we conducted more than 1100 assessments, and found no instances where anyone was forced to work in our supply chain."
"We did discover two cases in Taiwan in which people paid recruitment fees to secure their job, which is a violation of our Code."
"We required the supplier to directly repay their employees in full, and verified repayment through a third-party auditor."
"The payment of recruitment fees, withholding an employees passport or personal identity documents, or restricting an employees freedom of movement are Core Violations of our Code and Standards the most serious level of Code violations."
"If we discover workers have paid recruitment fees at any point on their employment journey to an Apple supplier, we require supplier management to take prompt action to provide remedy to those affected by directly repaying their workers for any and all fees, even if the supplier was unaware that their employees had paid recruitment fees."
"From 2008 through fiscal year 2021, our suppliers have repaid $33.2 million in recruitment fees directly to 37 ,322 workers."
"Finally, in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), we expanded our Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit to more than 39 additional supplier facilities in 10 countries, reaching nearly 77 ,000 workers globally, with 66 percent of those working on Apple production lines.23.6M supplier employees trained on their rights since 2008 352,589 supplier employees directly engaged about their workplace experiences, through interviews and satisfaction surveys 220,000 supplier employees reached by grievance hotline awareness campaign Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 41How we work to prevent forced labor in our supply chain Apple has zero tolerance for forced labor."
"In the more than 50 countries and regions where our suppliers operate, we have teams of experts, including independent third parties, who monitor our suppliers and put in place industry-leading procedures to help ensure that no one is forced to work."
"Our comprehensive policies start before we even sign a contract with suppliers, and we are consistently raising the bar."
1 We set the highest standards.
Eliminating forced labor begins with setting and maintaining the highest standards.
Our standards often go above and beyond legal requirements to protect people from forced labor risks.2 We engage early.
"To address forced labor risks at its roots, we know that our work has to begin before people enter our supply chain.3 We hold suppliers accountable."
"Once weve implemented thorough preventative measures, independent, third-party assessments verify that our suppliers are meeting our standards."
Looking for evidence of forced labor is part of every supplier assessment.
"If we find any violations of our Code and Standards, we take swift action to remedy the issue and improve their operations.4 We track progress and report transparently."
Consistent improvement requires transparency and accountability.
"Since 2007, we have been publishing reports on our efforts across all of our work to transparently share our progress and challenges.5 We regularly engage and partner withstakeholders."
"Engagement with stakeholders and rights holders is critical to accountability, ensuring were taking action where its needed, and to achieving rapid progress."
Aligning with international frameworks.
"Apple policies and our supplier requirements align with international labor and human rights standards, including those of the International Labour Organization, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), and the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development."
"The Apple Human Rights Policy Our Human Rights Policy outlines how we treat everyone, including our customers, employees, business partners, and the people across every level of our supply chain."
"Read the Apple Human Rights Policy The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards Our supplier requirements contain strict standards for responsible labor recruitment, and apply to all suppliers, protecting workers globally."
"We go above and beyond legal requirements in many places by strictly prohibiting labor recruitment in regions where we cannot conduct adequate due diligence and by maintaining a zero recruitment fees policy, because we believe no one should pay to secure a job."
Read the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards Thorough mapping informs our strategy.
An effective strategy requires deep understanding of our supply chain.
"To date, we have mapped over 1000 labor recruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across 32countries."
A leading strategy requires leading tools.
"The Apple Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit, developed in partnership with the International Organization for Migration, provides suppliers and their labor agencies with easy-to-use tools that help them effectively manage and report data, mitigating forced labor risks before people even enter our supply chain."
"In addition to providing hands-on training, we are making these tools openly available for others to use."
Awareness is power.
We require our suppliers to provide their employees with training on their workplace rights on their first day on the job.
"This helps to ensure that every person is aware of their rights and what to do if theyre not being respected, which includes the ability to anonymously contact Apple directly."
"Foreign Contract Workers, who make up a very small percentage of people in our supply chain, also receive training prior to leaving their home country, as well as upon arriving in their destination country."
"To date, our suppliers have provided workplace rights training to over 23.6 million people."
"In addition, last year we directly engaged with over 350,000 people in our supply chain to learn more about their workplace experience."
Investing in consistent improvement.
"Through our new Supplier Employee Development Fund, were investing $50M to expand programs designed to continue to improve the rights training experience, worker voice platforms, and supplier employee education opportunities."
A close look.
"We regularly conduct independent, third-party assessments, including surprise assessments, of our suppliers, verifying compliance with over 500 points across our standards."
This includes an extensive document review to be sure all hiring and personnel records are in place and accurate.
"In addition to specialized forced labor assessments for at-risk suppliers, we also require many suppliers to participate in facility-wide assessments, such as the Validated Assessment Program, to verify performance across the suppliers entire business."
"In the event that we find gaps in a suppliers compliance or capabilities, we require them to implement a Corrective Action Plan."
"To date, our assessments have covered 94 percent of our direct manufacturing spend."
We investigate every report.
"In addition to thoroughly assessing our suppliers performance in upholding our standards, we also receive reports from the press, governments, civil society, and people in our supply chain, and we encourage the public to report concerns via https://www.apple.com/uk/supplier-responsibility/."
"We investigate every report, and frequently have Apple teams onsite within 24 hours."
Swift action and steep penalties.
Forced labor in any form is a Core Violation (the most serious violation level) of our requirements.
"If a Core Violation is discovered, the suppliers CEO is notified and the supplier is immediately placed on probation, pending the successful completion of a Corrective Action Plan."
"Probation can include no new projects, no new business, and termination of existing business."
"In addition to commercial penalties, if a supplier is unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they risk removal from our supply chain."
"Since 2009, we have directed the removal of 24 manufacturing supplier facilities and 170 smelters and refiners for failure to meet our requirements."
Action this year.
"In FY21, across more than 1100 assessments, we found no instances where anyone was forced to work in our supply chain."
We did find two cases where employees of the same supplier in Taiwan paid recruitment fees.
"Per our requirements, the supplier directly repaid their employees for those fees."
"To date, our suppliers have directly repaid $33.2M in recruitment fees to 37 ,322 of their employees."
"People and Environment in Our Supply ChainAnnual Progress Report Published annually since 2007 (formerly known as the Supplier Responsibility Progress Report), this report contains a detailed accounting of our progress, challenges, and future plans across all areas of our supplier requirements."
"Read our Annual Progress Report Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking andSlavery Disclosure This disclosure is a specialized filing that focuses specifically on our efforts to prevent and address forced labor risks throughout our supply chain, and includes our due diligence process for our entire business, including manufacturing, materials and goods sourcing, and services."
"This report also demonstrates our alignment with the UNGPs and meets regulatory requirements in the UK, Australia, and California."

"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 42Health, safety, and wellness Everyone has the right to a safe and healthy workplace."
"We work from the earliest stages of product design to ensure that the materials, machines, and processes used in the manufacturing of our products prioritize the health and safety of the people working in our supply chain."
"Building a culture of safety Among many topics, our Code and Standards cover the safe handling of chemicals, emergency preparedness, health and safety permits, living and working conditions, and incident management."
Health and safety is also an important part of every assessment we conduct.
"Any instances of noncompliance with our Code and Standards during an assessment are addressed through customized Corrective Action Plans, online training materials, and capability building with EHS experts in order to improve their future performance."
"In 2021, we began development of a safety culture guide to help suppliers cultivate a deeper, more sustainable culture of safety in their facilities."
"Health and wellness Beyond keeping people in our supply chain safe, were committed to creating workplaces where people can thrive."
This means giving our supplier employees the tools and resources to improve their physical and mental health and well-being.
"Since 2017, weve helped make health education and resources available to more than 2.95 million supplier employees on topics such as reproductive health, disease prevention, and nutrition."
"In 2021, we conducted a needs assessment to give supplier employees an opportunity to share their feedback, and we are updating our resources with those results in mind."
Safeguarding health through safer chemistry Our commitment starts with setting and upholding strict material safety standards that often go beyond regulatory requirements in order to protect human health and the environment.
"These are outlined in our Code and Standards and our Regulated Substances Specification (RSS), and are derived from international laws or directives, regulatory agencies, eco-label requirements, and environmental standards."
"We then go further, by intentionally designing our products and manufacturing processes to use safer materials, as well as verifying that the correct health and safety protocols are being used across our supply chain."
And were making an impact beyond our supply chain by working with others to help make the use of safer materials the industry norm.
We received the U.
"S. Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Safer Choice Partner of the Year Award for the second year in a row, in recognition of our leadership in safer chemistry."
"Were also a founding signatory of the Clean Electronics Production Networks (CEPN) Toward Zero Exposure program, a public platform for companies across the electronics industry to commit to and report on their efforts to eliminate workers exposure to hazardous chemicals in manufacturing.1000+ supplier facilities disclosed chemical and safety data, representing the majority of Apples direct spend 2nd Year receiving U."

"Responsible materials sourcing From mapping our supply chain and assessing risk, to conducting independent, third-party audits, engaging with civil society and industry, and investing heavily in innovation, upholding standards in the sourcing of materials is a responsibility that requires a strategic, comprehensive approach."
"As we make progress toward our goal to use only recycled and renewable minerals and materials in our products and packaging, we continue to source primary materials including tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG), and other minerals, such as cobalt responsibly, while working to improve conditions in and around mining communities."
"Our Responsible Sourcing of Materials Standard, part of our Code and Standards, covers all primary and recycled materials, including advanced and bio-based materials."
"Our standard aligns with leading international standards, including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developments Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Due Diligence Guidance)."
"Every year, as part of our commitment to transparency, we publish a list of identified 3TG, cobalt, and for the second year lithium smelters and refiners in our supply chain."
"100% of identified 3TG, cobalt and lithium smelters and refiners participated in independent, third-party audits A placer miner holds gold sourced from Alaska and the Yukon as part of the Salmon Gold Project."

"In 2021, all identified cobalt and lithium refiners key materials used to make batteries for all Apple products participated in OECD-aligned independent, third-party audits covering labor, human rights, and environmental policies, as well as management systems."
"We continue to conduct additional due diligence and carry out OECD-aligned independent, third-party audits on other battery materials such as graphite, nickel, and copper."
"We also map other minerals in our products such as mica, copper, graphite, and nickel, and assess new materials for compliance with our requirements prior to production."
"In fiscal year 2021, we conducted due diligence on 26 recycled or bio-based materials to verify that their sourcing pathways met Apples standards and expectations."
"Also in fiscal year 2021, 100 percent of the identified 3TG, cobalt, and lithium smelters and refiners in our supply chain have participated in independent, third-party audits to assess and identify a broad range of risks, including social, environmental, human rights, and governance risks."
"This marks seven consecutive years of 100 percent compliance for 3TG, six consecutive years for cobalt, and two consecutive years for lithium."
"In the event that a smelter or refiner is unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we remove them from our supply chain."
"Since 2009, we have directed the removal of 163 3TG and 7 cobalt smelters and refiners from our supply chain."
"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 44Education and professional development Through our global supply chain, we create opportunities for people around the world, including by helping to close skills gaps in manufacturing, and by helping to prepare workers across our supply chain for the jobs of today and tomorrow."
"Supplier Employee Development Fund and Apple Education Hub In March 2022, we announced a $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund to amplify worker voice and expand access to learning and skill development opportunities to more people in our supply chain and surrounding communities."
"Part of this commitment will support new and expanded labor programs reaching more than 3.5 million supplier employees in over 40 countries, aided by our strategic partners, including the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM)."
"As part of this fund, we also launched the Apple Education Hub, informed by our previous supplier employee learning and development programs, which 5 million supplier employees have taken advantage of since 2008."
"In partnership with local educational institutions and NGOs, the Apple Education Hub will provide a scalable solution through virtual- first learning, to promote and develop the skills necessary for the future of work in our supply chain and surrounding communities."
With initial programming to begin in the Apples $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund will expand access to learning opportunities and skills development for people across its supply chain.
"Using our purchasing power for good For Apple, our work to make our company more inclusive extends to how we choose the businesses we work with."
"When contracting with suppliers, we use our purchasing power to increase diversity in our supply chain and change outdated norms that hurt those who are underrepresented in their field or industry."
"Apples award-winning Supplier Diversity program, established in 1993, actively engages suppliers from historically underrepresented communities."
"We have policies and procedures that require diverse supplier participation during early-stage sourcing, key performance indicators to measure company success, and diversity awareness trainings for our global sourcing team members and related Apple business units."
"In 2016, Apple was the first Silicon Valleybased company to be invited into the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR) in recognition of our long-standing commitment to promoting diversity within our supplier base."
BDR celebrates corporations that achieved spending of at least $1 billion with minority- and woman-owned businesses.
"In calendar year 2021, Apple spent over $7.1 billion with diverse suppliers around the world."
Our Supplier Diversity program offers support to participating suppliers and seeks active engagement in industry diversity leadership activities.
"For example, supplier development has been a long-standing commitment within Apples supply chain, which is facilitated internally and externally."
"Externally, we partner with major universities to provide executive development and capacity building to key diverse suppliers."
And were proud to have supported Michigan State University and Howard University on creating their first programs for diverse supplier development.
A highlight of 2021 was that for the first time we engaged diverse suppliers in North America in manufacturing accessories for some of Apples most well- known products.
Were also promoting diversity in the companies with which we do business.
"For example, our agreements with our primary construction suppliers require the reporting of their efforts to include diverse subcontractors on all Apple- relatedprojects."
"As a result of our efforts, we were chosen as Corporation of the Year by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) in October 2021."
"This award is NMSDCs highest honor to a major corporation for the utilization of ethnic minority- owned suppliers, specifically those with Asian-Indian, Asian-Pacific, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous owners."
"Appendix Governance Communities Suppliers Customers Our People Environment Introduction Apples 2022 ESG Report 45Apple helps suppliers rapidly accelerate renewable energy use around theworld In April 2022, Apple announced that its suppliers more than doubled their use of clean power over the last year, with over 10 gigawatts operational today out of nearly 16 gigawatts in total commitments in the coming years."
"In 2021, these renewable projects avoided 13.9 million metric tons of carbon emissions."
The projects online today will support greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to removing 3 million cars from the road for one year.
Apple is constantly working with its global supply chain to accelerate and support its transition to clean energy.
"As of March 2022, 213 of the companys major manufacturing partners have pledged to power all Apple production with renewable electricity across 25 countries."
The dozens of new commitments announced this year will accelerate progress toward Apples 2030 goal to become carbon neutral across its entire supply chain.

"S., China, India, and Vietnam, more than 100,000 supplier employees will participate in new learning opportunities by 2023 from leadership training and technical certifications, to classes on coding, robotics, and advanced manufacturing fundamentals."
Internal leadership and technical programs We work consistently to provide meaningful educational opportunities that enrich supplier employees workplace experiences and provide opportunities to improve career paths.
"Over the past five years, more than 5000 students have participated in our Line Leader, Automation Technician, and general apprenticeship programs."
These programs give participants the skills they need to pursue opportunities in highly technical roles.
"In 2021, 5883 supplier employees at 18 supplier sites participated in technical training, including programs on robotics, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines, and mobile device repair."
"Coding Since 2017, weve offered training to supplier employees on Apples Swift coding language a skill that is in high demand."
"In 2021, we continued to build on feedback from students and suppliers to refine our curriculum by adding more opportunities for virtual learning while maintaining the quality and consistency of the programs."
Environment Human rights and environmental protection are inextricably linked.
And were taking action accordingly.
"As we build products that enrich the lives of people around the world, we have a profound responsibility to do so in a way that minimizes our resource use while protecting the local environments and communities where we and our suppliers operate."
"We work with our suppliers to help us address our environmental commitments, including our goal to become carbon neutral by 2030 across our entire product footprint."
"Our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program and Supplier Clean Energy Program both address direct and indirect emissions in our supply chain, while our Supplier Clean Water and Zero Waste programs help to reduce resource usage."
"In addition, our Code contains strict environmental protections, which require our suppliers to understand and take active steps to reduce their environmental impact while also becoming better stewards of the resources we all share and the communities in which we operate."
"Specifically, our Code addresses the management of regulated substances, stormwater, wastewater, air emissions, waste, and noise, as well as pollution prevention, resource reduction, and obtaining necessary environmental permits."
"More detail about our environment work in the supply chain is covered on page 13 , as well as in People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report and the Environmental Progress Report ."

"Our products and services help our customers learn, express their creativity, exercise their ingenuity, communicate privately and securely, and share information globally, whether by text message, audio, or sign language over FaceTime video."
Designed for privacy Our products and services are built with innovative privacy technologies and techniques designed to minimize how much of your data Apple or anyone else can access.
They contain features designed and implemented over decades to protect customers privacy and give them control over their information.
"Safari was the first browser to block third- party cookies by default as far back as 2003, and in 2017, Safari added Intelligent Tracking Prevention to further limit tracking while still enabling websites to function normally."
"Random identifiers ensure that routes customers take and the places they search in Maps are not associated with their Apple ID, and Messages and FaceTime are end-to- end encrypted, so Apple cant eavesdrop on user communications."
"Siri was designed from the very beginning in 2011 to not associate the things that users say to Siri with their Apple ID, but instead uses a random identifier generated when a user first enables Siri."
"That has remained the same since then, and in 2021, with newly introduced on-device speech recognition, the audio of users Siri requests is processed right on their iPhone or iPad by default."
"Throughout the App Store ecosystem, we continue to add innovative new features that advance user privacy even further."
"Privacy Nutrition Labels require developers, including Apple, to report their data collection and privacy practices in a standardized format."
And App Tracking Transparency requires developers to obtain a users permission to track their data across apps or websites owned by other companies for use in advertising or shared with data brokers.
Apples Privacy Policy ensures that privacy remains a top priority in all that we do.
Our suppliers are also obligated to apply our privacy principles via our contractual terms.
"We respect users ability to know, access, change, transfer, restrict, and delete personal data, and we strive to collect the minimum amount of data necessary to power our products and services."
"Customers control what information is shared, where its shared, and when its backed up."
"We do not provide user information to any third parties without a clear legal basis, and we publish a Transparency Report detailing government requests for customer data and app removal."
"Users can exercise their privacy rights at ourdedicated Data and Privacy page, privacy.apple.com , where they can receive acopy of the personal data that Apple holds on them across all of their interactions with us and request deletion or temporary deactivation of their account if they wish."
Apple is committed to delivering advertising in a way that respects user privacy.
"Apple -delivered ads may appear on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks depending on the jurisdiction."
"The Apple advertising platform does not track users, nor does it buy or share user personal information with other companies."
"To continue raising awareness and educating people on how to protect their personal information, on Data Privacy Day in January 2021 we shared a report that illustrates how companies track user data across websites and apps."

Accessibility is a human right.
Nowhere is that more evident than in our work in accessibility.
Our work to make technology customizable to the diverse needs of all our users has become widely known.
"For example, the 2021 WebAIM survey (from the Institute for Disability Research, Policy, and Practice, Utah State University), which analyzed responses from over 1,500 users around the world who have a vision disability and use a screen reader, shows that 71.9% of survey respondents use iPhone or iPad with Apples VoiceOver as their primary mobile platform."
"Apple has also been repeatedly honored for our accessibility work, including most recently receiving a FCC Chairs Award for Advancement in Accessibility for iOS 14, which added a suite of accessibility features that have particular importance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"These features People Detection, VoiceOver Recognition, sign language prominence in FaceTime, and Sound Recognition have helped users with disabilities navigate day-to-day life during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Our passion and commitment to inclusion led Apple to recently join the Valuable 500 and be designated Iconic Partner for inclusive design.
"The Valuable 500s mission includes tangible action for disability inclusion, starting at the CEO level to grow investments in company culture, standards, recruitment, representation, and research worldwide."

"The People Detection feature in Magnifier uses camera, LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to help support health and safety for users who are blind or have low vision and need to maintain social distancing."
"Hearing To support customers who are deaf or hard of hearing , Apple was the first to directly connect hearing aids or a cochlear implant to iPhone and other iOS devices through the Made for iPhone (MFi) program."
This enables customers to make phone calls and stream high-quality audio directly to their MFi hearing devices.
"And in 2021, Apple added support for the latest generation of bidirectional hearing aids from Made for iPhone partners that support hands- free phone and FaceTime conversations."
"Sound Recognition notifies users of external environmental sounds like running water, alarms, electrical appliances, breaking glass, and more, with the newly introduced option to train your iPhone or iPad to listen for a specific alarm or electrical appliance sound."
"Other features include Live Captions (beta), introduced in 2022, which helps users with hearing disabilities follow along with calls and media on iPhone, iPad, and Mac; sign language prominence in FaceTime, which can detect when someone uses sign language in group calls; and Conversation Boost for AirPods Pro, which helps users better hear conversations in crowded or noisy environments."

"Working with the World Federation of the Deaf, the American Council of the Blind, the Cerebral Palsy Foundation, and the National Association of the Deaf, Apple proposed the adoption of accessibility-themed emoji to the Unicode Consortium, the global body in charge of setting character standards across all computing platforms."
"In 2019, the consortium adopted Apples recommendation for more inclusive and representational emoji."
"And in 2021, we expanded the accessibility options for Memoji to include cochlear implants, an oxygen tube, and a soft helmet."
"Inclusive design Building on our accessibility work, weve always believed that in order to create the most personal technology in the world, we must consider the full range of human experiences."
All across Apple there is a sustained commitment to making products more inclusive for a wide range of diverse groups.
Apple engineers work hand in hand with teams across the business to help solve unique problems others seldom think about.
"For example, with iOS 14.5, Siri no longer has a default voice, allowing users to choose the voice that speaks to them when they first set up their device, and in English, users can now select more diverse voice options."
"Were also taking steps to ensure equity in our cameras automatic person recognition features so that everyone can have the same extraordinary experience, no matter the photographic subjects skin color, age, or gender."
"As a result, the machine learning models used in camera technology must show similar performance across various age groups, genders, ethnicities, skin tones, and other attributes."
Weve also published research on this work to help others learn from it.
"Beyond our own products and services, weve developed machine learning research and Human Interface Guidelines to support developers in building inclusive apps that put people first by prioritizing respectful communication and presenting content and functionality in ways that everyone can access and understand."

Apple is carbon neutral for corporate emissions as of April 2020.

Emissions from R&D processes.
3.
"Beginning in FY2021, were accounting for scope 2 emissions from the purchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam."
4.
"In fiscal year 2017, we started calculating scope 3 emissions not listed in this table."
"In fiscal year 2021, these include electricity transmission and distribution losses amounted to about 28,000 metric tons CO 2e and life cycle emissions associated with renewable energy amounted to about 95,000 metric tons CO 2e."
"We have not accounted for emissions resulting from employees working from home, because we anticipated these emissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving our methodology."
5.
We regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability standards.
"So in fiscal year 2018, we changed how we calculate emissions from business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air travel."
"As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissions increased by 77 percent between 2017 and 2018."
"Without the methodology change, these emissions would have increased by 14 percent, which reflects the growth in our business."
6.
"Beginning in fiscal year 2020, we updated our methodology to reflect the impact of COVID-19 on employee commute."
7.
"We retired 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal year 2021."
This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards.
8.
"Because were committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refine our product life cycle assessment model and sources of data."
"For example, we recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our products are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid emission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase."
The net result was an increase in our 2021 carbon footprint.
"When using the same level of data granularity and model as 2021, our product use carbon emissions in 2021 would have been about 2.5 percent lower."
9.
"For fiscal year 2021, we retired credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya, and purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total of 500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain."
"The first project, a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala, protects and conserves forests from deforestation and degradation."
"The second project aims to establish forests on about 46,000 hectares of barren land that is not otherwise in use across seven counties in the Guizhou Province of China."
"Both projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for projects in the Restore Fund, including VCS and CCBS."
These projects are all certified to the VCS and CCB standards.

"Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated cumulatively since 2012."
All efficiency measures are retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the California Energy Commission.
"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate facilities energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate controls due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy."
These savings are not included in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives.
We also recognize that energy use at our employees homes likely increased during this period.
"We have not accounted for this energy use, because we anticipated this impact is small relative to our overall energy use and we are still evolving our methodology."
3.
Energy savings from supplier energy efficiency improvements are reported as annualized annual numbers.
