Expatriate scientists led the previous surveys with support from PNG students and citizens.
"In 2021, ExxonMobil PNG Limited decided that PMAs would be led by and include only national scientists, with remote support from expatriates."
"The PNG team leads for the 2021 survey had participated in the surveys since 2015, gaining knowledge and helping build the PNG scientific community."
An assessment to verify 2020 annual forest cover changes against 2019 data in the Upstream area after construction activities concluded that the identified broad-scale forest loss or degradation was not attributable [6] to ExxonMobil PNG Limiteds activities.
Many of the detected disturbances came from a local tradition of landowners setting up shelters or gardens closer to project facilities or the pipeline right-of-way to symbolize their ownership.
"ExxonMobil PNG Limiteds awareness programs, community messaging and engagements with local communities help them gain an understanding of biodiversity values and importance of conservation."
"The awareness and training have been provided to communities, community leaders and village liaison officers."
The annual Environmental and Social Report for 2021 discusses the performance of the PNG LNG biodiversity management program in detail.

ExxonMobil Sustainability Report35Managing spills ExxonMobil is committed to the prevention and elimination of spills from our operations.
We seek to implement industry best practices to continually reduce the number of spills.
We design and operate facilities with the objective of preventing unplanned releases from entering the environment and causing adverse effects.
"Our Spill Prevention Program establishes corporate-wide procedures for inspecting and maintaining equipment, training operators and conducting practice drills."
"If a spill does occur , we conduct a rapid, comprehensive response to minimize impact on communities and the environment."
Our spill response research program is an industry- leading in-house program with a focus on cold-water and remote locations that also applies to local or surface spills.
"At ExxonMobil refineries, we recently enhanced the existing human factors approach to reinforce the zero-spill mindset among employees."
Specialists developed a best practice guide that outlines 17 high-risk elements and corresponding procedures designed to reduce the likelihood of a spill caused by human error .
This guide is credited with reducing such spills by more than 36% from 2016 to 2021.
ExxonMobil uses comprehensive integrity-management programs to oversee the transportation of millions of barrels of petroleum and chemical products over thousands of miles of pipeline around the world.
"For example, our pipeline affiliate in the U."
"S. regularly tests its pipelines to detect corrosion and other integrity concerns and uses skilled personnel in ground and air patrols, state-of-the-art systems, alarms and other techniques to continuously control and monitor pipeline routes."
"In addition to prevention, we focus on maintaining a state of readiness to quickly and effectively respond to incidents resulting from our operations."
"To ensure that a response to an incident will be coordinated and effective, each site conducts emergency drills in accordance with regulatory requirements or management guidelines, ranging from desktop exercises to full-scale field drills."
"Annually, we conduct comprehensive multi-day drills at sites around the world, involving emergency response teams and hundreds of employees, contractors and specialists."
Participants run through realistic scenarios and interact with local authorities and agencies.
"ExxonMobil Sustainability Report36 Improving air quality ExxonMobil recognizes the importance of clean air to our communities and implements emission-reduction initiatives, including those that reduce nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds at our operated assets."
"From 2016 to 2021, total reportable emissions of volatile organic compounds, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides decreased by approximately 24% at operated assets."
"As part of our approach to improving air quality, we evaluate the potential impact of our emissions to the communities where we operate."
"Based on these insights, we advance appropriate capital projects and initiatives while working with regulatory agencies to assess and address potential air quality issues."
ExxonMobils approach to air quality management includes: Understanding the composition and extent of our emissions.
Meeting or exceeding environmental regulations.
Reducing air emissions to minimize potential impacts on local communities.
Monitoring the science and health standards related to air quality.
Our corporate-wide initiatives to reduce GHG emissions intensity also have the potential to further improve air quality by lowering non-GHG emissions.
Our approach to improving air qualityExxonMobil Sustainability Report37 Minimizing operational waste Everyone at ExxonMobil plays a role in reducing operational waste.
"Our waste mitigation hierarchy prioritizes waste avoidance when feasible and when waste is unavoidable, we work to reduce, recover or reuse it whenever possible."
We aim to dispose of waste only if other options have been exhausted and we have robust processes to select waste sites that meet our high standards and expectations.
Our global network of lubricants blending and packaging plants have a Zero Waste to Landfill Silver validation[8] from Underwriters Laboratories (UL).
We were the first petroleum products company to receive this status by diverting over 90% of waste produced in our global plant network from local landfills.
"Our objective is to continuously look for ways to minimize waste through practices like process changes; raw material changes; material handling, storage, transportation; as well as treatment and/or disposal of any remaining waste in compliance with applicable regulations."
"To do that, we utilize a waste mitigation hierarchy that starts with waste avoidance."
"Underwriters LaboratoriesWaste mitigation hierarchy ExxonMobil Sustainability Report38 Decommissioning and rehabilitation Decommissioning is the process of dismantling, removing and/or reusing facilities."
"ExxonMobils approach to decommissioning assets varies by location, type of asset and environmental characteristics of the site."
"We incorporate applicable regulatory requirements and globally accepted practices and take into account views expressed by relevant stakeholders, including fishing communities, environmental organizations, recycling experts and academia."
Decommissioning an offshore asset presents complex challenges.
"In addition to the inherent risks of removal, our plans must consider each assets specific marine ecosystems and facility characteristics, including complexity, size and weight."
"Planning and preparation for decommissioning assets can start up to 10 years before execution, and ExxonMobil has a dedicated offshore decommissioning Center of Expertise for this purpose."
"Instead of decommissioning an asset, the company may choose to rehabilitate it."
Rehabilitation is the process of safely repurposing properties that no longer support our operations.
We consider the interests of various stakeholders when selecting site-specific approaches to repurpose properties.
Our goal is to prevent legacy impacts on the environment while creating opportunities for beneficial reuse.
ExxonMobil Environmental and Property Solutions (E&PS) is our global organization that supports the remediation and stewardship of surplus onshore sites.

We consult with local groups and individuals regularly and we seek to have our stakeholders effectively represented as community concerns are discussed and decisions are made.
"Our engagement process is tailored to local communities to help provide effective, accessible and culturally appropriate channels for exchanging information and proactively identifying issues or concerns."
"Examples of activities in our engagement process include open houses, community gatherings and individual meetings."
"By integrating the results of these discussions into our decisions, we can help avoid or reduce potential impacts on communities, enhance benefits, support effective investments, avoid delays and resolve issues at the local level."
Our ongoing community engagement includes a grievance-management process that provides a diverse set of platforms for individuals or communities to raise concerns.
"They include direct, in-person and electronic engagement and the use of third-party proxies such as civil society organizations and nongovernmental associations."
"We dedicate personnel to map, track, analyze, respond to and resolve community grievances in a timely manner in a way that seeks to support confidentiality and non-retaliation."
Our grievance management practices are guided by the World Bank International Finance Corporation and Ipieca.
"For more information on how our process and practices for stakeholder engagement and grievance management support our integrated approach to human rights due diligence, see the section on Human Rights."

We understand the importance of building and maintaining a qualified and competitive supply chain in the countries in which we operate.
Our approach to local supplier development and utilization includes purchasing goods and services from local suppliers and building their capabilities to help create a competitive local industrial base.
"We work with a range of stakeholders, including host country governments, nongovernmental organizations and local communities to support the development of local vendors."
"To become a supplier for ExxonMobil a local vendor must meet our robust safety, technical, environmental and human rights expectations and requirements."
"When possible, we work with businesses owned by local individuals, women and members of historically disadvantaged communities to help them become competitive vendors that contribute to our business and the long-term economic progress of the community."
Investments in local communities We support economic development of local communities with our investments.
"We engage and collaborate with community members, stakeholders and host governments to develop meaningful projects that help build and sustain economic growth while improving social conditions."
"We consider the development goals of each community when deciding where, when and how best to invest."

"Land use, resettlement and livelihood restoration We respect property rights in the countries and communities where we operate."
We aim to minimize involuntary resettlement through a disciplined site selection process.
"Whenever land is necessary for projects, we adhere to applicable host country regulatory requirements governing land acquisition, in addition to our own internal standards."
"If projects are externally financed, we also adhere to lender stipulations regarding land use, access and resettlement requirements."
"To the extent practicable, we seek to avoid involuntary resettlement and minimize the need for voluntary resettlement."
"To minimize the need for resettlement we assess multiple potential locations for our operations based on criteria such as availability, accessibility and safety, as well as environmental and social considerations."
"If physical or economic displacement occurs, we develop and implement location- specific and culturally appropriate resettlement action plans (RAPs)."
We consult with landowners and other potentially impacted individuals or households.
"We survey and map housing structures, gardens, wildlife, sources for nature-based products, harvesting areas and other assets to support the development of RAPs and effective livelihood restoration programs."

"ExxonMobil seeks to understand the perspectives of Indigenous peoples through open consultation and we consider their feedback into project planning, design, execution and operations."
We support local employment initiatives and cultural heritage programs through local content development and strategic community investments.
"Our interactions with Indigenous peoples around the world are consistent with the goals of the following frameworks: International Labor Organization Convention 169 Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples International Finance Corporation Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability World Bank Operational Policy and Bank Procedure on Indigenous Peoples ExxonMobil is committed to conducting meaningful consultations with Indigenous peoples, incorporating traditional knowledge and land use information into our plans, and promoting community engagement programs that respect traditions and cultures."
"Meaningful engagement is a key aspect of Free, Prior and Informed Consent, a specific right that pertains to Indigenous peoples and is recognized in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples."
One of our objectives is to determine how Indigenous peoples prefer to engage.
"Communities may decide whether they want us to meet with elected leaders, community elders or other representatives, and whether those engagements are conducted in a public forum, either formally or informally."
"We enable communities to establish their preference for how often and how long their members meet with ExxonMobil representatives, and who will provide their viewpoints or represent their wishes."
Our approach to working with Indigenous peoples Cultural heritage We look for opportunities to help preserve cultural heritage by managing the potential impacts of our operations and by making culturally appropriate community investments.
"At ExxonMobil, our respect for the cultural heritage and customs of local communities carries into our business practices from project design and execution through ongoing operations."
"As we design our projects, we consider cultural and spiritual considerations, heritage sites, biodiversity conservation, traditional knowledge and efficient use of resources."
We value and honor the diverse cultural histories of the areas where we operate.
"To do that, we use a cultural heritage identification process to identify potential sites of cultural significance."
"If the recovery or relocation of an artifact is appropriate, ExxonMobil develops tailored procedures in consultation with technical experts, local communities and host country government officials."
We leverage relevant studies to deepen the knowledge among our workforce and provide training to our construction and field contractor personnel to identify different types of cultural heritage in the areas where we work.

"Since 2000, ExxonMobil has provided more than $170 million in funding for antimalarial programs that have reached more than 185 million people."
"Our support has resulted in the distribution of more than 15.1 million bed nets, 5.6 million doses of antimalarial treatments and 4 million rapid diagnostic kits, as well as training for nearly 900,000 health workers."
"Thanks to the work of the many collaborations with governments, businesses and civil society, malarial deaths have been reduced by more than half since 2000 and infection rates have drastically declined."
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1.5 billion cases of malaria have been prevented since 2000[12].
"In October 2021, the WHO authorized use of a malaria vaccine for children, a potential breakthrough in the fight against malaria."
ExxonMobil was one of several organizations that helped support the development of this first-ever malaria vaccine.

"Increasing women-owned businesses stimulates innovation, enhances competition in the supply chain and builds customer and supplier loyalty by supporting the communities in which we operate."
"We focus investments on developing women entrepreneurs, implementing programs on financial literacy, and providing access to savings accounts and improving productivity of women farmers."
ExxonMobil and the ExxonMobil Foundation have supported women in more than 90 countries seeking to fulfill their economic potential and drive economic and social change in their communities.
"From 2005 through 2021, we have invested more than $127 million to help community-based and global partners implement programs that directly benefit women."
"ExxonMobil Sustainability Report58For instance, our funding has allowed 5,000 female entrepreneurs to benefit from the nonprofit Solar Sisters business training while bringing life-altering energy solutions to their local communities."
"This effort has reached more than 1.7 million people and created a positive ripple effect on health, education and the environment."
"Meanwhile, more than 2,800 women entrepreneurs have strengthened their skills and grown their businesses by participating in the Road to Growth program, a collaboration between the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women and ExxonMobil Foundation."
"Three-quarters of the participants in Nigeria increased their savings and more than half increased their business revenues, even during the pandemic."
"For the past several years, ExxonMobil has invested approximately $500 million annually in women-owned businesses."
"ExxonMobil is also a founding member of the Global Business Coalition for Womens Economic Empowerment [13], a private-sector consortium that fosters economic change for women."
"Solar Sister Road to Growth EmpowerWomen ExxonMobil has supported the National Math and Science Initiative since its founding in 2007, a program that has touched the lives of more than 2 million students."

Plans and initiatives are reviewed to identify opportunities related to inclusive sourcing and environmental performance as well as to identify potential human rights impacts within category families.
Objectives are established annually.
ExxonMobil utilizes a source-to-contract platform that facilitates consideration of sustainability in the acquisition process.
Steps have been included to assist in identifying diverse suppliers and incorporate sustainability elements into commercial activities.
"Not only do we review a potential suppliers operational, technical and financial performance, we also perform compliance due diligence."
"We screen potential suppliers across compliance areas such as sanctions, anti-corruption and human trafficking using third-party information."
"Our approach to managing our supply chain Supplier diversity and inclusive sourcing We promote inclusive sourcing by championing local, small and diverse suppliers in order to increase competition and innovation while striving to make positive impacts on communities."
"Where there is a lack of diverse, small or local suppliers, ExxonMobil aims to contribute to building capacity within our supply chain."
We are committed to economic empowerment and aim to increase the number of women-owned and historically disadvantaged-owned businesses in our global supply chain.
ExxonMobil Sustainability Report62 Celebrating 50 years of supplier diversity ExxonMobil celebrated the 50th anniversary of our focus on supplier diversity in 2021.
"Working with diverse suppliers creates new perspectives, ideas and practices that benefit communities and ExxonMobil."
ExxonMobil invites U.
S. businesses owned by traditionally underrepresented groups to express interest in becoming an ExxonMobil supplier through our U.
S. supplier diversity database.
"ExxonMobil works with organizations such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council, the Womens Business Enterprise National Council, the National Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Chamber of Commerce and the National Veteran-Owned Business Association to help identify and develop relationships with certified diverse suppliers in the U."
S. ExxonMobil aims to increase the number of women-owned businesses in our global supply chain.
"We work with WEConnect International, an organization that identifies, educates, registers and certifies businesses outside the U."
"S. that are at least 51% owned, managed and controlled by one or more women."
Our supplier diversity efforts continue to grow.
"To mark the 50th anniversary, ExxonMobil launched initiatives designed to expand the use of diverse suppliers including creating an Inclusive Sourcing Advisory Council with senior business line leaders to identify opportunities and increase engagement with diverse suppliers, creating the EM Mentor , Advocate, Teach program to help those suppliers build capacity and gain exposure."

We leverage current processes and systems to assess our direct suppliers for potential human rights risks in the supply chain.
"These risks focus on workers rights, including safe and healthy working conditions, as well as the elimination of forced labor , child labor and discrimination."
Our approach to managing our supply chain Environmental performance in our supply chain We seek and aspire to work with innovative suppliers to minimize environmental impacts in our supply chain.
We incorporate environmental considerations when developing cost models and sourcing strategies.
Examples include reducing energy use and incorporating recycled content into packaging materials.
We also assess and engage with suppliers through relationship management.
Environmental performance is an important consideration in our commercial decisions.
"Since 2021, sustainability questions have been embedded in our sourcing platform and considered in bid evaluation and supplier selection."
"Supply chain human rights Our Statement on Labor and the Workplace articulates our support of the principles of the International Labor Organization (ILO) 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles on Rights at Work, including elimination of child labor , forced labor and workplace discrimination, the recognition of the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and a safe and healthy workplace."
"Through our regimented procurement process, we seek to do business with suppliers who observe similar standards."
Purchases arranged by our global procurement organization include contract language that requires adherence to all applicable laws and regulations.
"Furthermore, requests for quotations issued by our procurement staff typically include clauses relating to the prohibition of forced or child labor and the payment of wages in accordance with local laws."
Participants are required to adhere to those requirements.
Auditing is another important component of supply-chain transparency.
Our contracts typically require suppliers and all their subcontractors to allow ExxonMobil to access all offices and work locations and to interview supplier and subcontractor personnel.
"We select a certain percentage of suppliers annually for such audits, which include a compliance review on contract provisions."
Human trafficking issues have received considerable attention in recent years.
"ExxonMobil proactively manages supply chain risks, including those associated with human trafficking, through our Standards of Business Conduct, our Statement on Labor and the Workplace and our due diligence processes."
We also seek to reduce the underlying conditions that lead to human trafficking by working to engender economic growth and personal prosperity.

"Our success, today and in the future, is based on the talent, ingenuity and hard work of our people, fueled by pride in what we do and what we stand for ."
Our ability to attract the worlds best talent is important to our success.
Developing people and maintaining a strong culture are core strategic priorities essential to achieving our long-term objectives.
"Our focus areas Leading in personnel safety Enhancing process safety Excerpt: Investing in People ExxonMobil Sustainability Report67 Leading in personnel safety At ExxonMobil, our people are our most valuable resource."
We have a long history of embedding safety into our culture.
"The culture is reinforced by safety leadership, standards, practices and experience."
"We focus on an integrated framework of systems, processes, tools and behaviors aimed at eliminating injuries and fatalities."
We aspire to an environment where Nobody Gets Hurt and our Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) demonstrates results from our top tier safety programs [17].
"In 2021, we maintained best-ever results with a LTIR of 0.02 per 200,000 work hours [18]."
We plan to build on this industry-leading position.
"ExxonMobil is committed to protecting the safety, security and health of our employees, our contractors and others involved with our operations, as well as our customers and the public."
"These commitments are documented in the Safety, Health, Environment and Product Safety policies found in our Standards of Business Conduct."
"Our work in this area is put into practice through OIMS, which guides the daily activities of our global workforce by setting clear expectations for managing the risks inherent to our business."
The OIMS framework goes beyond our employees to include third-party providers and contractors.
We include specific safety and health expectations in contractual agreements with these third parties.
"We focus on delivering consistent, sustainable results through OIMS and leaders engage with their teams to drive effective application."
Each business unit has leadership management systems and work processes aimed to consistently meet operations objectives.

This approach supports the health of workers and surrounding communities where we operate.
Our health management systems have recently been enhanced to focus on high-priority health issues and safeguards.
These elements enable ExxonMobil to address total workforce health more effectively.
"When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, our emergency preparedness and response procedures were swiftly triggered at the country, regional and facility levels, building on lessons learned from SARS, Pandemic Flu, MERS and Ebola."
"Our preventive and mitigation safeguards, combined with coordinated internal communications, helped protect the health and safety of our workers and their dependents."
"Our measures were continually refined as more information about the virus was identified, in consultation with internal and external health experts."
"When vaccines became available, they were globally promoted for early access by our employees through administration sites in the community and our workplaces, in close collaboration with local health authorities."
"Extensive information on the vaccines, COVID-19 and safeguard adaptation were periodically communicated to workers through multiple channels, including webinars with world-renowned experts."
"Concurrently, we globally deployed resilience programs and made mental health initiatives available to employees and dependents, effectively supporting them in minimizing the substantial impact of the pandemic on their personal and professional lives."
"Building safety into a new operation In 2021, we announced the collaborative startup of Gulf Coast Growth Ventures (GCGV) petrochemical manufacturing facility in San Patricio County, Texas, a joint venture with Sabic."
"This plant, which began operations in early 2022, can produce packaging materials, agricultural film, construction materials, clothing and automotive coolants, helping to meet the growing demand for performance products."
"Safety was embedded in the development and operation of this facility to help protect our people, minimize risks across the operations and promote excellence in performance."
"Before employees could work at GCGV, they had to undergo 1824 months of training at ExxonMobil facilities to learn responsible operating procedures."
These actions enabled us to build and open the plant safely ahead of schedule and under budget.
ExxonMobil Sustainability Report69 Enhancing process safety Safety is a core value and an integral part of our culture.
Process Safety focuses on managing the hazards that can be created from the vast equipment and complex processes that are essential to our business.
"The primary purpose is to keep hydrocarbons, chemicals and process water controlled and safely managed at all times through all phases of our operations."
"Process safety events can potentially impact the workforce, the community and the environment."
"Because of this, we set high expectations for ourselves."
Everyone involved in our operations plays a role in driving process safety excellence.
We are now in the fourth year of a corporate-wide Process Safety initiative.
"From 2016 through 2021, we achieved a 31% reduction in Tier 1 process safety events (those of greatest consequence) with further improvement steps underway."
"To help protect our employees, contractors, communities where we work and the environment, ExxonMobil uses a proactive, disciplined approach to managing risks inherent to our operations."
"Our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) serves as the foundation for managing process safety risks, establishing clear expectations."
"The safeguards built into OIMS are integral to how we design, operate and maintain our facilities."
"We work to verify and rigorously manage these safeguards through maintenance, inspection, operations testing, competency demonstrations and emergency preparedness drills."
"As part of OIMS, ExxonMobil monitors the performance of joint ventures and assets operated by others consistent with our expectations and encourages them to consider improvements as appropriate."
"As part of ExxonMobils approach to enterprise risk management, higher-consequence process safety risks and risk management strategies are stewarded by the companys Management Committee."
"Our Upstream, Product Solutions and Low Carbon Solutions companies develop and execute these strategies with centralized support from ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company and from the ExxonMobil Global Operations & Sustainability organizations Process Safety and Reliability and Maintenance Center of Excellence."
"Our primary objective is to help protect our people, communities and the environment by successfully managing and enhancing process safety."
"Our approach to enhancing process safetyExxonMobil Sustainability Report70Workplace security ExxonMobils robust security measures are designed to protect our personnel, including senior executives, and facilities from threats."
"Our security programs comply with regulations, are risk-based, flexible and responsive to the environments in which we operate."
Facilities undergo periodic security analyses to address potential threats.
"Each assessment considers geographic location, relationships with the community, criminal activity and the current political climate."
"We monitor local conditions and maintain detailed security preparedness plans, such as evacuation and intruder response plans."
We train employees who travel to and live in higher-risk countries on personal safety in challenging security environments.
"Our security personnel work to improve our risk management methodologies, threat-assessment capabilities and technical security management processes through drills, training programs and industry forums."
Cybersecurity business continuity and management Protecting our people and assets includes managing the risks posed by cyber-attacks.
"As cybersecurity risks continue to evolve, we must protect our business against cyber-related business disruptions and threats that can potentially affect our data, facilities, operations and the safety and privacy of our people."
Awareness remains one of our best defenses and cybersecurity education is a priority for ExxonMobil.
All of our personnel must complete annual web-based cybersecurity training to help them understand and respond to potential cybersecurity risks and to reinforce safe behaviors.
"In addition to promoting safe behaviors, we have developed business continuity plans with a suite of enablers that will be activated in the event of a major cyber-attack."
"Our business continuity plans are reviewed for compliance, performance and improvements via annual updates and periodic drills."
"Emergency preparedness ExxonMobil is prepared to respond to a wide array of emergency events, including natural disasters, pandemics and operational incidents."
Each ExxonMobil facility has access to trained responders and resources.
"Centralized and cross-functional teams develop and practice emergency response tactics through incident management teams and emergency support groups around the world, which enables us to provide a robust response in emergency situations to help protect people, the environment and our communities."
"In 2021, our Regional Response Team (RRT) demonstrated its Readiness to Respond capabilities under pandemic circumstances by conducting an innovative exercise that simulated a global response to a potential real-life oil spill event."
"Approximately 300 RRT personnel and response partners from more than 35 countries were involved in a continuous 28-hour follow-the-sun event, with face-to-face hubs in Singapore, the U."
"K., Prague and Houston, along with virtual support globally."
Exercises like this help support our objective to be prepared and ready to respond.
