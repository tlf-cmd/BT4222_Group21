"We continuously scan the ecosystem to identify and invest in new capabilities, work with clients to help secure the environment and take action to improve the security, integrity and resiliency of our network."
We invest in innovation to build and maintain trust for our network and the broader payments ecosystem.
"Specifically, we have invested approximately $9 billion in cybersecurity over the past five years, with about $500 million of that specifically allocated to data and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities."
"We continue to evolve our security capabilities and work to lower our global fraud rate, which is at an all-time low of $0.07 for every $100 in payment volume on our network."
"The Visa Intelligent Security framework offers our ecosystem partners dynamic, data-rich solutions that help balance fraud reduction and dispute prevention."
Our aim is to increase approvals so that businesses can thrive while customers are protected and satisfied no matter where or how they are paid or pay.
The Intelligent Security framework spans the entire transaction lifecycle: Onboarding & Management Provide financial institutions with tools to identify identity fraud at account opening.
"Through our financial institution clients, we provide tools to manage security, including account use restrictions and customizable alerts."
Consumer Identity & Authentication Apply artificial intelligence-powered authentication strategies to prevent unauthorized acc ess to Visa accounts.
"Transaction Authorization Use tools such as Visa Advanced Authorization, which applies r eal-time AI and machine learning to evaluate the trustworthiness of transactions to prevent fraud without inconveniencing consumers."
"Dispute Management Help consumers and issuers proactively address transaction disputes with Visa tools such as Verifi, which provides issuers and customers access to transaction information from sellers via a global data-sharing network."
Performance Optimization Enhance payment performance by reducing fraud and increasing efficiency.
We continue to work with clients across different regions to meet their unique needs and accelerate the adoption of these solutions.
We measure the effectiveness of our approach to payments security on an ongoing basis.
"We monitor metrics such as fraud rates for Card Present and Card Not Present scenarios as well as transaction volumes that leverage secure technologies, such as 3-D Secure or Tokenization."
"Additionally, we implement capability roadmaps for digitalization and automation."
"We improve the operational resilience of our network by engaging with ecosystem participants to gather perspectives, benchmark our thinking and approach and steer our security investments."

"2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 17 AI-Powered Innovations for Smarter Payments Visa is leveraging AI to improve our customer experience and enhance processes that enable the movement of billions of dollars across thousands of institutions in more than 200 countries and territories and 160 currencies."
"In February 2021, Visa announced VisaNet +AI, a suite of AI-powered services that enhance predictability, transparency and speed in the payment experience."
"VisaNet +AI includes Visa Smarter Posting and Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast, as well as Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (STIP)."
"Smarter Posting When a restaurant-goer adds a tip, or when a cross-border payment involves multiple currencies, the amount authorized in real time at checkout can differ from the amount eventually cleared from a consumers account."
Banks often delay posting the payment or updating the account balance until they have certainty about the final amount.
"To help issuers create a better banking experience for cardholders, Visa developed Smarter Posting, a service that uses AI to deliver a customized score for each transaction as part of the authorization process."
The Smarter Posting model analyzes transaction details and historical data to predict the likelihood that a transaction amount will remain consistent through clearing.
"Smarter Settlement Forecast As the final step in the payment cycle, transactions are aggregated, transfers are facilitated between acquirers and issuers, and merchant accounts are credited for completed sales."
Visa created Smarter Settlement Forecast to provide financial institution clients with customized 7-day forecasts of the settlement amount they may need on hand each day.
"The service uses information generated by historical settlement volumes, seasonal indicators, macro-trends, outlier events and real-time transaction data to provide high-quality predictions of cash outflows and inflows."
Smarter Stand-In Processing Smarter STIP uses deep learning to help financial institutions increase transaction authorizations during outages.
Smarter STIP generates an informed decision to approve or decline transactions on behalf of issuers to provide consumers with a frictionless Visa payment experience.

"In addition, we are subject to privacy and data security laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)."
"Data Privacy At Visa, building trust begins with a commitment to privacy and security, which instills confidence in our employees and clients, protects our brand and allows us to innovate responsibly."

These values inform Visas role as a leader in the payments ecosystem.
Data innovation is a vital component of Visas strategy and in everything we do built on our 60-year legacy of responsible data stewardship.

"Suppliers Visa recognizes the importance of addressing the emissions from our purchased goods and services, which make up 94 percent of Visas scope 3 emissions."
"To that end, Visa engages with our suppliers to help them measure and report their emissions and to set Science Based Targets."
"Our efforts to engage suppliers include incorporating environmental sustainability expectations in the Visa Supplier Code of Conduct, which suppliers r eceive during the onboarding process, and Visas participation in the Carbon Disclosur e Project (CDP) Supply Chain program."
"Through the CDP Supply Chain program, we engage our leading suppliers around measuring their emissions footprint, setting targets, reporting to the CDP and attributing their footprint back to Visa."
"Since joining the CDP Supply Chain program, Visa has expanded outreach to suppliers who represent appro ximately two-thirds of Visas emissions as calculated by spend."
"Our Results To measure and manage our environmental impact, Visa has conducted a global environmental footprint assessment with support from leading third-party firms each year since 2008."
"We measure our global energy and water use, waste production, landfill diversion and GHG emissions."
Our energy and GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.
The 2021 GHG Verification Statement is publicly av ailable on our website and included in the Appendix of this report.
"2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 38 Energy & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Around the world, momentum continues to accelerate behind the need to take urgent action on climate change and transition to a low-carbon economy."
"Visa is responding by taking serious action to reduce GHG emissions, including achieving carbon neutrality across our operations for the first time in 2020."
"This achievement, which includes the footprint from our scope 1, scope 2 and the employee commuting/business travel components o f scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, is the result of ongoing energy efficiency initiatives, our transition to 100 percent renewable electricity and limited use of carbon offsets to cover our residual footprint."
Our carbon offsets portfolio spans regions in which we operate and includes projects such as forest management in the U.
"S., reforestation in Uruguay, renewable energy generation in Turkey, China and India and clean cookstove initiatives in Kenya and Uganda."
"We use international standards, including the GHG Protocol, to measure and report GHG emissions associated primarily with our energy usage, business travel and employee commuting."

"2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 42 Alignment with Task Force on Climate- Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Governance Throughout 2021, Visa focused on increasing Board engagement and education on climate-related issues through quarterly ESG updates to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which meets at least quarterly and has formal responsibility for and oversight of corporate responsibility and sustainability policies, programs and reporting, including those related to climate change."
"These updates cover internal climate-related goals, initiatives and external developments, including on climate-related goals, initiatives and risk."
Our Chief Sustainability Officer communicates directly with the Board and continues to help formalize oversight and governance of climate-related topics within Visa.
"Strategy Visas global sustainability strategy centers on our goals of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 and maintaining carbon neutral operations, while limiting use of offsets."
We harness our global brand and initiatives to drive decarbonization efforts and promote sustainable practices beyond our direct operations.
"An example of these actions was the launch of Visa Eco Benefits, a new package of sustainability-focused benefits for account issuers designed to enable and encourage cardholders to engage in sustainable consumption behaviors."
This new account benefits bundle expands Visas sustainability solutions for clients as part of our climate positive goal.
We continue to monitor and assess climate-related risks and opportunities and embed these considerations into our business strategy decisions.
See our inaugural Green Bond report for information on the financing of our climate-related objectives.
"Risk Management Visa maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework to identify, assess, treat, monitor and report on substantive risks."
"Prior to FY21, we conducted a deep dive into our climate-related risks and opportunities in alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)."
This exercise analyzed both direct and indirect climate-related risks and opportunities across our entire business for Business as Usual and 2-Degree climate scenarios.
We aim to update the TCFD assessment on a periodic basis and leverage the findings into our existing ERM process to inform our business planning.
"As an outcome of this analysis, Visa has taken notable steps to reduce upstream risks in our supply chain."
Beginning in 2018 we began collaborating with CDP to collect supplier-specific data.
"Additionally, through our supplier engagement program, we anticipate that we will continue to utilize the CDP Supply Chain survey to collect direct data from our suppliers, enhance ESG language in our Supplier Code of Conduct, develop supplier scorecards, create educational materials on climate topics for internal and external stakeholders and develop individualized engagement approaches on climate topics for our top suppliers."
"Metrics & Targets In 2021, we formally submitted near-term GHG reduction targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)."
"The targets covering scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions and in line with a 1.5C pathway were approved by SBTi in May 2022."
"In addition, Visa has set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement goal."
This goal covers both direct operations and our supply chain.
"We have further developed our approach to 100% renewable electricity to focus on renewable electricity procurement options at our largest facilities and data centers, such as utility and renewable programs, and to rely less on unbundled renewable energy certificates."
This demonstrates that Visa is evolving our approach to renewable electricity procurement to help ensure that our purchases support renewable electricity generation in the areas where we operate.
The largest area of impact in our value chain lies with our suppliers.
"We are expanding on associated metrics, including improved measurement and management of emissions and emissions targets globally."
"As part of our goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2040, in 2021 Visa became a new signatory of The Climate Pledge, an initiative co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism, as well as a new member of the Climate Business Network, a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) initiative to accelerate action toward a net-zero future."
