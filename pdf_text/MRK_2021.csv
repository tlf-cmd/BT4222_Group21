Capital expenditure suppliers provide goods and services such as engineering and construction.
"Our indirect suppliers include those that provide services such as logistics, travel and meetings, facility management and marketing."
Our research providers include lab supplies and other research and development-related services.
"Our approach to sustainable sourcing We have a sourcing management process in which environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and economic inclusion and supplier diversity (EI&SD) principles are integrated in each stage."
"Throughout the supplier life cycle, our Company establishes expectations, assesses risk, supports supplier development and manages performance."
"Our Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) is responsible for driving our Sustainable Sourcing program and maintaining the associated standards and processes by which suppliers are identified, qualified and managed."
"Our Sustainable Sourcing program has the following key elements: Integration into our Global Sourcing & Procurement Strategy andprocesses A cross-functional team that oversees program development and the processes and guidelines to encourage best practices, prevent violations of supply chain standards and limit risk Established sustainability requirements that are communicated toour suppliers and included in supplier selection Review, tracking and communication of supplier sustainabilityprograms Collaboration as we educate and learn from our supply chain, peercompanies and best-in-class organizations Third-Party Risk Management team To help manage and address potential areas of risk associated with third party business relationships, we have an established Third-Party Risk Management program and committee chaired by the senior vice president for Global Procurement."

Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 30 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Our Business Partner Code of Conduct references the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management (the Principles).
"PSCI is a group of more than 50 pharmaceutical and health care companies which promotes sustainable sourcing and better business conditions across the industry, and the Principles set the standard for human rights, ethics, labor, health and safety, environment and related management systems."
"In 2020, the Principles were updated to include a specific reference to human rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, an enhanced ethics section and new clauses on resource efficiency and sustainable sourcing."
"Supplier certification and material review In 2021, GSMG continued a program to certify our suppliers social and environmental sustainability program capabilities."
"We request select suppliers provide sustainability certifications and assurance, which are evaluated to determine if the supplier can be certified as a member of our GREEN Supplier Program."
"Travel and Meetings (including Fleet), Integrated Logistics and Paper-based Packaging Categories are currently included in this program, which: Encourages supplier engagement Shares best practices and improves sustainability practices Tracks supplier sustainability goals Generates a list of GREEN Suppliers and proposed sustainabilityprojects Monitors progress utilizing a key performance indicator (KPI) onthe GSMG Scorecard Additionally, we initiated and participated in a collaborative research project with PSCI to identify risks associated with our suppliers, including prioritizing materials that are considered sensitive."
PSCI has identified materials commonly used within our industry that warrant further examination.
These materials include: Rubber Corn Palm oil Aluminum Shellac Glass Sugar Talc Fish oil Castor seed/oil Soy Cellulose Ethanol Carnauba wax We are incorporating findings from the PSCI joint project into our internal risk assessment and mitigation approaches.
"In addition, we have developed a method for evaluating certifications and materials of concern."
We have also been mapping our supply chain to identify which of our suppliers operate in countries that are known to present significant risks.
We use this information to help us decide the appropriate level of due diligence.
"We recognize that potential risks associated with these materials may also exist beyond our Tier 2 suppliers, and we plan to participate in efforts (in collaboration with PSCI) to ensure that the materials we use are sourced responsibly."
"In 2022, we also surveyed select packaging suppliers and found that most of the suppliers were able to offer certified materials."
Supplier due diligence assessments We have a defined risk-management process and our supply base is measured against the process criteria.
"Using a risk-based approach, supplier assessments and audits are conducted based on multiple factors (e.g., risk profile, engagement and activity type, geography)."
"The assessments and audits evaluate a suppliers ability to meet both industry and our own standards for quality, safety and ethical business practices."
Results are reviewed with senior management across theCompany.
"CONTINUED: GRI 102-9 Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 31 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Our due diligence includes: Anti-bribery and corruption Conflict minerals Denied-party screening Ethics and compliance Financial solvency Information security and cybersecurity Intellectual property Labor and human rights Privacy (data protection) Supply-chain security Where assessments and audits identify deficiencies or opportunities for improvement, we monitor suppliers to ensure that our concerns are addressed in a responsible and compliant manner."
"As part of our oversight and monitoring, we have established mechanisms to report, track and monitor supplier plans to address nonconformance and help drive continued improvement."
Additional review(s) are performed for external manufacturing suppliers and suppliers that manage personal and private information.
"External manufacturers of our products Prospective external manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products are screened for environmental, health and safety (EHS) compliance in addition to quality, supply and technical competence requirements."
"The EHS screening includes a survey covering such topics as regulatory compliance, fatalities and major incidents."
"Based on the screening results and activities undertaken by the supplier, certain external manufacturers are subject to a more detailed on-site assessment conducted by a multidisciplinary team, which may include our Quality, Global Safety and the Environment, Global Technical Operations and GSMG representatives."
The external manufacturers we contract with are periodically reassessed using a risk-based approach; higher-risk external manufacturers are subject to more frequent on-site assessments.
"We expect that observations made during the audit process will be remediated by our external manufacturers, and we monitor and track corrective actions through completion."
"Protecting the privacy of personal information Some of our suppliers, such as contract research organizations, market research agencies, information technology systems developers, corporate card suppliers, and travel and meeting agencies process personal information in connection with their performance of services for our Company."
"We require these suppliers to provide appropriate privacy protection for personal information that they handle in accordance with our privacy policies and applicable privacy laws, regulations and guidelines."
Protecting against cyberattacks and assuring business continuity We recognize that cybersecurity events at suppliers pose an increased risk to our business continuity.
"In 2021, we continued our supplier cyber resiliency risk management program to conduct assessments and review risks and remediation actions with key suppliers."
We also expanded the program by rolling out cybersecurity contract language with selected key suppliers.
The program fosters mutually beneficial working relationships with our suppliers.
We continue to enhance the program to improve operational excellence and continuous monitoring capabilities.
Collaboration is key We are an active member of PSCI.
"The member companies share a vision of better social, health, safety and environmental outcomes in the communities where we buy."
"Collectively, PSCI members share knowledge and expertise across our industry to drive complex, global change more effectively with our suppliers than any one organization alone."
"In 2021, our Company held a one-year position on the PSCI board."
"We also continue to co-lead the Environment Team, and be active members on the Capability Committee and the Human Rights and Labor team."

"4 Undertaken as part of initial supplier due diligence, managed and overseen by GSMG; Scope includes labor and human rights, environment and safety, and ethical business practices."
Decrease in number of assessments was due to the change in criteria in late 2020 for when a Supplier Self-Assessment is required using a risk-based approach.
"5 Announced on-site audits, independently performed by third-party audit firms; primary focus on direct material (Tier 1) supplier facilities located in China, India, Mexico and Indonesia."
Decrease in number of LHR audits was due to the ongoing COVID-19 related restrictions and challenges for conducting on-site audits.
A virtual LHR audit program is being adopted.
6 Monitoring closure of past audit observations revealed by supplier LHR audits; not all Corrective Action Plan Assessments (CAPAs) are due within the same year.
"Remediation of LHR audits observations are in progress; some of these LHR audits were conducted in Dec 2021, hence the lower percentage for remediation."

"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 52 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices CONTINUED: GRI 201-1 GRI 201-2Financial implications and other risks and opportunities due to climate change Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects."
"We believe that climate change has the potential to negatively affect our business and results of operations, cash flows and prospects."
"We are exposed to physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels), risks in transitioning to a low-carbon economy (such as additional legal or regulatory requirements, changes in technology, market risk and reputational risk) and social and human effects (such as population dislocations and harm to health and wellbeing) associated with climate change."
These risks can be either acute (short- term) or chronic (long-term).
"The adverse impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity of natural disasters and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires (exacerbated by drought), flooding and extreme heat."
Extreme weather and sea-level rise pose physical risks to our facilities as well as those of our suppliers.
"Such risks include losses incurred as a result of physical damage to facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by such natural disasters and extreme weather events."
"Other potential physical impacts due to climate change include reduced access to high-quality water in certain regions and the loss of biodiversity, which could impact future product development."
"These risks could disrupt our operations and our supply chain, which may result in increased costs."
"New legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate or adapt to the implications of a changing climate and its effects on the environment."
"These regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, could result in our Company being subject to new or expanded carbon pricing or taxes, increased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, investment in new technologies, increased carbon disclosure and transparency, upgrade of facilities to meet new building codes, and the redesign of utility systems which could increase our operating costs, including the cost of electricity and energy we use."
Our supply chain would likely be subject to these same transitional risks and would likely look to pass along any increased costs to our Company.

"Our compensation programs include competitive base pay, short-term and long-term incentives, and recognition awards."
These programs target different aspects of individual and Company performance.
They are monitored to ensure that they are competitive with those of other companies and appropriate for the markets in which we compete for talent.
"Our health, insurance, retirement and wellbeing programs draw from best practices to ensure quality, competitive value, financial protection, and access to resources to help employees and their families live their lives wellno matter what that looks like for them."
"Benefits vary based on region and country, employee group and status, collective bargaining agreements and local legal requirements."
"For more information on these benefits, please see GRI 401-2 on page 127."
"While we understand the potential risks to our Company, there is limited data around the potential financial implications of these risks."
"Therefore, in 2021, we began performing a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) gap analysis and will be conducting a scenario-planning analysis to examine which parts of our business are at highest risk due to climate change, and the costs associated with them."
"These potential risks are integrated into our business planning, including investment in reducing energy usage, water use and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)."
"We have made it a priority to reduce our demand for energy, and have established internal policies and practices focused on reducing energy use at our sites and minimizing GHG generation throughout the Company."
"By taking these steps, we are not only minimizing GHG emissions but also reducing operating costs and mitigating the business impacts expected to be associated with future climate changerequirements."
"Our Sustainability Capital Fund is used exclusively for sustainability projects at our sites around the world that bring long-term value to the Company and focus on carbon footprint, water use and solid waste reduction."
"The fund allocates up to $12 million per year, which allows us to adopt low carbon technology, better positions us to respond to climate change and supports a more circular1 economy."
"Since 2015, our sites have completed more than 124 projects through the Sustainability Capital Fund, which has avoided the production of an estimated 50,000 metric tons of carbon emissions per year."
"In December 2021, we completed our inaugural issuance of a $1 billion sustainability bond, which was part of an $8 billion underwritten bond offering."
Our Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sustainability bond offering to support projects and partnerships in our priority ESG areas and contribute to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
"Management does not believe that expenditures related to our environmental sustainability initiatives should have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year."
"For more information, please see GRI 305 on page 104."
"Our CDP Climate Change Questionnaire is available on CDP's website, which CDP has aligned to the TCFD reporting recommendations."
"1 As defined by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a circular economy is based on the principles of designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems."

We are committed to addressing unmet medical needs through innovative research and development (R&D).
R&D expenses in 2021 reflected robust clinical development spending as well as increased investment in discovery research and early drug development.
"Our success is largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical R&D, governmental regulation and commercialization."
"We have strategically located discovery centers in regions with active biomedical research communities in California and Massachusetts, as well as principal sites outside of the U."
"S., including the United Kingdom, Switzerland and China."
These centers allow us to recruit talented local scientists and facilitate collaboration with local academic institutions and companies.
These discovery sites complement and connect with our strong R&D capabilities and expertise based at our New Jersey and Pennsylvania sites.
"Global burden of disease As defined by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Visualization tools developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), the diseases that our products address rank high on the list of worldwide causes of illness, disability and death."
"Our research into vaccines and infectious diseases seeks to address major burdens of disease that are prevalent in all countries, and our preventative treatments could have the greatest impact in lower income countries, where health care infrastructure may be limited or nonexistent."
"Considering our pipeline, the list of products we currently market and our external collaborations, we estimate that our Company is seeking to address 71 percent of the top 20 global burdens of disease as defined by the IHME."
"This figure excludes road injuries, age-related hearing loss and neonatal disorders."
This number is lower in 2021 than in 2020 due to spinoff of products to Organon in June 2021.
Compliance Ensuring compliance with applicable laws and requirements in all business areas is critical.
"As such, the stated objective of the Compliance Committee Charter within our research laboratories is to ensure ongoing compliance through appropriate management structure, processes and training."
The Compliance Committee is composed of members of the Research Leadership Team (RLT).
Including the RLT in the Compliance Committee ensures cross-functional awareness and ownership of ethics and compliance at the senior-management level and throughout the whole organization.
"As a result, compliance is focused not only on the conduct of clinical trials but well beyond it, helping to ensure robust oversight of effective policies and procedures, training, auditing and risk management, as well as sponsoring risk identification, prioritization and mitigation for all of Merck Research Laboratories (MRL)."
"The Compliance Committee promotes ethical science and provides guidance to our employees within the research organization on our Companys standards and corporate policies, as well as necessary education related to specific requirements applicable to the researchcommunity."
Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 55 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Clinical research Our Global Clinical Development organization is responsible for conducting clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our products.
"In accordance with our Public Policy Position Statement on Clinical Trial Ethics, all investigational studies in human subjects are conducted in a manner consistent with laws, regulations and guidelines for the protection of human subjects, including those issued by the International Council for Harmonisation: Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP)."
"However, individual country regulations and guidelines remain the primary determinant of specific requirements for the conduct of medical research."
"We are committed to the study of appropriately diverse patient populationsincluding underrepresented groups, women and children, people of varying ages, sexual orientation and gender identities, various socioeconomic backgrounds and other characteristicsin our clinical trials in all appropriate regions of the world."
Currently we conduct our clinical trials in more than 50 countries worldwide.
"In support of this commitment, we have implemented a number of internal and external programs and processes over the past several years."
"Internally, we have a team of clinical trial operations experts focused on promoting the inclusion of patients from diverse backgrounds and on identifying and implementing best practices in the conduct of clinical trials globally."
This begins with selection of clinical trial sites in communities serving underrepresented ethnic groups.
"We provide resources and training to increase awareness of the importance of, and best practices for, inclusion of underrepresented populations in clinical research."
Clinical research studies sponsored by our Company are also being planned and conducted in a way that incorporates enrollment and other diversity-focused goals to help drive inclusion and access across our programs with our clinical trial sites.
"Externally, our Company continues to be a vocal contributor and participant in various partnerships and sponsorships intended to connect with, support and train more U."
S.-based clinicians from diverse backgrounds to help drive access to clinical research at the community level.
We also co-sponsor the Improving Patient Access to Clinical Trials (IMPACT) study at the Lazarex Cancer Foundation.
"IMPACT is a three-year pilot study that strives to improve patient enrollment, retention, minority participation and equitable access in oncology trials."
"We also have developed and implemented novel tools and approaches intended to build relationships and reach potential study participants within their own communities (e.g., partnerships with local pharmacies and mobile study sites)."
"Consistent with ICH-GCP requirements, as part of the informed consent process, clinical trial patients are made aware of the compensation and/or treatment available to them in the event of a trial-related injury."
They are also informed of the person(s) to contact in the event of a trial-related injury.
We maintain policies and procedures that address the costs of treatment of trial subjects in the event of trial-related injuries in accordance with applicable regulatoryrequirement(s).
"Genetic research The rapid development of new technologies that interrogate variability in human DNA and RNA, combined with powerful computing hardware and software, has made it practical to investigate genetic and genomic determinants for risk of human disease or predictors of human response to drugs."
We conduct genetic and genomic research within our own clinical trials and in collaboration with external organizations that have collected human genetic and genomic samples and health data.
"We also conduct genetic and genomic analysis of our clinical trial samples, primarily to understand how genetic and genomic variation impacts patient response to medicines."
"This enables us to communicate information to regulatory authorities and prescribers that will improve the use of our medicines and understand how genetics contribute to the underlying disease, which has the potential to identify new drug targets."
"We obtain subject consent for use of genetic and genomic samples in accordance with ethical principles of human-subjects research, which include respect for persons/autonomy, beneficence and justice, consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki, U."
"S. FDA requirements, ICH E6 Good Clinical Practices guidelines and the 1997 UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights."
"When collaborating with external organizations, we ensure that consent has been obtained by individuals who have contributed DNA or RNA and/or health-related data to the organization via these same standards."

"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 57 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices We do this in several ways, including: Discovering and inventing medicines and vaccines that address vital global health needs where we can have the greatest impact, now and in the future Making available a reliable, safe global supply of quality medicines and vaccines, and investing in solutions to enable timely access to our products in a responsible and sustainable manner Developing, testing and implementing innovative solutions that address barriers to access and affordability of our medicines and vaccines Through partnerships, investment and innovation, applying our expertise and investing our human and financial resources to address systematic barriers to access to health and health equity Our multi-pronged, enterprise-wide approach to access is guided by our Access to Health Guiding Principles, and is responsive to internationally recognized standards and priorities."
"Systematic evaluation to inform product access strategies Embedded within our research and development process, we systematically evaluate our candidates to identify the potential to address significant public health burden and unmet medical needs in underserved health care settings."
"This evaluation process informs our product access strategies, with the goal of making our medicines and vaccines available toas many people as possible through sustainable solutions."
"To facilitate this access, we undertake a systematic evaluation at the onset of Phase 2 clinical studies to determine a candidates potential to meet unmet medical needs in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)."
"Our approach involves evaluating the level of disease burden that exists, the availability of alternative medications and the appropriateness of our candidates to improve public health."
"For candidates with significant potential in underserved settings, access planning may start in the pre-clinical phase."
"Additionally, understanding where health system infrastructure and funding mechanisms are in place is an important component of enabling safe and effective usage, which ultimately facilitates meaningful patient access."
"Our R&D Governance Committee isaccountable for the evaluation process, and all recommendations arereviewed by our Public Policy and Responsibility Council (PPRC), aninternal cross-divisional forum of senior leaders."
"When a drug or vaccine candidate with the potential to address significant public health burden in underserved health care settings is identified, the access planning process includes engaging all parts of our enterprise, as well as external stakeholders, to identify the most optimal solution."
"Once a product is approved, we commit to registration and availability of the product in all countries where clinical trials have been conducted, including LMICs."
Products continue to be evaluated for their potential throughout their life cycle to account for changes in the external environment.
Sometimes the evaluation of a candidate reveals barriers to access inan underserved setting.
"In these situations, the evaluation process can inform our approach to strengthening health systems and improving health equity."
We recognize that addressing the complex and multi-faceted challenges to accessing health care in LMICs requires the collaboration of multiple stakeholders.
We actively seek partnerships to achieve solutions that enable access.
One example of our approach to early planning is our global access strategy for our Companys investigational COVID-19 antiviral candidate.
"In the face of the global pandemic, and realizing our opportunity to help meet a significant unmet medical need globally, including in under-resourced settings, we implemented a global strategy to facilitate timely and widespread access."
"To accelerate broad global access, our comprehensive supply and access approach includes producing millions of courses of our investigational COVID-19 antiviral candidate through our global network, which includes manufacturing sites in nine countries across three continents."
"Additionally, we have entered into advance purchase and supply agreements with the governments of several countries worldwide and are currently in discussions with additional governments."
We have signed voluntary license agreements with multiple established Indian generic manufacturers and the Medicines Patent Pool to facilitate the availability of generic versions of our medicine to more than 100 low- and middle-income countries.
"Through our licensing agreements with generics manufacturers and the Medicines Patent Pool, more than three million courses of generic therapy have been delivered to more than 15 low-and-middle-income markets included in the licenses through March 2022."
Weve also allocated up to three million courses of therapy to UNICEF for low-and-middle-income countries.

This commitment complements our voluntary license agreements with generic manufacturers and highlights the importance of actions from multiple stakeholders to effectively increase timely access to medicines for patients globally.
"Maintaining a global supply network Through our manufacturing and supply division, we strive to maintain a compliant, reliable and highest-quality global supply network."
"Our supply chain is designed to ensure we operate a lean and efficient network that produces our medicines and vaccines to the highest quality, safety and environmental standards in full compliance with regulations and Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) based on U."
S. and international requirements and industry best practices.
"Through digitally enabled end-to-end supply planning, we are digitizing our shop floors and conducting efficient and balanced planning decisions to maximize business results and deliver medicines and vaccines to customers, which include hospitals, retail outlets and patients, when and where they need them."
"With both an environmental and socially conscious mindset, our facilities, along with our external contractors, suppliers and partners, make up an integrated, interdependent global manufacturing network."
CONTINUED: GRI 203 | SASB 240a.1 | SASB 240a.2 | SASB 240b .2 | SASB 240b .3 Solving affordability challenges through dedicated sustainable access solutions We aspire to enable solutions and shape the ecosystem that delivers sustainable access to innovative medicines for patients.
"We collaborate with different stakeholders, including private, governmental, multilateral and non-profit organizations, to design and deliver solutions that address the access challenges at the payer, provider and patient levels."
Our approach is predicated on the belief that broadening access requires sustained effort and is best achieved through solving the underlying challenges in the health care system that constrain access for patients from care delivery to capacity and financing.
"We also believe that we exist within a wider ecosystem, comprising multiple stakeholders, each playing a unique and varied role."
"Therefore, key to our approach is a focus on solutions and collaboration that help make access to care affordable."
We have focused on making this approach systematic.
"We have established a framework, which is available to all our markets, for assessing, designing and delivering practical solutions that solve access and affordability challenges."
"We have also established a dedicated internal unit to systematically accelerate innovation, develop the relevant capabilities and capture learnings across various countries."
Through this approach we have been able to accelerate the development of innovation in patient access models and solutions to expand the accessible population across the globe.
We also recognize that the policy environment is critical to solving access and affordability challenges.
"Therefore, we engage with governments, industry associations, trade and economic forums, think tanks and academia to advocate for evidence-based policy solutions."
"For example, we are actively involved in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperations (APEC) Health Financing initiatives including the creation of a roadmap that outlines priorities, objectives and targets for strengthening health care financing, sharing best practices from APEC economies and strengthening the dialogue across industry, governments and academia to diagnose and solve pressing affordability challenges."
"Similarly, we are engaged in the Global Coalition for Value in Healthcare to accelerate the transition to value-based health care throughout the world."

2 The significant decrease in people reached in 2020 and 2021 vs 2019 is due to postponed mass drug administration programs as well as shipping delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.
"We expand access to our products through dedicated, market-based sustainable access solutions that expand the reach to at-need populations and patients including those in LMICstaking into consideration public health need, economic conditions and health care infrastructure."
"Our current portfolio of projects is focused on dedicated sustainable access solutions globally, inclusive of the U."
S. and LMICs.
"These projects are in various stages of development, from diagnosing theaccess challenges to delivering solutions in the market."
"We operate as an integrated Company across global, regional and market teams to address affordability through multiple initiatives."
The goal is always consistent: helping to establish a more sustainable access environment that delivers broader and more equitable access tomedicines and vaccines for people wherever they might be.
"For example, one of the recurring access challenges in LMICs is the potentially high out-of-pocket costs for critical illness treatments."
"Recognizing this issue, we have continued collaboration with reinsurers and insurance companies in South Africa, Thailand and Indonesia to enable them to develop affordable health insurance products for the population, including covering innovative cancer therapies."
We are also actively collaborating with public health authorities through a public-private partnership to provide access to immunotherapy financing via supplemental medical insurance in China.
This provides much needed optionality for the population and drives greater health care inclusion.
"As the reach of insurance products further expands, we expect major access hurdles to be solved and access to innovative cancer therapies for patients widened in a commercially sustainable way."
"Thiscollaborative approach to addressing out-of-pocket costs Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 60 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices reinforces our commitment to being part of a wider ecosystem, collaborating with others with complementary capabilities to tackle these challenges."
Additional information on sustainable solutions for innovative treatments can be found on the sustainable access website.
"We also recognize that in some environments, the challenge lies in having resilient health care systems able to reach patients at the right time with the right intervention."
That is why we also collaborate with health care and service providers to understand challenges in the care pathway and help advance solutions that can establish a more efficient and effective health care system.
"Our efforts focus on utilizing our deep clinical understanding, particularly in oncology, to better understand inefficiencies in the pathway and the use of infrastructure and services, and to help support health care system efforts to achieve more impact with the same or less resources."
"Through these efforts, health care systems might better ensure that people receive the care they need when they need it, whether to treat or prevent disease, while also better coping with growing fiscal pressures."
Addressing barriers to access Pursuing health equityaddressing preventable differences in the burden of disease and health outcomesis deeply embedded in our DNA.
"Through partnerships, investment and innovation, we apply our expertise and invest our human and financial resources to address systemic barriers to access to health where we believe we can make the strongest contributions to health systems, communities and our patients around the world."

Currently we conduct our clinical trials in more than 50countries worldwide.
"Internally, we have a team of clinical trial operations experts focused on promoting the inclusion of diverse patients and identifying and implementing best practices in the conduct of clinical trials globally."
This begins with selection of clinical trial sites in communities serving underrepresented ethnic groups.
"We provide resources and training to increase awareness of the importance of, and best practices for, inclusion of underrepresented populations in clinical research."
"Clinical research studies sponsored by our Company also are being planned and conducted in a way that incorporates enrollment and other diversity- focused goals, to help drive inclusion and access across our programs with our clinical trial sites."
"Externally, we continue to be a vocal contributor and participant in various partnerships and sponsorships intended to connect with, support and train more diverse U."

"S. underserved populations, progress on internal efforts is tracked using a key performance indicator dashboard that is reported into an internal Health Equity Steering Committee comprised of senior leaders."
"The KPI dashboard enables alignment, accountability, and transparency and acceleration of efforts across the organization."
"Investments in capabilities building We are making a commitment to our people, investing in our talent to strengthen their capabilities and evolve our ways of working."
"In 2022, we launched a $1 million Health Equity Catalyst Fund to empower teams at the local and regional levels to create solutions that promote more equitable health outcomes and care experiences, particularly for populations who are underserved, by engaging at the community level to remove barriers to care and/or strengthening health systems to deliver on high quality and accountable care."
"We are investing in strengthening internal data capabilities to ensure we can utilize and apply social determinants of health data to support the design and rollout of effective solutions and partnerships, as well as track key metrics that help us to better understand the impact of our actions/investments."
"We are ensuring that our employees have the latest knowledge and data through the development of training resources, guidelines, tools and a new health equity learning network."
"Vaccines Key accomplishments and milestones The total number of our vaccine doses that have been distributed has increased significantly since 2013, and our global reach has also increased dramatically."
"In 2021, approximately 76 percent of our vaccines were distributed outside the U."
"S., up from 34 percent in 2013."
"More than 73 million doses of two of our vaccinesGARDASIL [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and RotaTeq (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent)have been distributed in Gavi-eligible countries through 2021."
This represents important progress toward ensuring that these vaccines reach people in low-income settings who are at high risk for certain vaccine-preventable illnesses.
"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 63 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices By December 2019, ERVEBO (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) had been approved by the U."
"S. FDA and conditionally approved by the European Medicines Agency, received WHO prequalification and been approved in two African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi."
"As of April 2022, the vaccine has also been approved in nine African countries, the United Kingdom and Switzerland."
"In January 2021, our Company confirmed an agreement with UNICEF toestablish the worlds first global Ebola vaccine stockpile with ERVEBO, which represents a new and important tool in supporting future outbreak preparedness and response efforts."
The stockpile inventory isbeing built over time and will be maintained by our Company.
"Since establishing the agreement to build the stockpile, we have been working with UNICEF to deliver licensed doses."
"As of August 2022, the currently available doses of licensed vaccine in the stockpile is over 400,000."
"The global stockpile, governed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision, will offer a critical, rapid- response tool to help combat future outbreaks of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus."
"Access pricing We work with governments, international health and development organizations, donor groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and others to support countries population health aims and help improve sustainable vaccinationprograms."
"Our commitment to helping protect global health by improving the affordability, availability, accessibility and use of our vaccines around the world is fundamental to our business and overall purpose."
"We offer GARDASIL, which is indicated to help reduce the risk of certain HPV-related diseases later in life, at an access price that is significantly less than the value-based price in other countries."
"The access price for vaccines is exclusive to the public sectors of the countries eligible for support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance."
"In 2015, we extended our current Gavi prices for GARDASIL through 2025 to Gavi-graduated countries with a per-capita gross national income (GNI) not exceeding $3,200, as well as Gavi-accelerated transition or fully self-financing countries that meet Gavis Exceptional Opportunity criteria."
"This greatly assists countries that have transitioned out of Gavi support by facilitating access to these vaccines in those countries, while also ensuring that they remain affordable and sustainable in the long term."
"In the short period of time since we made our price commitment to countries transitioning out of Gavi support, numerous countries have taken advantage of the offer to introduce or continue existing national HPV vaccination programs."
We also remain actively engaged with Gavi on policy efforts to improve access to vaccines in Gavi-transitioned countries.
"We believe that our pricing approach contributes to broader access to our vaccines while taking into account our need to continue investing in vaccine research, development and production."
"Manufacturing and supply In the last few years, countries around the world have enacted new or expanded vaccination programs."
This has contributed to an unprecedented increase in global demand for vaccines.
We are committed to increasing our capacity and supply capability.
"Our commitment across the Company to invest in capital projects over five years has increased to $20 billion, with a portion dedicated to vaccines."
"We continue to invest in manufacturing and end-to-end supply improvements in both capability and capacity to help ensure a sustainable, reliable supply of quality and affordable vaccines to serve global needs."
"Our manufacturing division continuously works to improve manufacturing processes and reduce operating costs by increasing efficiency, minimizing procurement spending and improving supply performance."
Maintaining product quality is paramount.
"To provide high-quality vaccines to people who need them, we manage our supply chain through policies and procedures designed to keep the distribution system secure."
That is why we continue to explore potential strategic partnerships with other manufacturers to increase supply and promote greater access in local markets.
"COVID-19 manufacturing agreements In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we entered multiple agreements to support efforts to expand the manufacturing capacity and supply of COVID-19 medicines and vaccines."

"S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), we received funding that allowed us to adapt and make available a number of existing manufacturing facilities for the production of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines."
Registration and prequalification We seek to ensure global access to our vaccines by obtaining and maintaining up-to-date product registrations around the globe.
"In order to make our products available to the people who need them throughout the world, we registered 141 products and devices in 2021."
"The majority of these products were registered in LMICs in the Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Americas regions."
"In addition to having our medicines and vaccines approved by stringent regulatory authorities, when relevant to enhancing access in LMICs we also work to have certain medicines and vaccines prequalified through the WHO prequalification process so that our products may be easily obtained and distributed to underserved populations."
The table below summarizes the registration and WHO prequalification status of a select list of our vaccines.
CONTINUED: GRI 203 | SASB 240a.1 | SASB 240a.2 | SASB 240b .2 | SASB 240b .3 WHO prequalification can facilitate product procurement by international procurement agencies.
"WHOs prequalification program covers medicines for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, neglected tropical diseases, influenza, reproductive health and diarrhea, in addition to vaccines."
"In the absence of reliable national medicine authorities that can certify that health care products meet required quality, safety and efficacy standards, stringent regulatory authority and WHO prequalification can serve as a basis for quality assurance for procurement by international agencies and national programs in lower- income countries."
We have made efforts to address the unique needs of low-income countries where the infrastructure and personnel to deliver immunization services can be severely limited.
"Specifically, we focused on product improvements that included features such as vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) and use in controlled-temperature-chain conditions."
"In May 2022, we obtained WHO Prequalification for GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 vaccines compatibility for use outside the cold chain for up to four days."
This helps enhance accessibility for hard-to-reach populations.

"Bribery and corruption are illegal, tarnish our reputation and undermine public trust."
Offering or paying bribes or kickbacks is against the laws of the markets where we do business.
We are committed to observing the laws and regulations that govern our operations and activities wherever we do business.
"To that end, we maintain policies, procedures and processes that apply to Company activities involving transfer of value (TOV), including TOV to HCPs and third-party intermediaries that perform agreed-to services on our behalf."
"We have a well-established global ethics and compliance program that is consistent with the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) Code of Practice requirements, as well as with other applicable regional or country industry codes of conduct, including those issued by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA)."
"Our Board of Directors and senior management, including the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, provide the foundational elements of leadership, accountability and structure to oversee the Companys global ethics and compliance program."
"The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer reports directly to our CEO, and provides regular updates to senior leaders and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on key indicators of ethical culture and compliance and risk trends."
This reporting structure supports transparent and independent communication of relevant risk information relating to ethics and compliance issues.
"Our Companys anti-bribery/anticorruption program and policies give employees (and third-parties with whom we engage) the awareness, knowledge and resources to operate with integrity and comply with applicable laws and regulations, and to understand that we will not tolerate any act, or even the appearance, of impropriety."

The policy also prohibits any act that may give the appearance of offering anything of value for a business advantage.
"It applies to direct engagements (i.e., those conducted by our Company) aswell as to indirect engagements (i.e., those managed through a third- party intermediary or partner)."
There are additional divisional policies reinforcing these principles in connection with certain activities.
Our Business Partner Code of Conduct presents similar and consistent principles for our business partners.
"It states that business partners shall not offer pay, ask for or accept anything of valueor give the appearance that they doin order to improperly influence decisions or actions with respect to any Company business or government activities."
"We expect all our business partners to adhere to these principles and operate in full compliance, including maintaining processes and procedures to prevent and detect corrupt activities."
GRI 205-2 Communications and training on anticorruption Annual ethics and policy certification An important component of our corporate ethics and compliance program is our annual ethics and policy certification.
"The annual review process requires selected employees to certify adherence to the Code of Conduct and corporate policies on preventing bribery and corruption, antitrust-law compliance, conflict of interest and insider trading."
"These employees are also expected to regulate their outside activities to avoid any conflicts of interest and to certify, in writing, whether actual or potential conflicts of interest exist."
"Where potential conflicts are identified, the Office of Ethics will work with management to take actions to mitigate the potential conflict."
"In addition, U."
"S.-based (including Puerto Rico) employees must certify compliance with our policy on the effects of exclusions, debarments, suspensions and health care-related criminal convictions, reporting and screening."
The annual compliance certification process is supplemented by periodic market and regional risk-based discussions and ongoing risk data monitoring.
Training is an important part of creating a strong ethics and compliance culture.
"To ensure that all employees understand our ethical expectations and principles, we provide an annual ethics and compliance training series that includes relevant content to enable employees to perform with integrity and to make appropriate value- based decisions in the course of their work."
"In 2021, more than 99 percent of our employees completed assigned training on four specific modules: Code of Conduct Speaking up Anti-bribery and anti-corruption Privacy Supplemental training on anti-bribery and anti-corruption is provided for employees who engage with non-U."

"While ours is a competitive industry where it is important that we compete aggressively, it is equally important that we do so fairly, legally and based on the merits of our products and services."
"Our interactions with customers, suppliers and competitors are governed by antitrust and competition laws and corporate policies."
We enforce these external and internal standards through our ethics and compliance program.
"We recognize that our reputation for integrity, trust, honesty and fair dealing continues to be dependent on our ethical practices."
"Consequently, we want to make certain that the ways in which we promote customer choice, business relationships and business practices are positive and fair."
"Our professional sales representatives are guided through our policies to recognize that competitive advantage is gained through the merits of our products and services, never through unethical or illegal business practices."
"Fostering pro-competition practices We believe that our marketing, sales, and advertising activities make an important contribution to medicine by informing our customers of treatment options based on the most recent scientific information and findings from rigorous clinical studies."
"Our sales and marketing practices are governed by external laws andregulations and industry codes of conduct, and by our own global Code of Conduct, our corporate policies and procedures, and our ethics and compliance program."
"Our ethics and compliance program seeks to address and prevent inappropriate practices, and we evaluate our policies and practices as appropriate."
"Our practices are monitored, and compliance is enforced, to ensure that our interactions with customers and consumers do not include making unsubstantiated competitive claims."
"Also, a part of the business requires the Company to communicate with policy makers or other stakeholders to address certain gaps in a market and promote patient access."
"In such interactions, we are careful not to develop tactics aimed at preventing or delaying access of generic products into the market and such communications are governed by our marketing communications principles."
Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 80 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices GRI 206-1 Anti-competitive behavior All new employees receive training and testing and must be certified on relevant policies and our Companys ethical operating standards.
"Although many of our employees who market and sell our medicines and vaccines have advanced scientific or medical degrees and backgrounds, all our sales representatives must complete general sales and product training."
Training is specific to the country where an employee is based and covers the scope of the employees responsibilities in ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
We stress that if our employees are unsure about the appropriateness of the conduct that they ask for help.
There are several places where employees can turn for assistance.
The first option is to talk with their manager.
"If they do not feel comfortable with that course of action, the other resources they maycontact are: Divisional Compliance Departments Office of Ethics Privacy Office Office of General Counsel Human Resources Department MSDethics.com In addition to mandatory training on our Code of Conduct, employees receive training on other levels of business practice and compliance according to their roles and responsibilities."
We evaluate and update the content for all marketing and sales training periodically to ensure that it remains relevant and current.
"While antitrust and competition laws may differ in the countries where our Company operates, the fundamental principles remain the same."
"From a broad perspective, antitrust and competition laws are legislated to promote competitive markets with the notion that when competitors and sellers can compete effectively against each other, customers will be the ultimate beneficiary."
"All employees are educated on the overall principles and, with the help of the relevant legal and compliance functions, they are expected to carry out their duties in a pro-competitive manner while safeguarding and advancing the Companys interests."
"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 81 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Tax GRI 207-1 Approach to tax We recognize our role as a responsible taxpayer to pay our full share of taxes, including corporate income taxes."
We also recognize that our contribution is much more than the corporate income tax we pay.
"We pay a significant amount of taxes to national and local governments in the form of employment taxes, value-added taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, property taxes and customs duties."
We also collect numerous taxes paid by our employees.
We pay all taxes due in full and on time in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
"The way we conduct business, including the economic impact from the taxes we pay, also reflects our commitment to striving to reach those in need with our medicines and vaccines and helping to build robust, durable health systems worldwide through partnership, investment and innovation."
Our chief financial officer (CFO) is ultimately responsible for our overall tax position.
"The day-to-day management of tax is performed by the Companys global corporate tax department, which is led by the senior vice president of Tax."
"Effective oversight of the tax function is maintained by at least an annual tax presentation to the Audit Committee of our Board and regular meetings with the CFO; senior vice president, Tax and Treasury; and other executive leaders to discuss emerging tax matters."
We comply with tax rules and regulations on a worldwide basis and only engage in tax planning that is aligned with our commercial business activities and reputation.
We are committed to the arms length standard in transfer pricing and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines for international tax matters.
We have a zero-tolerance approach to tax evasion and the facilitation of tax evasion.
"Where uncertainty exists, and when appropriate, we seek clarification from our external advisors and/ or governmental authorities."
This can take the form of tax rulings or advanced pricing agreements from governmental authorities.
"We monitor proposals and changes to tax incentives and regulations in the countries in which we operate in order to assess their impact on our business, and we actively participate in industry groups interacting with government representatives to support the development of effective tax systems that encourage innovation and growth."
"We utilize available tax incentives and opportunities, such as Research andDevelopment tax reliefs, in the spirit in which they were intended."

"Materials GRI 301 Management approach By using more efficient and innovative processing methods and technologies, we are reducing the amount of energy, water and raw materials we use to make our products, thereby minimizing the amount of waste we generate."
"We go to great lengths to ensure that our products are designed and made in a safe, effective and environmentally sound manner."
We deliver on this commitment by maintaining a highly trained and capable scientific staff and by actively pursuing manufacturing process improvements that minimize environmental impacts.
We have set environmental sustainability goals with concrete targets and timelines to demonstrate this commitment.
"To ensure that our knowledge stays current with that of thought leaders and experts in the industry, we also collaborate with external resources and industry groups, such as the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA)."
"Products We conduct extensive testing of our products to identify and understand any potential safety, health and environmental hazards."
"We manage and communicate information about hazardous materials to keep our employees, contractors, transporters and other partners safe."
We are actively engaged in conversations on product stewardship to understandand act on the issues specific to our industry worldwide.
"We share best practices within the industry via our membership in the Conference Board Product Stewardship Council, the American Chemistry Councils (ACC) Green Chemistry Initiative, the EFPIA, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) andthe ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS GCIPR)."
Our objective is to maintain compliance and assure supply of life-saving medicines as we look to further minimize our future environmental footprint.
Governance Our efforts in this area are overseen by our Green & Sustainable Science Steering Committee and our Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)Council.
Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 83 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Programs and initiatives Our chemists and engineers are trained in green-design principles and are provided with tools and resources to help them develop manufacturing processes that use safer chemicals and reduced quantities of raw materials.
"We use innovations like nanotechnology tomake our products more effective, while ensuring that product safety always remains of utmost importance."
Complying with chemical substance and product requirements is a top priority for us.
We track numerous existing and emerging chemical control regulations that require us to register specific types of chemicals with the proper authorities.
"To meet these requirements, our scientists complete assessments of the environmental and human health risks of the substances with which we work and submit the required regulatory notifications."
"Additionally, we provide details on product use and risk-based control measures in accordance with applicable regulations."
"Packaging Our product stewardship program extends to our customers and patients through the design of effective, low-impact product packaging."
"Our Company also supports the development of science based, cost-effective and environmentally sound programs that promote the proper disposal of unused medicines and their packaging in accordance with regional requirements."
"For more information, see our position statement on responsible disposal of medicines, which can be found on our corporate website."
"The materials we use for packaging our finished products serve a range of important purposes; the foremost purpose is to protect the purity, efficacy and physical integrity of the product."
"Packaging also provides the customer with information and convenience, the pharmacist or provider with accurate dispensing information at the point of purchase and our business with marketing value."
"For some products, packaging also serves safety functions such as child resistance and tampering evidence."
"In addition to these critical functions of packaging, there is also the consideration of the environmental impact of the materials we use."
"After it has served its critical function(s), packaging becomes our customers waste and therefore must be accounted for in our designs."
"We have adopted Design for Environment practices that help our engineers design new product packages that are better for the environment by minimizing package sizes and using more environmentally friendly materials, where possible."
"As a standard business practice, we review all of our new human health packaging designs prior to launch to understand and minimize environmental impacts as much as possible, while still providing adequate protection for our products."
"To help us evaluate the differences in environmental impacts between packaging options, we use a simplified life-cycle assessment (LCA) tool that provides information on the environmental impacts generated by the materials used in our packaging."
"In addition, we are working to establish foundational, environmentally- focused packaging principles for the future of our packaging design."
"These principles, in addition to our LCA tool, serve to guide decision making for packaging design."
"We continue to monitor global trends around material use, such as the New Plastics Economy, and how we might incorporate circular economy concepts into the critical functions of packaging for pharmaceuticals."
"It is unclear how these trends will impact our industry, however, these are important signals of a changing external approach to the use and recovery of specific materials like fiber-based products, plastics such as PVC, metals and others."
Governance Packaging design is managed by the Global Pharmaceutical Operations area of the Company with oversight from our Environmental Health and Safety Council.
"In 2021, we responded to the CDP forest questionnaire for timber products, specifically for paper and secondary and tertiary packaging."
"CDP graded our disclosure with a C Awareness rating, indicating that we have Knowledge of impacts on, and of, forests issues."
"According to CDP, our Company is among 60 percent of companies that reached Awareness level in our Activity Group (Biotech and pharma) for timber."
We performed a gap assessment of our questionnaire response and developed a roadmap for improvements in this area over the next several years.
We are in the early stages of our program development and are in the process of assessing the impact of other forest risk commodities.

"Because of their significance to our business and the life-cycle impact they represent, we focus on designing our processes to minimize or avoid their use where practical."
"Where we do use solvents, we maximize efficiency and control them in our emissions, effluents and waste."
"We have an active Green and Sustainable Science program (see page 86) to design our new processes using fewer, less toxic, solvents and other hazardous materials, and to reuse and recycle more of the solvents we do use."
"For cleaning our manufacturing equipment, we use water-based methods where they are as effective as solvents."
"At each of our manufacturing sites, we have engineers who are responsible for identifying and driving process-improvement projects."
"When it is not practical to reuse regenerated solvents in our own productionprocesses, we work with suppliers who recover the spent solvents for resale to other industries or safely burn them as a source of energy, where feasible."
Any used solvents that leave our site as hazardous waste are managed at off-site facilities that are on our list ofapproved waste management sites.
"Chemical management A comprehensive and effective chemical management program is critical to the safety and protection of our employees, the communities in which we operate and the environment."
"We have put in place procedures, systems and processes to manage the approval, procurement, inventory, receipt, transfer, storage, use and disposal of chemicals at all of our sites."

Green and sustainable science is the design of new products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances.
"The concept applies across the life cycle of a product, including its design, manufacture, use and ultimate disposal."
There is a trend towards more regulatory restrictions and increased oversight in many jurisdictions around the world.
Our strategy for green and sustainable commercial chemical route development could help to avoid potential future issues in the supply chain.
"Our Companys overall objective is to be viewed as the industry leader for the development of innovative, efficient, green and sustainable commercial syntheses of our small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from sustainable commodity raw materials."
We are also exploring ways to reduce the environmental impact of biologics and vaccine manufacturing.
Governance Our Companys Process Research and Development department is responsible for process development.
"The progress toward our goals is overseen by various internal bodies including the Scientific Advisory Council (SAC), the Development and Commercialization Oversight (DCO) and our Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Council."
Strategy Our integrated strategy involves several stages and aims to provide innovative solutions rather than incremental improvements to historical practices.
"We see transformative science/ engineering and innovation as critical enablers to developing sustainable, low-cost manufacturing processes that provide both environmental and economic benefits over the life cycles of our products."
"We aim to develop the most efficient and sustainable processes at product launch, with the goal of minimizing material use and waste from our commercial manufacturing."
Our Companys research laboratories utilize an innovative green-by-design development strategy to progress from an initial early clinical supply route to a fully optimized and sustainable commercial manufacturingprocess.
"Programs andinitiatives As part of our Green & Sustainable Science program, we calculate the process mass intensity (PMI) of our small molecule human health products."
PMI represents the number of kilograms of raw materials (including water) used to produce one kilogram of an API.
PMI indicates the efficiency by which we convert raw materials into final products.
"We use this metric internally to compare different manufacturing methods, identify process improvement opportunities and track our progress."
We have developed aggressive PMI targets for our API processes that leverage an internally developed SMART PMI tool and regularly evaluate PMI at every stage of development.
We continue to use this tool to drive the development of all our new small molecule processes to achieve our aspirational goals for green and sustainable processes.
"For our large molecule processes, we are still evaluating different sustainability metrics and ways to reduce the environmental impact of biologics and vaccinemanufacturing."
We are also using LCA tools to further evaluate theenvironmental impacts of our processes.

Our Energy Management Standard requires responsible and efficient energy management and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions.
"Energy-demand reduction and efficiency will always be part of our energy management strategy, as it positively impacts our efforts to reduce our global footprint."
Utilization of renewable energy is a growing expectation of industry.
"The advancements in renewable technology, and incentives through legislation, have facilitated the creation of a robust renewable energymarket."
Programs and initiatives We have made it a priority to reduce our demand for energy and have established internal policies and practices focused on reducing energy use at our sites and minimizing GHG generation throughout the Company.
"By taking these steps, we are not only minimizing GHG emissions but also reducing our operating costs and mitigating the business impacts expected to be associated with future climate change requirements."
Energy-efficiency and demand-reduction projects will continue to contribute to reducing both our energy consumption and direct GHG emissions.
"In addition, we will continue to optimize systems, consolidate excess facility space when possible and utilize renewable energy sources."
"We have launched initiatives around the world to improve energy use, reduce GHG emissions from our operations and understand our supply chain-related impacts."
"Our Global Energy & Sustainability Center of Excellence (CoE) identifies, shares and standardizes best practices and prioritizes the funding of energy projects to reduce energy use across our Company."
"Our manufacturing facilities, warehouses, laboratories, offices and vehicle fleet are the primary targets of our energy-demand-reduction programs, as they represent the majority of our energy consumption."
"Our Sustainability Capital Fund is used exclusively for sustainability projects at sites around the world that bring long-term value to the Company, and focuses on carbon footprint, water use and solid waste reduction."
"The fund allocates up to $12 million per year to adopt low- carbon technology, better position us to respond to climate change and support a more circular economy."
"Since 2015, our sites have completed more than 124 projects through the Sustainability Capital Fund, which has avoided the production of an estimated 50,000 metric tons of carbon emissions per year."
Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 88 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Facilities We continuously strive to make our facilities energy-efficient.
Our Global Energy & Sustainability CoE has created an energy road map to help our facilities reduce energy demand and associated GHG emissions.
The energy road maps foundation includes large-scale metering and monitoring to assess and identify opportunities for continuous improvement.
"As facility energy-management programs mature, energy savings are sought by improving the reliability of the equipment, the efficient operation of utility systems and building efficiencies into systems design."
We have also created a Low Carbon Transition Playbook (LCTP).
The LCTP was a result of a cross-functional effort at our Company that pulled together experts into a design-thinking workshop organized to develop strategies to reduce GHG emissions.
The LCTP includes a gap assessment for sites to evaluate the maturity of their energy programs and helps create short- and long-term plans to reduce sites carbon intensity and build toward a low carbon future.
All our new facilities are required to comply with our Energy Design Guide and Energy Conservation Planner.
"When we purchase a facility, it is evaluated for energy efficiency and assessed against our energy scorecard as part of its integration into our Company."
"All new laboratories, offices and major renovations are built following cost-effective and energy-efficient practices, and are designed to meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, or a comparable country standard (e.g."
"BREEAM, EXEED, HQE, etc.)."
Offices and laboratories are expected to achieve LEED Gold certification at a minimum.

Our process is as follows: 1.
The World Resource Institutes (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool is used as an initial step to map water risk.
"Sites are categorized annually using the Baseline Water Stress indicator, which is the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to total annual renewable supply and accounts for upstream consumptive use."
Higher stress values indicate more competition among water users.
2.
Sites that are identified as high risk are further assessed utilizing a catchment-specific approach to confirm that the catchments are experiencing high water stress.
3.
"Sites that are known to experience water risk, regardless of the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool assessment, are included as high- risk sites."
4.
"Water conservation plans are put in place at high-risk sites that use more than 100,000 m3 of water per year."
"We work with a third party, water-use expert to evaluate opportunities for water-use reductions at these sites, resulting in site-specific water conservation plans."
5.
Sites that do not meet the water-use threshold will continue to be monitored for operational risk and conservation plans will be put in place as needed.
Performing this assessment ensures that we can adapt our strategy to changing stressors in each catchment.
It enables us to better prioritize facilities and catchments for water stewardship activities and lays the foundation for potential future water targets in priority locations.
"In 2021, the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool identified two of our manufacturing and/or research facilities as being in areas with extremely high Baseline Water Stress and eight as being in areas with high Baseline Water Stress."
"In 2021, there were three fewer sites in areas of extremely high risk than in 2020 due to changes to our site network."
"As a result of the above methodology, we have two sites that have water conservation plans in place."
"GRI 303-2 Water discharge-related impacts We conduct environmental risk assessments on our products (small molecules, biologics and vaccines) from the development phase through product launch, to understand and manage product impacts both from manufacturing and patient use."
"We assess products in a manner consistent with the most stringent applicable global regulations, including the regulatory review processes of the U."
S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.
"Product environmental safety profiles are reassessed during periodic renewals of product filings, and risk-mitigation actions are implemented when needed."
"We use the information from our risk assessments to establish or update our internal, compound-specific Environmental Quality Criteria (EQCs), which are used to confirm that wastewaters discharged from our facilities do not contain levels of residual products that present a risk to human health or the environment."
"Our manufacturing facilities are required to use these EQCs, along with industry-accepted risk- assessment methods, to establish procedures for managing and controlling active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in their wastewater."
"Each facility uses the internal EQC standards to: Assess the potential risk from its operations using science-based and industry-accepted risk assessment methods Minimize environmental impacts from wastewater discharges in the local watershed Establish procedures for managing, treating or controlling APIs in wastewater prior to discharge where needed Our production facilities have, or will be provided with, API-treatment technology such as advanced oxidation where needed, so that our wastewater discharges meet both regulatory requirements and these internal standards."

Water withdrawal is variable based on manufacturing and research activities year to year.
"Approximately 13 percent of the total water we used in 2021 was supplied from surface water sources, and 50 percent was supplied by groundwater water sources, with the balance sourced from municipal water supplies."
Our sites employ a variety of technologies and techniques aimed at reducing our water footprint and improving operational performance.
"Closed-loop cooling systems, which reduce freshwater use, are employed at many of our facilities worldwide."
Reverse osmosis (RO) reject water is reused for non-potable and non-process applications such as cooling tower feed water.
"In all, 1.0 million cubic meters of water was recovered, reused or recycled at our facilities in 2021, whichis equivalent to five percent of our total water use."
"Our water-use-reduction initiatives include: Consideration of water use in process design Cooling-system optimization Prompt repairs and maintenance of steam-distribution systemsand traps Recovery and reuse of steam condensate and reject water Process-water purification system optimization Avoiding the use of water in mechanical seals, such as those in pumps An innovative project was completed at MSD Oss Biotech in the Netherlands in 2021."
The site constructed an energy-neutral site entrance building and a new parking area for staff and visitors.
Underneath the parking area a large underground rainwater storage area was created.
"During heavy showers, the basin collects and stores rainwater for soil infiltration."
"As a result of climate change, maintaining groundwater levels has proved to be increasingly challenging, even in a relatively wet country such as the Netherlands."
"This initiative not only reduces the amount of rainwater discharged to the sewer, but also has a beneficial impact on the surrounding areas ecosystem."
"In 2021, the Sustainability Capital Fund was utilized to fund water reduction projects at our site in Rahway, New Jersey."
These projects included a smart irrigation system and condensate return projects.

This is predicted to rise dramatically as climate change continues and population grows.
"Without biodiversity, ecosystem services are not as productive, which, along with other things, exacerbates the rate of climate change."
"To slow climate change, we need to slow biodiversity loss by aligning our demands withnature's ability to produce and safely absorb our waste."
Loss of biodiversity will reduce our ability to discover and develop medicines.
Plants and bacteria are well-recognized sources of new medicines.
"According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), more than half of the worlds total gross domestic product, or $44 trillion, involves activities that are moderately or highly dependent on nature, including around half of pharmaceutical products."
"While we recognize that protecting biodiversity is important to the planet and our Companys growth, we do not fully understand the impacts we have on biodiversity either directly or indirectly through our products."
"We do, however, have a long history of managing pharmaceuticals in the environment and remediation projects."
"These actions prevent and reduce pollution in the areas in which we operate, protecting species and ecosystems from harm."
We are currently conducting an ingredient risk assessment to better understand if the sourcing of certain inputs to the manufacture of our products potentially contribute to global deforestation.
"This assessment is in support of our CDP Forest response, which includes high-risk deforestation commodities such as timber, palm oil derivatives, soy, cattle by-products and rubber."
The results of this assessment will be incorporated into our responsible sourcing strategy.
Each of our sites in Ireland has developed a biodiversity team to perform biodiversity assessments.
"These sites worked with external biodiversity professionals to identify areas that could be improved from a biodiversity perspective, with particular emphasis on pollinators such as wild bees and butterflies."
"As a result of our commitment to these actions, we are delighted to announce that MSD Dunboyne has been awarded accreditation to the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan (AIPP)."
"The AIPP is run by the National Biodiversity Data Centre and aims to reverse the dramatic downward trend in the number of pollinators in Ireland over the past decade by supporting businesses, communities and individuals to take small actions to help our native pollinators."
"Animal Health and biodiversity Through our Animal Health aqua business, our Company monitors numerous aquatic species by utilizing passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags."
"In 2021, we sold over four million PIT tags which provide lifetime identification and tracking for the animals they tag."
The technology can also be used to provide real-time monitoring of fish and wildlife without impacting their natural behavior.
"The insights gleaned from the monitoring data allow for more accurate estimations of wild populations, survival rates and migration patterns."
"That data provides fish and wildlife managers with information for the conservation of keystone, threatened and endangered species."
"These tools also track invasive species, helping researchers assess how these animals distribute throughout the environment and interact with native flora and fauna."
The management of invasive population spread is a key factor to maintaining current levels of native species and encouraging recovery of endangered species.
Characterizing the spread of invasive species also allows stakeholders to predict how that spread may be influenced by human-impacted habitat and ecosystems.
"When stakeholders initiate a habitat restoration or enhancement project, these tools aide researchers in adaptive management by measuring the projects benefits on animal species."
This data refines mitigation of habitat degradation while also improving overall ecosystem health.
"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 102 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices GRI 304-3 Habitats protected or restored Since 2016, as part of our UN CEO Water Mandate commitment, wehave invested annually in habitat restoration and/or reforestation projects that improve water quality, restore biodiversity and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere."
"Working with organizations such as The Nature Conservancy and One Tree Planted, we have identified projects near our sites in which to invest."
"By investing in watershed management with these collective-action projects, we have also been able to integrate community mobilization by facilitating volunteer opportunities for our employees that live near our sites and for the communities in which they reside."
"For more information on the most recent water-related projects, please see GRI 303 on page 93 for more information."
Our Neighbor of Choice program supports the work of local nonprofit organizations dedicated to the wellbeing of community residents in areas where we have a presence.
"Through charitable grants and employee volunteerism, we support community efforts to improve the health and quality of life for underserved populations."
"This includes support for projects that protect the environment and/or environmental health of the local community, improve the quality of local water sources, mitigate the impacts of climate change, reduce waste generation and improve waste recycling capabilities."
"For example, in 2021 we provided a $50,000 charitable grant to the Shenandoah National Park Trust to support biodiversity and climate change resilience in the Shenandoah National Park and surrounding region."
"Our support helped the Shenandoah National Park Trust to identify and remove targeted invasive plants in high-priority acres, plantnative trees, treat threatened tree species and support volunteers."
"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 103 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Emissions GRI 305 Management approach Scientific data support that climate change is occurring, and we are taking action to reduce the economic and public health risks associated with a changing climate."
We have adopted a set of environmental sustainability goals to help position our Company to succeed in an increasingly resource-constrained world.
"These were developed to address the rising expectations of our customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees regarding the environmental impact of our operations and supply chain."
We have made progress on these goals and remain on track to achieve them.
We continue to find ways to decrease energy demand and have increased the amount of renewable energy we purchase.
Our procurement team is engaging our strategic suppliers in our efforts to reduce the environmental footprint outside of our operations.
"In our Business Partner Code of Conduct, we request that suppliers conserveenergy and engage in activities aimed at reducing greenhouse gasemissions."

"We will achieve carbon neutrality in our operations with ongoing innovation to increase energy efficiency, applying sustainable building standards and continuing to transition away from fossil fuel use."
"Remaining Scope 1 emissions will be balanced each year by investing in high-quality carbon offsets, including carbon removal offsets."
"Governance Our climate strategy is overseen by our Environmental Sustainability Center of Excellence (CoE), in partnership with our Global Energy & Sustainability CoE and Energy Procurement CoE."
"Each CoE reviews and reports data, monitors progress and provides assistance as needed to support sites work toward meeting our goals and review potential virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs)."
Leadership from the Environmental Sustainability CoE and Global Energy & Sustainability CoE meet quarterly with an internal Environmental Sustainability Steering Committee to provide updates on progress and to seek guidance on our initiatives.
"Furthermore, the EHS Council is responsible for approving new corporate environmental sustainability goals that the Environmental Sustainability CoE proposes in order to align with stakeholders expectations."
Both the Environmental Sustainability Steering Committee and EHS Council are comprised of top-level executives.
Each site is responsible for the management of its energy use.
"In many cases, we partner with our third-party Integrated Facility Management (IFM) providers to manage energy use and work toward achieving the corporate goals."
"In 2022, we conducted a climate policy alignment assessment of the trade associations listed in GRI 102-13 by determining whether they had publicly disclosed formal positions on climate change and, if so, reviewing those positions in the context of our Company's own position on climate change."

"While we implemented several projects that reduced our GHG emissions, we also experienced capital expansion, which resulted in a smaller drop in GHG emissions than last year."
"We have analyzed and reported our Scope 3 impacts using primary operating data, and accepted emission factors and an economic input- output model based on our third-party spend."
"In 2021, our Scope 3 GHG emissions increased as compared to 2020."
"While our business travel decreased sharply due to the pandemic and many employees were able to work from home offices, we continued our manufacturing and research operations, as well as continued the execution of many ongoing capital projects."
Our analysis shows that our Scope 3 GHG emissions impacts are nearly eight times greater than our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
"We are working to reduce those impacts through activities such as reducing waste in our operations, creating more sustainable packaging, and changing the way we commute to work and travel for business."
We are also engaging with our strategic suppliers to identify ways to reduce GHG emissions in our supply chain.
"These actions not only reduce our environmental impact, but also benefit the business byreducing costs."
We report our GHG emissions as required by regulations in certain countries and annually through CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project).
"In 2021, CDP graded our Climate Change disclosure as a B or a rating of management, indicating that we are taking coordinated action on climate issues."
"Additionally, we received an A- on our Supplier Engagement Rating (SER) score, which puts us on CDPs supplier engagement leaderboard."
"By receiving an A-, we are demonstrating our commitment to engaging with our suppliers onclimate change."
Our CDP Climate Change Questionnaire is available on CDP's website.
"GRI 305-6 Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) GRI 305-7 NOx, SOx and other emissions We are committed to controlling air emissions from our facilities to reduce local, regional and global environmental impacts."
"Air emissions are generated by our manufacturing and research operations, as well as by burning fuel in on-site equipment and fleet vehicles."
Our Air Management Standard requires our facilities to quantify and control air emissions to comply with both applicable regulations and emission standards.
Any increase in production can negatively impact our emissions trends.
"Though there are efforts to minimize solvent use in production, solvents are needed for cleaning and disinfecting purposes."
"As we transform from manufacturing of pharmaceuticals to biopharmaceuticals, mandatory cleaning and disinfection protocols associated with biologics and vaccines are increasing solvent-based emissions."
The Montreal Protocol mandates phase-out of refrigerants that are ozone-depleting substances (ODS) per schedules approved for individual countries.
Our facilities strive to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements that have been established in accordance with each countrys commitments.
"Our Air Center of Excellence (CoE) provides assistance as needed to our facilities to obtain appropriate environmental permits, and to quantify and control air emissions to comply with applicable regulations and emission standards."

Evaporation of solvents into the air is our primary source of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.
"In an effort to reduce VOC emissions, reduction in solvent usage has been incorporated as an element of our Green & Sustainable Science program (see GRI 301 on page 83 for more information)."
"Key elements of the program include designing efficient processes that use fewer and less-hazardous organic solvents, and using water- based methods for cleaning our process equipment where they are as effective as solvent-based methods."
"To reduce emissions from processes where organic solvents are used, we use pollution-control technologies such as conservation vents, carbon filters, thermal oxidizers, condensers and scrubbers."
"Fossil fuel combustion emissions Air emissions are also generated by burning fuel in our boilers and power-generation turbines (for heat and energy), and by other combustion processes such as thermal oxidizers (for treating air emissions) and incinerators (for destroying waste)."
Our fleet vehicles and aircraft also burn fuel and generate air emissions.
"CONTINUED: GRI 305-6 | GRI 305-7 These combustion processes result in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)."
We strive to make our facilities more energy efficient through our energy-management programs and to improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet vehicles.
"By making these improvements, we also reduce emissions of CO2, NOx, SOx and VOCs from our operations."
"The increase in SOx emissions from 2020 to 2021 can be attributed to more accurate emission-tracking methods, increase in combustion of diesel fuel at one of our facilities, and contribution from increase in usage of jets."
"The decrease in NOx emissions from 2020 to 2021 can be attributed to the reduced combustion of fuel due to variations in production, as well as our reduced use of emergency generators."
"VOC emissions decreased from 2020 to 2021 due to variations in production, as well as data collection improvements with the adoption of more accurate emission-tracking methods."
Emissions of ozone-depleting substances are the result of non-routine releases from temperature-control and fire-suppression systems and can vary from year to year.

Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 109 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Waste GRI 306 Management approach The proper management of waste from our facilities is important to the communities in which we operate and is a focus of our environmental permits and other regulatory requirements.
"Our waste management standard requires our facilities to comply with applicable generation, management and disposal regulations and standards."
"To minimize our environmental footprint and align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we look for opportunities to avoid the use of hazardous materials, to reuse or recycle materials and to prevent the generation of waste."
"When prevention, reuse and recycling are not practical or feasible, we apply controls and treatment technologies to prevent human health impacts and minimize environmental impacts."
Governance Waste management is overseen globally by our Waste and Dangerous Goods Center of Excellence (CoE).
Each site is responsible for the management of its waste.
"In many cases, we partner with our third-party Integrated Facility Management (IFM) partners to manage site waste and work toward realizing the waste goals."
"For information regarding our environmental management and governance, and processes used to collect and monitor waste-related data, please see GRI 307 on page 116."
Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 110 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices GRI 306-1Waste generation and significant waste-related impacts GRI 306-2 Management of significant waste-related impacts Operational waste The amount of waste we generate reflects the efficiency of our manufacturing processes.
Operational waste is primarily generated from the following activities: Manufacturing Packaging On-site wastewater treatment Research Waste minimization begins with the upfront evaluation of our product designs and manufacturing processes.
"Through our Green and Sustainable Science program (see GRI 301 on page 83), we design processes that use safer chemicals, consume less energy, use less water and other resources, and generate less waste."
"Our process development biologists, chemists and engineers have the expertise tocreate more sustainable ways to make our products."
"We continuously strive to reduce the amount of operational waste we generate and to maximize the use of environmentally beneficial disposal methods such as recycling, composting and waste-to-energy."
"To ensure our waste is managed in an environmentally responsible manner, we use only approved waste disposal facilities."
"Approved facilities demonstrate that they have the systems, technologies and practices to manage our waste streams responsibly and in compliance with all applicable requirements."
We routinely audit these facilities to verify the acceptability of their systems and practices.
Waste types are defined differently in various parts of the world.
"For this report, we have divided our operational waste into two categories: Hazardous waste: Highly regulated or high-risk waste streams that need to be neutralized, treated or destroyed to address a particular hazard such as toxicity, flammability, corrosivity, radioactivity, pharmaceutically active or infectious Non-hazardous waste: This includes all other operational waste The amount of construction project-related waste can vary significantly from year to year based on the number and size of projects."
"Therefore, our definition of operational waste does not include construction or demolition waste from construction projects."
"Over the past few years, a number of countries in Asia have enacted legislation restricting the acceptance of solid waste from other countries."
"Historically, a large percentage of recyclable waste collected in the U."
"S. has been shipped to Asia for recycling, so this change had and continues to have the potential to affect the percentage of our non-hazardous waste sent for recycling."
"However, this change had minimal impact on our recycling rates in the past year."
The percentage of our non-hazardous waste sent for recycling increased from 39 percent to 42 percent from 2020 to 2021.
"In 2021, we allocated approximately $100,000 to waste projects through the Sustainability Capital Fund."
"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 111 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Value chain waste Potential waste-related impacts are also associated with upstream activities such as external manufacturing of active ingredients, thepurchase of raw materials and goods, and the return of off-spec product."
"Similarly, the impacts downstream of the packaging and waste generated from the use of our products is estimated in our Scope 3 GHG emissions."
"For more information, please refer to section GRI 305 on page 104."
"While we may not be in full control of the waste generated in our value chain, we pursue various initiatives to reduce the impact, for instance, through our product and material choices."
"Some of these waste-reduction initiatives across our value chaininclude: Eliminating substances of concern from packaging Our Green Supplier program Solvent recovery and beneficial reuse Packaging design efficiency Re-usable shippers (in product distribution) According to our Business Partner Code of Conduct, partners shall operate in an environmentally responsible and efficient manner to minimize adverse impacts on the environment."
"Partners are encouraged to conserve natural resources, to avoid the use of hazardous materials where possible and to engage in activities that reuse and recycle."
"For more information on supplier engagement, please see GRI 308 on page 122.CONTINUED: GRI 306-1 | 306-2 Goal By 2025, no more than 20% of our global operational waste will be sent to landfills and incinerators (withoutenergy recovery)."

Our audit leaders are full-time professional EHS auditors with extensive experience in auditing a broad range of EHS programs.
The individual audit teams consist of EHS professionals with extensive site and subject-matter expertise.
"In many cases, particularly outside of the U."
"S., our internal auditors work with independent consultants who have regulatory expertise in the laws of the host country."
"All audit findings are addressed through the development of corrective and preventive action (CAPA) plans, which are reviewed, approved by the audit leader and regional EHS leader, and tracked to completion."
This process includes senior management oversight.
"Findings from our audit program are communicated to appropriate parts of the organization so that learnings may be shared and preventative actions can be taken, and audit performance and key program metrics are reviewed as part of our governance process."
"We use multiple factors to determine the audit frequency of our facilities, including facility size, operational complexity, compliance status and performance history."
"Our most complex operations are audited every year, and all manufacturing and research operations are audited at least every three years."
"Less complex facilities, such as sales and business offices, are audited less frequently."
"In 2021, weperformed 53 corporate EHS audits, involving 669 auditor days ofremote review and on-site activities."
"To support safety and environmental compliance on our capital projects, EHS audits of selected Global Engineering Solution (GES) projects were initiated in 2021."
"Three GES capital projects were audited in 2021, and four project audits are planned in 2022."
"According to the 10th Biennial EHS Audit Practices Survey by International Audit Practice Consortium (IAPC), approximately 25 percent of the companies surveyed include major capital/construction projects in the scope of their EHS audit programs."
"In 2021, the EHS audit process continued to be affected by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, with a remote audit methodology predominant."
"Remote audits were accomplished using technology tools such as video conferencing, use of electronic document repositories and both real-time and recorded videography, and 92percent of the remote audits were followed up with an on-site field review of the findingsidentified."
"A survey by the National Association for Environmental, Health & Safety and Sustainability Management (NAEM) found that remote EHS auditing has increased since the onset of the pandemic for the companies responding to the survey."
Most companies (68 percent) responded that they were currently piloting or conducting virtual audits in some capacity.
Regular internal Quality Assurance Reviews of the program are performed by our Corporate Audit and Assurance Services at least every three years.
"The most recent review of the EHS auditing program was performed in March 2021, and resulted in a rating of Effective with controls and practices deemed to be in line with our requirements and expectations."
"In addition to our corporate EHS audit program, our sites regularly perform self-inspections and review compliance with permit conditions, regulatory requirements and Company EHS Standards, with all programs being evaluated at least once every three years."
"Certification We are certified in the Responsible Care Management System Technical Specification RC101.06, 2019."
"The RCMS recertification occurred on December 4, 2019."
"Additionally, our corporate EHS management system is generally aligned with the requirements of the International Standards Organization (ISO), but we do not pursue certification under the Environmental (ISO 14001) or Safety (ISO 45001) frameworks at the global level."
Some of our facilities have individually achieved ISO 14001 certification to meet customer requirements.

"With research and manufacturing operations dating back more than 100 years, some of our facilities operated at a time when there were few regulations and little understanding of good environmental practices."
"Because we are responsible for remediation of these sites, we have launched investigations, developed science-based remediation plans and implemented cleanup projects to protect the health and safety of our neighbors, communities, employees and the environment, and comply with all applicable requirements."
"Over time, we have acquired properties and manufacturing facilities that may not have been subject to the same EHS management standards that we have in place today."
We are also investigating and remediating those properties where necessary.
Expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $12million in 2021 and are estimated to be $24 million in the aggregate for the years 2022 through 2026.
"In managements opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $40 million and$43 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively."
"Environmental data collection We measure and monitor environmental data for all global manufacturing and research sites, as well as large office buildings."
Allmetrics are entered quarterly by sites into an enterprise data collection and reporting software system as part of our internal Environmental Data Collection (EDC) process.
The data is reviewed at the corporate level on a quarterly basis to monitor sites progress and assist the sites as needed to support work toward our goals.

"In addition, we aim for EHS performance that is among the best in thepharmaceuticalindustry."
Our Company has processes in place that are consistent with the International Labour Office (ILO) Code of Practice on Recording and Notification of Occupational Accidents and Diseases (the Code) in countries that have adopted the Code.
"In countries that have not adopted the Code, we report to governments in a manner that is consistent with applicable law."
"For consistency across the Company, and to enable us to compare our injury rates with those of other multinational companies, we use the U."
S.-based OSHA recordkeeping criteria for recording and tracking work-related injuries and illnesses.
"We require all injuries, illnesses and incidents involving our employees to be reported and investigated to determine their cause."
We also require corrective and preventative actions be taken to prevent recurrence.
"We have reviewed the ISO 18001 Standard; however, we have not pursued certification because we believe that our current EHS management systems are robust and achieve our desired levels of EHS performance."
"GRI 403-1Occupational health and safety managementsystem Our Companys EHS management system includes comprehensive programs focused on reducing risks, work-related injuries/illnesses and other safety incidents from our operations."
"We focus on safe facility design, process controls, operation and maintenance procedures, protection systems and emergency-response capabilities."
Our EHS Management System supports a proactive EHS culture and our Companys objectives.
"We strive to achieve a strong EHS culture through visible leadership, active employee engagement and a focus on proactive identification and elimination of hazards."
An example of employee EHS engagement is our active Employee Safety Committees.
These Committees include workers and management and are designed to allow for a partnership to proactively address EHS issues.
"We address the following areas in our approach to employee and contractor safety, which are discussed in more detail in GRI 403-2 on page 132 and GRI 403-3 on page 136: Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation (403-2) Non-routine hazardous work (403-2) Capital projects construction safety (403-2) Safety for non-Company personnel (403-2) Motor-vehicle safety (403-2) Emergency response (403-2) Loss prevention (403-2) Industrial hygiene (403-3) Biological safety (403-3) Ergonomics (403-3) For information on our Global Safety and Environment (GSE) EHSManagement System, please visit GRI 307 on page 116."
"GRI 403-2Hazard identification, risk assessment, andincident investigation Our process safety program identifies controls and manages risks associated with the manufacturing and handling of our human and animal health products."
"The program applies to operations that are subject to process safety regulations and also to our pilot plants, manufacturing operations and utility areas where process hazards mayexist."
"In addition, we have implemented a structured chemical- reaction-hazard review program for our research laboratories."
"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 132 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices In the early stages of product development, we conduct chemical reaction and thermal testing of our intermediate materials and products to identify potential reactivity, fire and explosion hazards and environmental risks."
This testing continues throughout the life cycle of each product to assure that we are aware of the process risks of each material and can properly manage these risks.
Global process safety professionals work with operations and engineering personnel to conduct process hazard analyses to thoroughly evaluate our operations.
"These structured reviews take place duringthe initial process design, final process design, initial start-up and throughout the life of the process."
"This ensures our facility design, equipment, operating controls and maintenance procedures are effective in identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating process-related hazards."
"Non-routine hazardous work In recognition of industrial safety trends and our own internal assessments, we have refined our global approach to managing safety during non-routine maintenance and repair activities, as these work activities are a leading cause of serious and fatal injuries across industries."
"We have developed global safety standards to minimize the potential for serious incidents when our employees are working at heights, entering confined spaces and working on or near machinery, piping and electrical systems."
"This global effort is focused on creating a rigorous and safe approach to risk reduction when performing these nonroutine, high-hazard work activities."
"Capital projects construction safety We have a strong construction safety program with a focus on zero harm to people, property and the environment."
Our Global Engineering Solutions (GES) group oversees hundreds of contractors and thousands of skilled craftworkers on our construction projects worldwide.
"Safety is integrated into all stages of our construction projects, beginning with the concept and design phases, and is carried through to Detailed Design, Construction and Commissioning/Qualification."
"CONTINUED: GRI 403-2 Our construction safety program mandates pre-job planning, hazard assessments and daily safety checks."
"We also conduct peer reviews by bringing together in-house engineers, contractors, the EHS construction team and other partners to conduct thorough project safety evaluations and sharing of best practices."
"We completed 125 peer safety reviews in 2021, covering 95 percent of our active projects that were chosen for Peer Safety Reviews."
The construction industry continues to see a negative trend related to the availability of contractor and craft resources.
"The impacts of this trend require management of resource availability issues, varied levels of experience and safety competencies."
"GES continues to use a hyper-care program to ensure additional supervision and safety oversight of new contractors, high-risk work scope contractors and less-experienced contractors."
"GES also uses a rigorous, third-party prequalification program to evaluate, score and prequalify contractors and subcontractors."
"This tool allows the team to evaluate contractors safety programs, past safety performance, safety incident rates, experience modifier rate (EMR) and training verification of craft, and reviews any regulatory citations prior to allowing them to bid on any projects."
Safety for non-Company personnel All contractors working at our sites are required to follow a prequalification and EHS evaluation process.
"They are assigned an internal contractor liaison to monitor EHS compliance, perform EHS inspections and evaluations and ensure they follow their safety compliance plans."
Contractors are required to report and investigate all EHS incidents and near-miss events.
"They also work with site-based EHS contacts to identify and implement corrective and preventive actions, which are tracked to completion."
Integrated Facilities Management (IFM) partners are globally sourced companies that are responsible for performing various maintenance tasks at our sites.
"IFM partners are required to follow our Company's EHS standards and site EHS procedures, and to monitor compliance activities associated with their scope of services and meet safety- related performance objectives."
Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 133 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices IFM partners are managed through a central governance team.
"The governance process includes dedicated resources to measure, monitor and evaluate IFM partner EHS performance and adherence to Company EHS requirements on an ongoing basis."
"IFM partners proactively follow a continuous improvement process whereby each year, in addition to our Company requirements, specific targets are set up and monitored at the governance level."
Motor vehicle safety The aim of our motor vehicle safety program is to promote a strong safety culture for our employees who operate vehicles while conducting Company business.
"Our program is designed to reduce the frequency and severity of motor vehicle injuries and reduce the number of collisions, violations and vehicle-related incidents across our global network."
"We have implemented a global motor vehicle safety standard and adopted programs, such as predictive analytics assessments that allow us to develop employee-specific defensive driving action plans, to promote safe driving skills and behaviors to our sales and marketing employees who operate the majority of our business-use vehicles."
"Emergency response We prioritize the prevention of incidents through equipment and facility design, operational and maintenance procedures and employee training."
"However, in the event that unplanned incidents occur, we maintain emergency preparedness and response capabilities at our facilities."
"Emergency response programs help secure the safety and wellbeing of our employees and visitors, the protection of the environment and nearby communities, as well as protecting our physical assets."
"We also conduct pre-emergency planning for credible emergency scenarios such as process upsets, fires, spills, releases, severe weather and security-related incidents."
"Site-specific emergency-response procedures include incident reporting and management, personnel evacuation, medical response and incident response and control."
We routinely conduct emergency response drills and train employees in both job-and site-specific emergency-response duties.
"CONTINUED: GRI 403-2 Many of our manufacturing plants have on-site, trained emergency response teams and mobile fire and rescue apparatus that can respond to fires, medical emergencies, technical rescues and spills/releases."
"Most of our emergency response teams interact directly with their local community-based emergency responders and,in somecases, assist off-site when requested."
"Loss prevention We proactively assess and manage the risks associated with fires and natural catastrophes (i.e., hurricanes, floods, windstorms and earthquakes) through our Loss Prevention Program."
"This program focuses on eliminating or reducing the impact of potential loss events through: Facility and process designs Inspection, prevention and maintenance procedures Fire suppression, detection and specialized protection systems Emergency response and business continuity programs."
"We engage globally recognized, external loss-prevention engineering service providers to routinely inspect and review new designs and modifications of facilities."
"This helps us to maintain a high standard of loss prevention that corresponds to the level of operational risk, monetary value and supply-chain importance."
Industrial hygiene Our industrial hygiene program helps safeguard employee health throughout all stages of research and manufacturing.
"Ourprofessionals identify chemical, physical and biological hazards andassess exposures and control risks."
"Based on industry-leading bestpractices, we accomplish this through a hierarchy of controls."
"These include: Prevention Substitution Engineering Administrative Personal protective equipment (PPE) Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 134 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices For example, when designing new processes and facilities, we build safety into our designs organically by eliminating risks, substituting less hazardous processes or materials and installing effective engineering and operational controls."
We also confirm the ongoing effectiveness of these controls after installation through a robust monitoring program.
When addressing existing processes and facilities we use a similar approach.
"First, we seek to eliminate hazardous materials and processes."
"When not possible, we use less hazardous substitutes and then evaluate potential engineering controls to mitigate the remainingrisk."
"Where engineering controls are insufficient, or not feasible, we establish effective work practice controls including those that may require selected types of PPE."
"In 2021, over 13,000 data points were collected and used to evaluate risk or to confirm effectiveness of risk reduction investments, and 250 risk reduction actions were completed."
We have delivered nearly four million reusable cloth masks to our workers and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic.
These masks follow the performance criteria of the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International Standard Specifications for Barrier Face Coverings.
"Wearing reusable masks supports our mission to preserve surgical masks and respirators for health care workers who need them, and to reduce waste by minimizing daily discard of disposable masks."
"Biological safety Our biological safety program aims to protect our employees, customers, vendors, partners and neighboring communities by identifying, assessing and controlling biosafety and biosecurity risks associated with the research, development and manufacture of our vaccines and therapeutic proteins."

"We are incredibly proud of our employees' resilience during this time, which was reinforced by the legacy we have created of fostering a culture that embraces inclusion as a competitive advantage."
We have consistently leveraged technology over the past several years to engage a global workforce.
"This skill and ability to foster inclusion with employees whether they were working on site, remotely, in the field or across global time zones was particularly beneficial as we engaged in hybrid working due to thepandemic."
Global diversity and inclusion (GD&I) objectives Our ability to accomplish our objectives is linked to the GD&I Strategyour framework for sustainable competitive advantage.
"Through it, we align with our purpose to save and improve lives and our purpose to create an environment of belonging, engagement, equity and empowerment that compels a globally diverse and inclusive workforce which works to improve patient health."

Our commitment to GD&I is further reinforced by our CEO.
He advocates for diversity and inclusion as a strategic business imperative through the following commitments: Approving diversity metrics and reviewing progress against aspirational talent goals Driving accountability through meetings with our leaders and engaging employees in Companywide events to review key strategic initiatives centered on GD&I Conferring with our vice president of human resources and chief diversity officer on innovation opportunities and business solutions Pay equity We have had a longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion and fair and equitable pay for all employees.
"This commitment is consistent with our core values of integrity, fairness and treating all people with dignity and respect."
"Having the right culture, systems and practices for talent recruitment and development are critical in driving our ability to compete in global markets where talent is increasingly scarce and increasingly diverse."
"Diversity, equity and inclusion are among our ethical and strategic imperatives."
Pay equity is a critical principle at our Company.
We maintain a PayEquity Council that is deeply engaged in our pay equity initiatives.
"The Pay Equity Council is jointly led by our vice president of Diversity and Inclusion and senior vice president of Global Compensation, Benefits and HR Operations."
"Among its members are leaders within our Global Diversity & Inclusion (GD&I), Compensation and Benefits, and Employment Legal organizations."
Pay equity is a topic that is rightly receiving a great deal of attention and scrutiny.
"While many other organizations have only recently begun to explore how to pay their employees equitably, providing fair and equitable pay has been one of the pillars of our compensation philosophy."
"Our efforts toward pay equity include: Regularly monitoring and evaluating our pay practices and policies to ensure that we are paying our employees equitably across all genders, races and ethnicities Basing compensation for new hires on their skills, work experience and other job-related factorsCONTINUED: GRI 405 Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 149 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Training our managers on our diversity, equity and inclusion policies to ensure that decisions regarding employees, including those related to compensation, are based on legitimate job-related criteria and not personal characteristics such as gender, race or ethnicity We have also engaged external experts and legal partners to conduct annual pay equity studies in the U."
S. and abroad.
"As of 2021, we have conducted such analyses including approximately 75 percent of our global employee population."
These studies allow us to identify whether any adjustments to compensation would be sensible in order to ensure that we continue to pay our employees equitably and fairly.
"By the end of 2022, we expect our pay equity studies will achieve nearly global workforce coverage."
Our 2021 pay equity study for the U.
"S. showed that we have achieved greater than 99 percent pay equity for female and male employees, as well as for non-white (including Black, Hispanic and Asian employees) and white employees, in each case, in equivalent positions."
"Where appropriate, based on the determinations of our pay equity studies, we make base salary adjustments to support our progress toward sustained pay equity across gender, race and ethnicity."
We also review and update our compensation policies and practices to minimize the risk of future pay gaps.
"Our continuing focus on pay equity furthers our goal of being the employer of choice for workers of diverse backgrounds, and it supports our efforts to attract and retain the best talent and reward performance consistent with our Leadership Standards."
"These are clear business imperatives for our Company, and we remain firmly committed to them."
"Our external commitments to pay equity and gender equality include the following: Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index We were named to the 2021 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI), which recognizes companies committed to transparency in disclosing gender-related metrics and investment in workplace gender equality."
"Paradigm for Parity In 2018, we signed on to support Paradigm for Paritya call-to-action and model for gender equality."
"The goal of the coalition is to achieve full gender parity by 2030, with a near-term goal of women holding at least 30 percent of senior roles."
"Building upon this commitment, GD&Ipartnered with Paradigm for Parity in 2021 to launch the Profit and Loss Leadership Accelerator Program for Multicultural Women."
"The program recognizes that operational oversight of a company's profit and loss, commonly referred to as P&L, is a key benchmark for C-suite potential."
"However, just 31 percent of women say they have P&L experience compared to 71 percent of men according to research by Seramount."
"Of this 31 percent of women who have P&L experience, 74 percent are white and just 26 percent are women of color."
The Paradigm for Parity Profit and Loss Leadership Accelerator Program for Multicultural Women addresses this gap by providing women of color with operational financial management skills.
United Nations Womens Empowerment Principles We continue tracking our progress against the United Nations Womens Empowerment Principles.
These principles reflect seven areas of focus designed to promote gender equality in business.
Research from the World Economic Forum regularly updates the current rate of progress and estimates it will take over 200 years for women to achieve economic parity.
"According to McKinsey, the full economic participation of women in the workforce will generate $12 trillion to $28 trillion in GDP."
We have committed to gender equality as a strategy to drive business results and advance our purpose.
We continue to establish leadership programs to promote equality and publicly report on our progress to achieve gender equality.
"Leadership development We remain committed to equity across gender, race and ethnicity as a strategy to drive business results and advance our purpose."

CONTINUED: GRI 405 Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 151 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Building a more inclusive workplace and a culture of belonging Ensuring our employees feel a sense of belonging at our Company is a major priority.
We promote programs for managers that support inclusion and that our leaders use to share their perspectives.
Our Pulse surveys allow us to measure our employees' perceptions on inclusion and other critical workforce issues.
These surveys are just one of the avenues we use to directly engage employees and remain accountable to their needs.
It also allows us to be responsive to employee feedback on workforce issues and integrate their input into decision-making.
"We are proud of the fact that in the most recent survey, which occurred during the pandemic (and, in the case of the U."
"S., during a period of increased voluntary resignation known as the Great Resignation), 80 percent of our employees stated that they felt a sense of belonging at our Company."
"Related to our focus on inclusion is our commitment to a decade- long practice of understanding, measuring and acting to sustain high employee engagement."
"Like many companies, and following the social unrest and injustice witnessed in the U."
"S. and around the world, the practice of listening deeply to our employees was critical to our own decision-making and influenced leaders across the organization."
Many of our EBRGs were highly engaged in offering listening forums to colleagues to foster authentic and courageous conversations in an emotionally safe environment.
"Going forward, we publicly committed to maintaining or exceeding our current employee engagement index score through 2025 measured through Pulse surveys, which are conducted multiple times a year."
"Employee retention, recognition andmanager capability The past year reflects our ability to continually attract and retain highly qualified people, strengthen our competitiveness and mitigate employee turnover."
We have held ourselves accountable for increasing diverse representation and have displayed our representation information each year in our ESG Progress Report.
"Last year, we also shared our aspirational goals for improving diverse representation in senior management, including women and people of Black/African American and Latino/Hispanic descent."
We aim to create more opportunities for underrepresented groups by evaluating our hiring processes to determine where we can remove barriers.
"This includes training our managers on strategies to mitigate unconscious bias in the candidate selection, hiring and recognition process."
"In addition to enterprise-wide Unconscious Bias education, which was introduced to the organization in 2014, we have introduced programs to continue to drive our strategic focus and investment in building employee retention, recognition and manager capability."
Gender sensitive recruitment and retention Talent acquisition plays a pivotal role in sourcing and attracting diverse talent and in consulting with hiring managers to eliminate unconscious bias in the selection process.
"Using a gender decoder tool for job postings, biased language is highlighted with suggested alternative wording, helping to create gender neutral and inclusive job descriptions."
"Recognition programs for people of color in science The Merck Research Award for Underrepresented Chemists of Color recognizes graduate students and post-doctoral fellows for their chemical science research across a range of focuses, such as computational, analytical, medicinal, biological and synthetic chemistry."
"David Thaisrivongs, who is a director in chemistry based in Rahway, started this initiative when, after the social unrest in 2020, he noticed that there were not many chemists of color at our Company."
We developed a three-month program that attracted over 130 applicants and awarded 12 recipients.
The applicants must be third-year graduate students at a minimum or postdocs doing research in chemistry at a U.
S.-based institution.
Awardees were paired with a Merck mentor and networked with another winner.
INSPIRE Research indicates as much as 20-30 percent of all written communication includes some form of unconscious bias.
"As companies shift to a remote or hybrid work model, that poses significant risk to employee engagement."
"INSPIRE, developed in collaboration with Workhuman Technology, is one example of how we are building inclusion capabilities among managers by elevating their awareness of how unconscious bias can influence the selection of candidates who receive recognition."
This is a new feature added to our existing CONTINUED: GRI 405 Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 152 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices programs to leverage principles of inclusion to recognize and reward performance and promote retention of talent.

"D&I Learning Journey The new D&I Learning Journey, aligned with Global Learning & Development, acknowledges that everyone begins their learning journey at different levels."
"It recognizes that while effective, traditional classroom learning is only as impactful as the ability to leverage the learning in outside settingsin team meetings, in one-on-one conversations, in evaluations and reviews, etc."
The D&I Learning Journey identifies the core capabilities and behaviors required for success.
"The program, available globally at our Company, creates learning opportunities for individuals to pause, reflect and consider alternative responses to D&I-related questions to build inclusion capabilities and competence."
"It reinforces learning for every individual within the organization, embedding diversity and inclusion more deeply into everything we do."

"Economic inclusion and supplier diversity In 2021, diverse spend represented 12 percent of our total procurement spend, exceeding our corporate goal in spend with minority-owned, women-owned, veteran-owned, LGBT-owned and disability-owned business enterprises."
It is important to provide definitions and context for diverse suppliers.
"Diverse suppliers are businesses that are 51 percent managed, controlled and operated by a person or persons of the following categories: Minority: Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American Women LGBTQ+ Veteran, service-disabled veteran Disability-owned business Non-Diverse refers to those suppliers that dont qualify per the definition above."
"$2.9 billion spending with diverse suppliers globallyCONTINUED: GRI 405 Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 155 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices In addition to the amount of dollars we spend, we focus on the investment, impact, growth and development of our suppliers to address social determinants of health (SDOH), leading to health equity and value delivery in the communities where we live and work."
"The correlation between our Companys diverse supplier spend and SDOH was validated in 2021 through independent research conducted by Proximo Inc., an information technology services firm that specializes in data analytics and business intelligence, data warehousing and integration, and data strategy and governance."
Two unique data sets were integrated to conduct the research: 1.
"Spend data for 2020 was enriched to remove duplicate supplier listings, update incomplete addresses and identify the county foreach supplier 2."
"County Health Rankings & Roadmaps data for 2021 is inclusive of publicly available measures of health outcomes, health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment."
"This data was compiled to create an overall data- driven view of the health of nearly every county in all 50 states, excluding California1 and Puerto Rico.2 The findings of this study are significant, compelling and validate a correlation between our Companys spend and SDOH variables."
"The following key indicators of impact in the community where diverse suppliers are located were identified: household income, percentages of babies born with low birth weight, child mortality rates, percentages of adults with frequent mental distress, the food environment index and uninsured rates."
"Household income Increased spending with minority-owned supplierssuppliers that are at least 51 percent managed, controlled and operated by individuals from minority backgroundsleads to statistically significant increases for all households Increased spending with minority-owned suppliers generates disproportionately greater economic impact vs. increased spendingwith non-diverse suppliers among Black households (4.5x greater economic impact) and Latino households (2.8x greater economicimpact)Low birth weight Increased spending with minority-owned suppliers leads to statistically significant reductions in the percentage of Black babies born with low birth weight from 12.9 percent to 12.4 percent in the time this study was executed As a result of increased spending with minority-owned suppliers, Black and Asian child mortality rates show a statistically significant reduction of 12 infant lives saved per 100,000 births, and eight infant lives saved per 100,000 births, respectively Increased spending among Black- and Latino-owned suppliers leads to statistically significant reductions in both Black and Latino child mortality rates."
"Increased spending among Asian-owned suppliers leads to statistically significant reductions in Asian and Black child mortality rates Mental distress Increased spending with minority-owned suppliers leads to statistically significant reductions in the percentage of adults with frequent mental stress from 13.2 percent to 12.7 percent Food environment index Increased spending with minority-owned suppliers leads to statistically significant improvements in healthy food access from 8.3 percent to 8.7 percent Uninsured rates Increased spending with minority-owned suppliers leads to statistically significant reductions in the percentage of uninsured rates for children (4.0 percent to 3.8 percent) and for adults (11.9 percent to 9.0 percent) Our ongoing economic inclusion and supplier diversity efforts will enable us to continue our membership in the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR), an exclusive industry organization that recognizes and celebrates corporations that achieved spending at least $1 billion with diverse suppliers headquartered in the U."
S. and globally.
Our membership in the BDR allows us to share and access best practices in supply chain diversity excellence with other organizations that have also achieved this status.
CONTINUED: GRI 405 1 California was removed from the analysis due to severe housing problems which caused them to be an outlier in terms of nearly all SDOH variables.
"2 The 2021 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps data did not include data for Puerto Rico, so those suppliers could not be included in the study."

This grievance mechanism and associated reporting channels are fundamental to ensuring that employees and workers have access to an effective remedy whenever human rights impacts occur.
"We expect our suppliers to encourage all workers to report concerns or suspected illegal activities without threat of reprisal, intimidation or harassment, and to investigate and take corrective action if needed."
"Inaddition, we expect our suppliers to provide workers with information on how to confidentially report concerns and ensure that reporting workers are protected from retaliation."

We are committed to upholding the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) Principles and we require our suppliers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws.
We have a formal program led by our Global Supplier Management Group (GSMG) to evaluate the risks for labor and human rights (LHR) in our supply chain.
We have a Conflict Minerals due diligence program and complete the associated annual reporting.

"For information on our policies, please visit our Policies & Positions and ESG Resources pages of our corporate website."
Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 164 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Human rights and labor risks We recognize that companies with supply chains that extend into high-risk countries potentially face greater LHR risks.
"Our Company can be exposed to these risks through our supply chain, as some of our third party suppliers and service providers operate in higher-risk countries."
"To help manage and address potential risks associated with third party business relationships, GSMG has an established cross-functional, third party risk management committee and program."
LHR risks are considered as part of our third party risk management activities.
We also recognize that potential risks may exist beyond Tier 2 suppliers.
"During 2021, we worked to detect and address the risks in our supply chain by: Supplier selection: Selecting suppliers that are socially responsible and who share our commitments to ethics and integrity."
"We strive to obtain the services, goods, active ingredients, components, finished goods or other products in a way that is lawful and fair."
"Expectations: Setting and communicating our expectations of suppliers, including those related to child labor, forced labor and human trafficking."
We use our Business Partner Code of Conduct to communicate our expectations.
It has been translated for all countries in which we operate.
Supply chain mapping: Mapping our supply chain to identify which of our suppliers operate in countries that are known to present a significant risk of LHR issues.
We use this information to help us decide upon the level of due diligence that may be necessary.
"Due diligence: Conducting appropriate supplier due diligence to help determine the level of risk presented by suppliers, including potential new (prospective) suppliers as well as our existing suppliers."
"Our supplier due diligence process for LHR targets direct materials suppliers, including external manufacturing suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations, regardless of their geographic location."
"A self-assessment questionnaire is used to gather information on freely chosen employment, child labor, employment practices, employee disclosures, fair treatment, wages, benefits and working hours."
"Suppliers responses are used to judge whether that supplier has programs and/or procedures in place to address potential risks for labor and human rights, including modern slavery and humantrafficking."
The information gathered as part of due diligence is used to determine the acceptability of suppliers local practices.
Results are then applied by GSMG to inform our supplier selection andrisk management processes.
Contracts: Seeking written commitment from suppliers to respect the principles set forth in our Business Partner Code of Conduct through our contracts/agreements.
Our contract templates contain a Business Partner Code of Conduct compliance clause that includes provisions related to modern slavery.
"Auditing: Performing LHR audits at select supplier facilities to verify their conformance with our expectations (as stated in our Business Partner Code of Conduct), and working with them to address identified nonconformances."
We use independent third party audit firms to perform announced LHR audits at suppliers facilities.
"When preparing our audit schedule, we consider the industry risk, the category of materials supplied, the country in which the supplier operates and results of past due diligence."
Remedial actions: Tracking and reporting (to senior management) on the closure of remedial actions taken by suppliers to address identified non-conformances (gaps/concerns) revealed by supplier LHR auditing.
Monitoring: Assigning relationship managers from within GSMG to oversee and monitor the performance of key suppliers.
We continue to hold suppliers accountable for meeting their contractual obligations.
Governance: Using our Third Party Risk Committee to help govern and oversee the management of risks associated with third party relationships.
This committee is chaired by our senior vice president for Global Procurement.
"The role of our Third Party Risk Committee (and associated Third Party Risk Team) is to assist senior leadership byproviding independent and objective oversight, monitoring andreporting in relation to the risks presented by third parties."

Appropriate collaboration and information-sharing in order to raise public and stakeholder awareness of the issue and risks are a crucial focus of our Product Integrity program.
"Through active partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies, and with organizations focused on security, patient safety and public health, we provide effective advocacy on high-priority anti- counterfeiting policy initiatives."
"These collaborative efforts support the production of reports, whitepapers and data-circulation initiatives, as well as promote the intelligence sharing necessary to combat threats from counterfeitmedicines."
The Anti-counterfeiting performance table below details the number of new suspected and substantiated counterfeit events in 2021 and for the previous four years.
The data above reflects the current status of each event for all years presented as of March 2022.
"Throughout 2021, Global Security addressed 2,350 product integrity events in 89 countries, involving counterfeit, diversion, supply chain security, tampering, financial integrity and brand security (non- MSD, unapproved generic product)."
"Approximately 33 percent of these events have been proactively investigated by Global Security to identify new or emerging product integrity threats, or to further characterize and mitigate known threats."
"We enable meaningful enforcement actions as a key strategic priority, and in 2021 our product integrity activity led to 242 arrests and the seizure of more than 29,349 units of counterfeit or illicit versions of our products."
There were 57 prosecutions resulting from product integrity investigations in 2021.
Another crucial aspect of investigations is the forensic analysis of questionable products.
"This forensic testing is aimed at concluding whether a questionable product is counterfeit, diverted or otherwise illicit."
Counterfeit products are characterized in order to gain further intelligence and understanding of the counterfeiters and the threats to public health.
We also have forensic detection devices in the field to analyze and detect counterfeits in regions around the world.
"As counterfeiters improve their skills and techniques, our forensic scientists have pioneered the use of several analytical tools for the detection and characterization of counterfeit medicines and continue to explore new analytical tools that would increase their forensic testing capabilities."
Lab findings are shared with regulatory and/or law-enforcement agencies and may be used to support subsequent enforcement actions and legal proceedings.
There were 497 unique questioned samples received as evidence and prepared for forensic testing in relation to active events in 2021.
"As part of our proactive awareness program, throughout 2021 Global Security trained approximately 2,870 law-enforcement personnel in more than 50 countries regarding the patient safety risks associated with counterfeit and diverted medication."
"Global Security also launched an internal training program on the Counterfeit, Diversion and Tampering (CDT) reporting process in late 2017."
"To date, more than 67,000 employees and contractors have completed this training globally."

This adds an important layer to the security of our products and materials imported to the U.
S. Serializationadding a 2D barcode with a unique identification number on each package that goes to marketis one of the tools we are investing in to secure our supply chain and prevent or detect counterfeiting.
A serial number on individual packages may enable anyone along the supply chainfrom a distributor to a pharmacist to a patientto scan the code and verify it as a serial number corresponding to a genuine product of our Company.
Serialization can add a robust layer to our product security platform.
"When associated with a regulatory mandate that specifies effective implementation and reporting to a national database, this method of product tracking can become a more meaningful product security tool."
Many jurisdictions around the world are requiring serialization on pharmaceutical packages or are considering such mandates.
"Serialization is required today in China, Turkey, Argentina, South Korea, Nigeria, India, Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, the U."
"S., EU, United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Russia, and will soon be required in Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa and Pakistan."
"Each countrys regulations are different, making it very challenging for our packaging sites and distribution networks to meet these diverse and intricate requirements, with additional complexity as reporting requirements are phased in."
"We launched the Global Product Serialization Initiative in 2012, with the goal of meeting these varying requirements in a robust, standardized and effective way based upon GS-1 standards."
"Through these efforts, we are currently in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements related to serialization."
"We are also working with industry associations and regulatory authorities to better understand potential new requirements and to advocate for simple, standardized and common-sense regulations that can be effective at protecting against counterfeit medicines."

These multifactor authentication systems would be enabled by blockchain nodes and applications that allow for secure and immutable product tracing that could be accessed by all supply chain partners and end users.
"We are currently running several proof-of-concept and pilot studies involving these emerging technologies, as well as participating in active industry associations, such as PharmaLedger, to further develop and apply these digital solutions."
"Clinical trial site monitoring, design, conduct andoversight We have long been committed to sharing the results of our clinical trials, regardless of their outcome, in a timely manner."
"If a clinical trial of a marketed product is terminated early for safety reasons, we promptly disclose medically important information to regulatory authorities and the public, update the status on www.clinicaltrials.gov within 30 days and submit a manuscript to a journal (or post a summary online) within 12 months after the last patients last visit occurs."
"If the trial was terminated for efficacy reasons, the results will be disclosed within 12 months after the last patients last visit occurs."
"Summaries of terminated trials will provide information about patient disposition, safety and adverse experiences, as well as an explanation as to why the trial was terminated early."
We comply with all applicable laws and regulations associated with the registration of clinical trials in publicly accessible registries and subsequent posting of the results from these trials.
"We have put into place the processes necessary for compliance with the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the European Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, including those related to clinical trial registration and posting results."
"For those who analyze, report or publish the results of clinical trials, a clinical trial registry also provides information on trials in progress and the ability to track such trials over the course of development."
"Company-sponsored and -conducted clinical trials involving patients assigned treatment with investigational and marketed products are registered at trial initiation on www.clinicaltrials.gov, www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu and www.encepp.eu."
"In accordance with our public policy position statement, all investigational studies in human subjects are conducted in a manner consistent with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines for the protection of human subjects, including those issued by the International Council for Harmonisation: Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP)."
"However, individual country regulations and guidelines should remain the primary determinant of specific requirements for the conduct of medical research."
"We have a commitment, where appropriate, to the study of diverse patient populations, including underrepresented groups, women and children, in our clinical trials in all regions of the world."
"As a result, we strive to obtain information among diverse populations, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the safety and efficacy of our medicines and vaccines."
These efforts allow us to seek regulatory approvals throughout the world and thereby offer our medicines globally to patients who need them.
"In addition to complying with our Companys global standards, the conduct of our clinical trials adheres to the International Council for Harmonisation: Good Clinical Practice standards and to the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki."
"When appropriate, an internal standing Data-Monitoring Committee (DMC) of our research laboratories senior managers reviews unblinded data from ongoing trials in a pre-specified, scientifically acceptable manner."
The goals of the DMC are to protect the safety of trial participants and assess whether the risk/benefit profile is favorable.
"The DMCs recommendations are communicated internally to relevant scientists and can be distributed externally to clinical investigators, review boards or regulatory agencies, as appropriate."

"There are occasions when our Company, in consultation with regulatory authorities, may determine that it is important to communicate new or updated information promptly to health care providers involved in prescribing or dispensing a drug or in caring for patients who receive a drug."
"In these situations, we work with regulatory authorities to communicate this information to health careprofessionals in a timely manner so that they can inform patients through appropriate mechanisms."
Product label reviews The ongoing oversight and monitoring of our product labels are a major focus of our safety efforts.
Our label review teams monitor information on our products and work with our product Risk Management Safety Teams (RMST) to develop or update product labeling.
We regularly communicate relevant information to regulatory authorities worldwide.
Health literacy Health literacy is essential to our overall strategy.
"We incorporate health literacy into all aspects of a product's development and lifetime, from clinical testing to labeling and packaging to patient education."
"In 2020, we founded a worldwide community of practice for health literacy, with membership from eight different nations and various corporate divisions."
"Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 174 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices This community of practice was established to assist in identifying and organizing health literacy advocates with the goal of training and educating colleagues more broadly, both through formalized, concerted efforts and through incidental collaboration in the course of daily work."
"In the fourth quarter of 2021, the community of practice launched an internal health literacy dictionary with more than 1,000words, and established an internal health literacy portal for the exchange of materials and best practices."
We are dedicated to increasing people's health literacy in the U.
S. andaround the world.
"As part of this commitment, our health literacy team has developed a novel method to enhance the patient labeling process for new compounds."
"The purpose of this is to validate comprehension across all the different consumer categories, with a particular emphasis on those who have lower levels of health literacy."
"To date, 10 of our medicines have FDA-authorized patient labels that were produced with input from patients whose health literacy skills ranged from low to high."
Employees who create and assess patient labeling for novel compounds are required to undergo training in health literacy methods for patient labels beginning in 2021.

"We believe that our marketing, sales and advertising activities make an important contribution to medicine by informing our customers of treatment options based on the most recent scientific information and findings from rigorous clinical studies."
"Our sales and marketing practices are governed by applicable laws and regulations and industry codes of conduct, and by our own global Code of Conduct, our corporate policies and procedures, and our ethics and compliance program."
"Customer privacy GRI 418 Management approach Information about our Company, products and people is one of our most valuable assets."
"We are committed to ethical use, management and protection of information."
Our commitment applies not only to our Companys information but also to the information entrusted to us by others.
"Our tools, processes and procedures ensure that we appropriately collect, use and safeguard information throughout its life cycle to ensure integrity of information and to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure."
"We have developed and continue to improve upon a comprehensive, global, state of the art information security and cyber resiliency program to enable us to fulfill our purpose: inventing for life."
There is increased pressure for companies to adopt the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as the basis for their own privacy policies and programs.
We are well positioned in that we have based our global program on the GDPR.
"In addition, our privacy program is flexible and adaptable to be compliant to new laws and regulations that take effect in the jurisdictions where we conduct business."
"Examples include the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in California, the Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) in Virginia, the Privacy Act (ColPA) in Colorado, and major revisions to the Data Protection Acts in China, Ecuador, Japan and Saudi Arabia."
"In addition, there is increased regulatory scrutiny and interest in companies that seek to collect and monetize personal information without full transparency and permission from data subjects."
Regulators will continue to increase requirements in these areas and levy fines.
"Again, we believe that we are well positioned for these changes due to the deployment of a comprehensive closed-loop privacy program and our active engagement with regulators around the world."
CONTINUED: GRI 417-1 | SASB 270a.2 Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 175 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices The Global Privacy Office reports into our chief ethics and compliance officer who reports directly to our chief executive officer.
Oversight of the privacy program is conducted within the Privacy and Data Protection Board (PDPB).
This is a cross-functional board that connects to the Corporate Compliance Committee.
The PDPB meets quarterly.
We are increasingly reliant on third party partners and service providers to assist us in our global operations.
"Just as we need to pay close attention to privacy and data protection, so do the third parties that comprise our supply chain."
Our Company employs a robust third- party due diligence process to ensure that we only do business with reputable third parties who share our values and standards.
Our approach is one of accountability and transparency.
"The heart of this program is a leveraged, world-class Global Privacy Program that manifests itself throughout the world as a network of over 250 Privacy Stewards deployed around the globe."
Program maturity is measured through a combination of annual privacy self-assessments at the entity and organization level and by comprehensive privacy audits conducted by internal audit.
We also provide annual mandatory cybersecurity training to communicate and reinforce the guidelines in the Information Security Standards Handbook and our commitment to a strong cybersecurity culture.
We have established a systematic approach for ensuring employees can understand and comply with Company policies.
We developed a robust cybersecurity training and awareness program that frequently and consistently delivers both compulsory and voluntary learning opportunities designed to encourage employees to make security-aware decisions regarding our Companys information security risks.
"Topics include, but are not limited to, information protection, identity, email, browsing and mobile security."
"Employees are also expected to maintain an up to date record of their qualifications that detail relevant cybersecurity work experience, skills, certifications and internal, industry or vendor-provided training they receive."
"CONTINUED: GRI 418 Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022 176 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices Global privacy program Over the past 20 years, we have developed and continually improved a comprehensive global privacy program that promotes organizational accountability for privacy, data governance and data protection across our business and with our collaborative partners and suppliers."
"We were the first in the world to obtain regulatory approval in the EU for Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), based in part on our existing Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) certified program."
This achievement demonstrates that organizations can rely on common internal standards and processes to govern international data transfers across both the EU and APEC regions to simplify their ability to address the growing regulatory challenges in this area.
Our holistic approach to privacy has its origins in biomedical research ethics and the protection of participants in the research studies that we sponsor and conduct.
"We have adapted human subject research ethics standards for risk-benefit analysis, transparency, anonymization, coding and prior review to other activities and processes involving data about people."
"Global privacy program 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Number of concerns regarding privacy practices, breaches of privacy and losses of personal data that were substantiated1123 315 29225034263 Number of privacy breaches requiring notification by ourCompany to individuals or government authorities0 2 2 0 3 1 Privacy concerns reported here include all concerns about our privacy practices reported to our Companys Privacy Office and substantiated or verified."
"Verified concerns are investigated as part of our Incident Management Process, which includes a determination of whether regulatory or data subject notification is required."
"2 Change in reporting criteria to exclude non-privacy, quality related issues from the data."
3 Increased sensitivity of network traffic monitors contributed to increased number in 2020 and 2021.
GRI 418-1Substantiated complaints regarding breaches ofprivacy or losses of personal data We have a well-established process by which privacy incidents can be reported to the Global Privacy Office and be investigated.
The first step of this process is to verify the facts reported and to substantiate the concern.
"In 2021, we received 426 substantiated privacy concerns, which marks a 70 percent increase compared to the previous year."
This increase was mainly due to enhanced capabilities for monitoring and detection of sensitive data in motion (network traffic).
Three out of 426 incidents were deemed to be reportable to data protection authorities and/or data subjects.
