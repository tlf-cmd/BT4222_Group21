This advocacy stance complements our climate actions in collaboration with our two major bottling partners in Europe.
Recycling and Reuse of Plastic The role of government regulation in creating a circular economy for our packaging materials is essential to ensure that societies can move from a linear to a circular operating modelone where materials stay in the economy for reuse and recycling and out of the environment.
"To support governments in the evolution toward better recycling outcomes, we work with them as well as with trade associations to provide evidence of the safety and quality of recycled materials, which in turn leads to increased take-up of recycled materials."
"In 2021, a number of governments around the world established plastic packaging regulations similar to our World Without Waste strategy, helping address both the waste challenge and the climate challenge."
"The regions that established food/beverage grade acceptance standards for recycled plastic content use include Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Yemen."
The state of California also adopted new recyclability standards.
"We continue to play an active role in driving for progressive policies that help solve environmental challenges, whether that is direct engagement with regulators on recycled PET usage standards or policy advocacy directly or through trade associations."
"Additionally, several regions established minimum recycled content guidelines, including Chile, Ecuador, the European Union, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the United States (California, New Jersey and the state of Washington)."
Our World Without Waste goals aim for 50% recycled material in all our packages by 2030; regulatory guidelines can help create scale in the supply chain that helps with the economics of recycling and a circular economy.
"Along with increasing recycled content, plastic collection is essential to achieving a truly circular economy."
"In 2020, we added our voice to the Business Call for a UN Plastic Pollution Treaty calling for a legally binding United Nations treaty on plastic pollution."
"We also continued to work in partnership with WWF, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the Ocean Plastic Leadership Network to bring diverse stakeholders together to help shape a long-term treaty."

"We catalogued these locations based on the detailed mapping and results from an Enterprise Water Risk Assessment (EWRA) from the World Resources Institutes Aqueduct 3.0 tool and from Facility Water Vulnerability Assessments (FAWVA), our site-level, internal proprietary tool."
The categories are defined as: 1.
LEADERSHIP LOCATIONS: our highest priority system facility locations and their correlated watersheds that have the highest potential water-related risks.
Facilities are on a path toward 100% regenerative water use by 2030.
See next page for more on regenerative water use.
2.
ADVANCED EFFICIENCY LOCATIONS: system facility locations in a water-stressed2 context that will drive advanced water efficiency improvements in operations.
3.
CONTRIBUTING LOCATIONS: system facility locations in areas with potential low water-related risks yet will contribute to water security overall by meeting 100% compliance with global Coca-Cola Company water stewardship requirements.
We are mapping priority ingredient sourcing regions and watersheds according to highest exposure to water stress.
"We also began mapping priority communities based on local context to identify opportunities for action to strengthen communities access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and their resilience to climate change (e.g., floods and droughts)."
"By mapping and overlaying all three of these categories (operations, watersheds and communities), we will identify overlaps and interconnectivity across our action areas to develop a holistic, integrated and context-based approach."
"Our Water Security Strategy Our 2030 Water Security Strategy outlines a vision of increasing water security for our operations, watersheds and communities."
"Water security is defined as the availability of a sufficient quantity and quality of water, access to safe water services and effective governance of shared water resources."
It is underpinned by global goals and specific context- based targets that will enable us to measure our progress toward reaching this vision.

"Aliados is a multi- sector partnership platform bringing together actors from the public and private sectors and civil society, and will be managed by The Global Environment Technology Foundation (GETF)."
CASE STUDY Resilient Communities We implement a human rights-based approach to water and communities.
We recognize the connection between our social license to operate and adequate water infrastructure.
"Insufficient access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and poor water quality are key challenges faced in water-stressed communities."
"Population growth, climate change, political conflict and forced migration are further straining water infrastructure and supply."
"COVID-19 exacerbated stresses on water systems, highlighting the importance of WASH to enable communities to protect themselves from disease spread."
"Over the past decade, The Coca-Cola Company has established strong leadership in community water programs with the support of The Coca-Cola Foundation and many nonprofits, governments, customers and other partners."
"Together, we have delivered sustainable community water interventions ranging from improving access to WASH to institutional capacity building, benefiting more than 18.5 million people since 2010."
"In 2021, our WASH projects included: Installation of handwashing facilities and water connections for communities in the Philippines to help respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, benefiting over 200,000 people Access to drinking water for more than 130,000 people impacted by flooding and other natural disasters in China in 2021 Our 2030 Water Security Strategy builds on this work, seeking to improve access to water and sanitation and strengthen community resilience."
"Were focused on projects that will support and empower women and girls who, in many parts of the world, bear most of the responsibility for fetching water and running households."
"As outlined in the Risk Assessments and Prioritization section, we are identifying our priority operational, commercial and sourcing communities."
We are using a set of criteria from leading global institutions specializing in water and health.
We aim to support all our priority communities in addressing shared water challenges by identifying and implementing interventions focused on three primary action areas: 1.
"Improving access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 2."
Enabling adaptation to water-related climate change impacts 3.
Ensuring rapid recovery from crises.
These actions will contribute to the achievement of our 2030 Water Security Strategy targets: Support access to WASH initiatives in all our priority communities Promote access to WASH throughout our bottling system and priority suppliers.
WASH Programs Focus on Needs of Women and Girls Clean water is only one piece of the water resilience puzzle.
"To achieve the greatest health and economic benefits, improvements in sanitation and hygiene must be prioritized alongside access to clean water."
We recognize our business operates in areas with significant challenges to water access and sanitation.
"This is one reason why sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygieneparticularly for women and girlsis specifically addressed in our 2030 strategy."
Were collaborating with international organizations and coalitions such as WaterAid and Global Water Challenge to understand and meet the needs of women and girls and to systemically embed and measure gender-related outcomes of community WASH programs.
This work will build on the groundbreaking findings of the 2018 Ripple Effect Study which quantified the significant impact of WASH improvements on womens empowerment and draw on learnings from the successful Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN) and our 5by20 economic empowerment initiative.
"In communities where water is scarce, women and girls are responsible for the grueling task of collecting water, resulting in missed opportunities for learning, generating income and pursuing a brighter future."
"Were proud to work with The Coca-Cola Company to drive change through the power of clean water and to involve women every step of the way to ensure inclusive, long-term solutions to the worlds most pressing problems."
"Kelly Parsons CEO, WaterAid AmericaSince 2010, our RAIN initiative has reached more than 6.7 million people in 41 countries and territories in Africa with safe, sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygiene, impacting more than 4,000 communities."
Pillar 2 Our Communities Executive Summary The Coca-Cola Company 2021 Business & ESG Report 25CEO Message Agriculture Portfolio Data Appendix Our Company People Packaging Frameworks Operations Climate Water Assessing Watershed Health in California A pilot project in the highly water-stressed state of California is just one example of the focus on watershed health in our strategy.
Our North American operating unit is partnering with The Nature Conservancy and other nonprofits to establish a watershed health plan for three vulnerable California watersheds that supply water to our system bottling plants and for our agricultural ingredients (particularly almonds and lemons).
"We developed watershed health scorecards, highlighting the greatest challenges and risks in the prioritized watersheds."
"The pilot project developed corresponding Watershed Stewardship Plans that identify actions to help improve watershed health and water security for our operations, ingredient sourcing areas and communities."
"This includes projects such as meadow and forest restoration, invasive species removal, fire management and prevention, and water-use efficiency."
These plans will also help us to track improvements in watershed health and co-benefits of projects (e.g.
enhanced biodiversity and carbon sequestration).
CASE STUDY Our Water Footprint Improved agricultural management practices can promote watershed health.
Water use within our agriculture supply chain accounts for 92% of our blue water1 footprint.
(See the Sustainable Agriculture section for more detail on our work on sustainable sourcing.)
Our work to identify priority watersheds and communities includes an assessment of water risks for watersheds where our global priority ingredients are grown.
"Healthy Watersheds Watersheds supply water for drinking, agriculture and manufacturing, provide habitat for plants and animals, and offer opportunities for recreation."
"While watershed protection has been a core element of our work for more than a decade, our new strategy places much greater emphasis on the holistic improvement of watershed health."
"As outlined earlier in this section, in 2020, we began analyzing and prioritizing our operational, commercial and ingredient sourcing watersheds."
"Over the past year, we have developed a Watershed Health Framework to provide our operations with help to assess watersheds' challenges and risks, and implement context-based Watershed Stewardship Plans."
Watershed risks vary from location to location.
"For some, water availability may be the primary risk; for others, it might be water quality, water access, soil health or forest fires, to name a few."
"By adopting a context-based approach, we aim to support interventions relevant to our priority watersheds."
This work at the local watershed level will contribute to the achievement of our 2030 high level targets: Implement watershed stewardship plans in all of our priority watersheds.
Promote advanced water management practices for our global priority ingredients grown in water- stressed regions.

The Importance of Nature-Based Solutions Infrastructure and construction can help protect vulnerable water systems.
But nature itself often offers the best mechanisms for restoring watershed health.
"We invest in nature-based solutions (NBS), which build on natural processes to manage water systems."
"To achieve our 2030 vision, we will lean even more heavily into nature-based solutions, such as forest protection and floodplain management."
"These types of solutions can provide a wide range of benefits, such as better water quality, carbon sequestration and enhanced biodiversity."
"Other direct and indirect benefits include water resource improvements, socioeconomic and public health benefits and climate change mitigation."
"In 2020 and 2021, we worked to identify and quantify the co-benefits of some of our replenishment projects to help us determine where to support future investments."
"In Europe, we partnered with denkstatt, an organization that advises businesses on natural and social capital, to develop a methodology to help us quantify the co-benefits of NBS projects."
"We also worked with The Nature Conservancy to pilot the CEO Water Mandate NBS Tool across more than 10 projects globally to better understand the links between various types of replenishment projects and nature-based solutions, helping to strengthen the business case for investment in these projects."

"Madhu Rajesh Senior DirectorWater & Agriculture, The Coca-Cola Company For more than a decade, The Coca-Cola Company has partnered with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Fundacion Defensores de la Naturaleza on an integrated watershed management project that addresses the interconnected issues of climate, water and agriculture."
The cloud forest of the Sierra de las Minas mountains of Eastern Guatemala serves as the primary source of water for thousands of people who live and work in communities that are located in the Pasabien and Teculutan watersheds.
"The rivers that flow down the mountainside once provided a plentiful supply of water for human consumption, agriculture and business."
"However, deforestation, intensive agriculture and human encroachment into the areacombined with a changing climatedegraded the natural ecosystem of these watersheds."
"This led to droughts, forest fires, polluted water sources and crop failure, with dire consequences for both nature and people: loss of biodiversity, respiratory problems from smoke and increased competition for scarce resources."
"In response, more than a decade ago, WWF and the Fundacion Defensores de la Naturaleza launched an integrated watershed management project that simultaneously addressed the interconnected issues of climate, water and agriculture."
The Coca-Cola Company was among the first to sign on as a partner and joined the project in 2007now one of many WWF projects we are proud to support around the world.
"In the Teculutan and Pasabien watersheds, The Coca-Cola Company provided funding and partnered with WWF for technical expertise while our local bottling partner, ABASA, signed a conservation agreement to help protect 500 hectares of forests through fire prevention activities and controlled burning."
"WWF also engaged local communities, farmers and businesses on the importance of forest preservation and supported farmers to use sustainable agriculture practices, such as improved crop irrigation, to reduce water use and agricultural run-off."
"In addition, the project provided local people with energy efficient cook stoves to help reduce the demand for charcoal required for cooking."
"And local businesses, including our bottling partner, were encouraged to reduce their water use and improve their treatment of wastewater."
"These activities have helped to reduce deforestation and land clearing for agriculture use, decrease forest fire frequency by 46% (comparing 2020 to 2015), reduce agricultural run-off by over 30,000 tons per year, improve farmer incomes and replenish 400 million liters of water annually."
The Coca-Cola Company has been one of our pilot partners when it comes to investing in the right way and the right solutions.
"We have three core concepts of resilience: not harming nature, using nature to help people, and helping nature adapt."
Coca-Cola has been great working with us toward implementing these very important principles in Guatemala.

"A World Without Waste, where materials are reused and recycled as part of a circular economy, is a world with dramatically lower carbon emissions and climate impacts, which is why our packaging and climate strategies are intertwined."
"Because packaging accounts for up to 30% of our overall carbon footprint, our World Without Waste efforts are essential to meeting our science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and our vision to be net zero carbon."
"Were reducing our carbon footprint by lightweighting our packaging, incorporating more recycled and renewable material, investing in local recycling programs and increasing our use of reusable packaging."
We continue to rethink our beverage packaging to become more sustainable.
"Most recently, we announced a global, and industry-leading, reusable packaging goal."
"In North America, we eliminated more than 60,000 metric tons of virgin PET from our packaging mix in 2021 by increasing our usage of recycled PET plastic (rPET) to 12% of our portfolio and through regional and national launches of 100% rPET3 packaging on select brands."
"In Europe, we eliminated more than 130,000 metric tons of virgin PET from our packaging mix in 2021 by increasing our usage of recycled rPET to 31% of our portfolio."
We now offer beverages in 100% rPET bottles (excluding caps and labels) in approximately 30 markets.
"In 2021, Coca-Cola Japan introduced 100% recycled PET bottles for two brands: Coca-Cola and Georgia - and 40% of the PET plastic used in Japan in 2021 was either from recycled or renewable material."
"In countries accounting for approximately 25% of our global PET use, rPET cannot currently be used in food- grade material."
We continue to work with industry peers to advocate for government regulations permitting the use of rPET in food and beverage packaging.
"Over the last several years, countries as diverse as Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and South Korea have adopted standards for food- and beverage-grade rPET usage."

"Even as we achieved our 2020 drink in your hand goal to reduce our relative carbon emissions by 25% against a 2010 baseline, we increased our climate ambition."
"Governance on Climate Change The ESG and Public Policy Committee, established by our Board of Directors, bears the highest level of direct responsibility for climate-related issues."
"The committee assists the Board in overseeing the companys environmental, social, legislative, regulatory and public policy matters, including progress against our science- based target."
"The committee reports regularly to the full Board on matters it oversees, including climate-related issues."
"To learn more about our ESG governance structure, see the Governance section."
"For more on climate-related governance, see our most recent CDP Climate Change response, Section C1."
"Embedding Climate Action into Our Strategy Building on our first climate risk scenario analysis in 2019, we undertook a far-reaching new study across our company and agricultural supply chain in 2021, looking at three scenarios: Business As Usual1 (warming above 5C), Middle of the Road2 (warming limited to 2.7C) and Low Carbon3 (warming kept below 2C)."
This process enabled us to identify a refined set of climate-related risks and opportunitiesincluding both physical and transition impactsin a range of possible futures.
This will be a critical tool for strategic planning and implementing resilience plans.
We will further analyze the risks and opportunities identified to ensure we have appropriate risk-management strategies in place.
We will disclose details in our forthcoming CDP Climate Change response.
"Managing Climate Risk We have established a cross-functional and cross- company Enterprise Risk Management process and Risk Steering Committee to oversee regular system-wide risk assessments, and we work to integrate climate risk planning into this process."
"Relevant risks that could materially affect our business, including our financial results, are disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K."
"These include risks relating to climate change, such as physical risks from changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters which may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities."
"Climate change may also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the Coca-Cola systems bottling operations."
"Increasing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements, among others."
Weve announced both our science-based target to reduce our absolute emissions by 25% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline and an ambition to be net zero carbon by 2050.
"Several of our bottling partners have announced their own science-based targets and net zero pledges, which will help drive even more positive climate action across the Coca-Cola system."
"In line with our net zero ambition, we conducted preliminary modeling in 2021 that will enable us to define the key actions and goals needed for a net zero transition by 2050."
"A significant amount of our impact is in our supply chain, so we encourage suppliersrepresenting approximately 80% of spend across most major procurement categoriesto respond to the CDP Supply Chain Climate Change questionnaire."
In 2021 we saw a threefold increase in the number of supplier responses compared to the previous year.
We believe that continued progress against our goals in combination with supporting key stakeholders as they strengthen their own ambitionswill be critical to making meaningful advances on climate.
We have also undertaken additional climate scenario risk analysis to better understand the potential near- and longer-term impacts of a changing climate on our business.

"Executive Summary The Coca-Cola Company 2021 Business & ESG Report 40CEO Message Agriculture Portfolio Data Appendix Our Company People Packaging Frameworks Water Operations Climate Supplier Reporting on Emissions & Reduction Plans Many of our agricultural suppliers report annually on their performance and progress in reducing emissions, which constitute 20-25% of our total value chain emissions, and on plans to achieve further reductions."
"Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) include maximizing energy efficiency and use of renewable energy, employing responsible forest management practices that protect biodiversity and restore degraded ecosystems, and maintaining or improving soils by preventing degradationall of which are important in mitigating climate impacts."
"To find out more, see Sustainable Agriculture."
Investments in Renewable Energy for Manufacturing Approximately 10-15% of our emissions come from manufacturing.
"Renewable energy use as a percentage of total electricity for the system was 12% in 2021.1 In February 2022, we released a Renewable Energy Implementation Guidebook, a step-by-step guide for company- owned facilities and bottling partners to build knowledge and increase facilities generation and procurement of renewable energy."
We also conducted analyses of renewable energy opportunities in six countries where implementation is more complex to support our teams in identifying renewable energy procurement options.
"In 2022, we will continue to support operating units and bottling partners to further scale their use of renewable energy."
"In 2021, we also re-joined the Clean Energy Buyers Association (formerly known as the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance) and are leveraging their resources and networks as we scale up our use of renewable energy."
More HFC-Free & Intelligent Connected Coolers Cold drink equipment and dispensing accounts for approximately one-third of our emissions.
"We are working to place more hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free coolers, replace older equipment with newer and more energy efficient coolers, as well as place more intelligent connected coolers that transmit data such as product throughput, maintenance status, temperature and energy use, which can improve our placement and management of coolers while reducing emissions."
"Innovations in Packaging Design & Increasing Collection Rates Because packaging accounts for almost one-third of our overall carbon footprint, virtually everything we do toward our World Without Waste initiative also helps to achieve our science-based target."
"This strategy includes more plant-based packaging that requires less petroleum-based virgin plastic; lightweighting our packaging; using more reusable packaging (both traditional refillables as well as fountain and Coca-Cola Freestyle dispensed solutions), using more recycled material; and recycling more bottles and cans."
"For more about our packaging efforts, see World Without Waste."
"Transitioning to a Low-Carbon Economy Achieving our science-based target means looking at our full value chain, including bottling partners and suppliers."
"Our target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 includes system partners within our scope 1 and 2 boundary."
Following are examples of how we are integrating our climate initiatives across our value chain and in collaboration with system partners.
"1 Due to an improvement in our data collection process and rigorous assessment of renewable energy claims throughout the system, this resulted in a drop in renewable energy use as a percentage of total electricity for the system from 17% to 12%."
"Executive Summary The Coca-Cola Company 2021 Business & ESG Report 41CEO Message Agriculture Portfolio Data Appendix Our Company People Packaging Frameworks Water Operations Climate fairlife Facility Reduces GHG Emissions As part of its ongoing commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, the fairlife facility in Coopersville, Michigan, partnered in 2021 with Generate, a company that builds, finances, owns and operates sustainable infrastructure such as energy, mobility and waste assets."
"In the partnership, fairlife sends the liquid waste and organic matter waste produced during manufacturing at the facility to Generates anaerobic digester about 30 miles away in Fremont."
"The waste is broken down in the digester, and the resulting biogas that is produced is used to generate electricity."
"While there are CO2 emissions associated with this approach, the net GHG emissions are much lower than if the organic waste had been sent to landfill where it would contribute to methane emissions, which have a warming potential 28-34 times that of CO2.1 Between November 2021 and February 2022, the Coopersville plant has diverted 753 tons of organic waste, preventing the release of 461 tons of greenhouse gases."
"This has produced over 1 million kWh of electricity and more than 175,000 gallons of organic fertilizer."
"Supplier Engagement Is Key to Transition Because approximately 85% of our total carbon emissions come from things we buy, and not what we do in our direct operations, engaging with suppliers is critical to achieving our science-based target."
"Our recent efforts include: Each year we encourage key suppliers to disclose to CDPs supply chain Climate Change questionnaire, which provides us with useful data on the GHG emissions in our supply chain and information on supplier targets and initiatives to reduce their emissions."
"In 2021, we requested 442 suppliers (up from 149 in 2020) to disclose, and 75% of these suppliers responded."
We are proud to have been recognized by CDP as a 2021 Supplier Engagement leader for the third year in a row.
This is an acknowledgement of our efforts to measure and reduce climate risks within our supply chain.
We join the top 8% of companies who disclosed to CDP's full Climate Change questionnaire.
We have piloted a questionnaire with 12 of our major suppliers across ingredients and packaging to begin moving toward supplier-specific emissions factors for the commodities we procure.
This allows us to better understand our supply chain and more accurately track the emissions reductions of specific suppliers in key areas of our supply chain.

"Brands to mobilize collective climate action by providing suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge to support their climate journey."
"Climate Resilience We are witnessing the impacts of changing weather patterns, which is why investing in the resilience of our supply chain and the communities where we operate is critical to our long-term success."
"Our work on resilience helps ensure we can withstand, recover from and adapt to the shocks and stressors of a changing climate."
Many of our climate resilience efforts relate to our ingredient supply chain and water stewardship.
"For more information, see our Sustainable Agriculture and Water sections, as well as our featured story about resilience in action."
We are also sharing the outputs of our work on climate resilience with peer companies.
"As founding members of the BSR Climate Risk to Resilience platform, we helped shape the development of resilience metrics and risk planning tools as well as the report Rising to Resilience (produced in collaboration with WWF and published in November 2020)."
This report provides practical application for businesses on how to integrate climate resilience into their water stewardship strategies.
Tracking Progress Toward Ambitious Climate Targets Accurately measuring our impact and tracking reductions is essential to achieving our climate goal.
Weve recently implemented a new data system for collecting sustainability metrics and continually work toward ensuring that our practices are industry-leading.
"In 2021, we took significant steps to help facilitate complete and accurate progress reporting against our science-based target."
We updated our GHG emissions accounting methodology for the Coca-Cola system aligned with the GHG Protocol and undertook an assessment to evaluate and expand the emissions sources included within our reporting boundary to align with requirements of the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).
"In 2022, we plan to track our target progress in real-time across the system, putting us in a strong position to publicly report on progress against our target next year."
"Coca-Cola System Climate Targets Across our system, many of our bottling and supplier partners have set their own science-based targets or have goals for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner."
"In December 2021, the Coca-Cola system in Europe announced a goal to reach net zero by 2040 across all European markets, covering the entire European value chain, building on net zero and science-based targets set by The Coca-Cola Companys two leading bottling partners in Europe, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners and Coca-Cola HBC."
This effort seeks a reduction of 2.5 million tons of CO2 equivalent annually in Europe by 2030 compared to 2015a reduction of 30%.
"Complementing these net zero commitments, several of our other bottling partners have also announced their own science-based targets, including Swire Coca-Cola Limited (Asia) and Coca-Cola FEMSA (Mexico)."
Additional details on Coca-Cola system emissions can be found in the Data Appendix.
"Going Solar in the United Kingdom Coca-Cola Europacific Partners completed Phase 1 of a three-phase solar development project at their facility in Wakefield, UK, the largest soft drinks plant in Europe."
"The early results are promising, already saving 340,000 in 2021 with installation of an 8.2 megawatt solar system that accounts for almost 20% of the facilitys electricity consumption."
"By the completion of Phase 3, we expect that the project will generate an additional 30 megawatts in solar energy and include up to 40 megawatts of battery storage capacity, ultimately transitioning the facility to be carbon neutral by 2050.CASE STUDY 1 The Challenge | UNECE."
Executive Summary The Coca-Cola Company 2021 Business & ESG Report CEO Message Portfolio Data Appendix Our Company People Packaging Frameworks Water Operations Climate Agriculture Sustainable Agriculture We rely on agricultural ingredients to make and package our beverages.
"Ensuring these ingredients are sustainably sourced is a key priority for us, and is essential to our efforts on climate resilience, water security, human rights, sustainable packaging and economic empowerment."
"As climate change leads to more extreme weather and increased water stress, more sustainable agricultural practices will play a vital role in promoting resilience across our supply chain and in the communities that produce our agricultural ingredients."

Our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) advance and standardize our core values at the farm levelfrom small-scale farmer cooperatives to large commercial operationssupporting livelihoods and helping to ensure continuity of supply.
"Introduced in 2021 to improve upon our previous sustainable agriculture framework, the PSA aim to strengthen our progress toward sustainable sourcing of agricultural ingredients, taking a longer-term perspective that reflects our expanding portfolio, increasingly diverse supply chains and the most recent science."
"The principles are designed to help farms become more productive, resilient, transparent and compliant."
"Working with our suppliers, we seek to advance on-farm practices and thereby create long-term, systemic change in our supply chains."
"More sustainable farming practices lead to improved farm incomes, through higher crop yields, better management, reduced costs and increased resilience to changing weather patternsas well as enhanced product quality and a more stable supply."
The PSA are designed to encourage continuous improvement of farming practices.
"Recognizing the diversity of supply chains, farm structures and risk contexts, the PSA introduced a new framework for evaluating compliance and performance of our supply farm base to reflect the on-the-ground realities in sustainable farming practices."
"The PSAs Leader/Mover/Improver framework helps us to catalog our ingredient supply into three performance categories so we can prioritize our actions in line with our companys highest sustainability priorities, including climate change, water resources, ecosystems and biodiversity, human rights, and animal health and welfare."
"These categories are: LEADER LEVEL, which means that the supply volume is verified to a TCCC approved, third-party validation aligned with the PSA.1 MOVER LEVEL, which means that the supply volume is sourced from farms using other agricultural farming standard(s), effectively identifying and addressing key sustainability issues and advancing sustainable practices."
"IMPROVER LEVEL, which applies when the supply volume is sourced from smallholder/small-scale producers participating in a support program and continuously improving practices to address their priority sustainability issues over time."
We are currently in the process of mapping the volume of the 12 global priority ingredients we procure against this framework.
This mapping will form the basis for how we engage with suppliers to drive continuous improvement in line with our Leader-Mover-Improver framework.
"Our long-term ambition is two-fold: All of our agricultural-based suppliers will demonstrate continuous improvement and will be categorized by The Coca-Cola Company as either Leaders, Movers or Improvers."
"All of our global priority ingredient suppliers and their farm supply base will achieve Leader status over time.1 These approved standards, which can be found on our website , currently include Bonsucro for sugar; the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative PlatformFarm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) for crops including cane sugar, beet sugar and fruit; the Round Table for Responsible Soy for soybean; the Rainforest Alliance for coffee and tea; the Forest Stewardship Council for pulp and paper; and Field to Market for U."
"S. corn, among others."
Certain third-party validation programs under the Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP)our previous framework that was in effect from 2013 to 2020are still in the process of being evaluated for use under the PSA.
"Once this benchmarking process has been completed, the list of approved verifications will be updated."

"Leader Florida Orange Growers Achieve Leader Performance Level We source a significant volume of oranges from Floridabut in 2020, none of our supply had been verified by an approved sustainable agriculture program."
We approached the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and asked for their support to engage Florida orange growers on the topic of sustainability.
"The resulting project, known as the Florida Orange Sustainability FSA Accelerator, brought together 14 companies aligned around the same goal: to increase the volume of sustainable oranges grown in Florida."
"Together, the SAI Platform created consensus across the orange-processing industry, supporting growers in implementing more sustainable practices and communicating the sustainable practices they were already employing."
"Our volume of sustainably sourced Florida oranges jumped significantly, from 0% in 2020 to 41% in 2021, and we expect the percentage to continue to grow."
"CASE STUDY Improver Smallholder Farmers Improve Practices in India In India, the majority of farmers are smallholders who often lack the ability to verify their production against global standards."
"We have been driving several initiatives to help small- scale sugar cane and fruit farmers improve productivity, increase profitability and become more resilient."
The sustainable agriculture project Meetha Sona Unnati began in 2016 with investments in sugar cane farmers in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
"It proved so successful that, together with our partners, we expanded it to the state of Karnataka."
"Under the flagship program Fruit Circular Economy we have extended these projects for growers of mangoes, oranges, apples, lychee and grapesall crops that are important to our beverage production."
"To date, these programs have trained a combined total of more than 150,000 farmers in sustainable agricultural practices, including ultra-high-density plantation and drip irrigation."
"CASE STUDYExecutive Summary The Coca-Cola Company 2021 Business & ESG Report 44CEO Message Portfolio Data Appendix Our Company People Packaging Frameworks Water Operations Climate Agriculture Progress Toward Our Goal We track progress against our sustainable sourcing goal for 12 global priority ingredients (cane sugar, mango, grape, orange, apple, corn, lemon, beet sugar, tea, pulp & paper, coffee and soybean), which represent about 80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases."
"In 2021, following the launch of our PSA, we benchmarked over 500 suppliers in more than 115 countries and territories to begin mapping our global priority ingredient volumes against this new framework and establish a baseline."
"58% of our priority ingredient volumes were sourced sustainably from suppliers using third-party validation programs already approved under the PSA, effective 2021."
"This means they met the ""Leader"" level in our PSA framework."
We have made significant progress with our suppliers to validate or verify the farms where our ingredients are grown.
"We recognize, however, that sustainable agriculture is not a fixed destination but a long-term process that requires ongoing engagement between our business and our supply chains."
"Planting Cover Crops Improves Soil Health in Indiana In 2016 and 2017, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and The Coca-Cola Company partnered with producers in the Big Pine Creek watershed in Indiana to establish cover crops on 2,660 acres of farmland.1 Producers planted a cereal rye cover crop outside the growing season of the main crops of corn and soybean, which are planted in rotation."
"When planted over several years, cover crops improve the overall health and water- holding capacity of soils,2 sequester carbon and reduce soil erosion and runoff.3 Following this initial investment and support, many farmers have continued to plant cover crops each year using their own funds."
"In 2021, out of the original 2,660 acres that were supported, a total of 1,264 acres of cover crops were planted.1 The total estimated decrease in runoff associated with the planting of these cover crops is 484 million liters per year.4 The decrease in sediment erosion is estimated at 2,001 metric tons per year.4CASE STUDYImprover Fruto Resiliente in Brazil Smallholder farmers often face major challenges in having their production validated by a third party."
"So in 2019, we launched the Fruto Resiliente project with a goal of improving the farming practices of 480 smallholder orange growers in the Brazilian citrus belt by the end of 2023, with at least 50% of them reaching the equivalent of bronze level of the SAI FSA standard."
"The project is a collaborative partnership between The Coca-Cola Company, The Coca-Cola Foundation, innocent, Solidaridad, Cutrale (our largest orange juice supplier in Brazil), and Eckes Granini (a leading supplier of fruit juices and beverages)."
"As of December 2021, the project had reached 800 orange growers through the dissemination of information using digital tools such as messaging apps, videos and live streams, and a website where farmers can download training manuals, booklets, etc."
"The project also included more than 300 visits by agriculture extension workers, who provide advisory services to farms and tailored action plans, and a signed partnership agreement with the Sylvio Moreira Citriculture Center (CCSM) of the Campinas Agronomic Institute (IAC)."
The project will utilize CCSM/IAC's demonstration farm to showcase and demonstrate sustainable agricultural practices to farmers.
The projects goal for 2022 is to improve the agricultural practices of at least 200 orange farmers.

"Executive Summary The Coca-Cola Company 2021 Business & ESG Report 45CEO Message Portfolio Data Appendix Our Company People Packaging Frameworks Water Operations Climate Agriculture Supporting Regenerative Agriculture By restoring and rebuilding degraded soils, regenerative agricultural practices can conserve and rehabilitate farmland, increase biodiversity and yield, build resilience to climate change and improve the water cycle."
"Many of our water replenishment programs promote regenerative farming practices such as no-till/reduced/ conservation tillage, precision agriculture, edge of field practices, crop rotations, the use of cover crops and efficient use of fertilizers/compost."
"In Turkey, for example, we have been working in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry General Directorate of Agricultural Reform and the Nature Conservation Centre to introduce regenerative agricultural practices in Konya province."
"Begun in 2013 on 125 hectares, the project expanded these practices to more than 3,500 hectares of farmland."
"Regenerative agricultural practices have resulted in an estimated increase in soil organic matter of at least 30%, an increase in soil moisture content of 10%, and a reduction in required irrigation of 10% during the growing season."
"As a founding member of the SAI Platform's Regenerative Agricultural Programme, which aims to set an industry benchmark for measuring outcomes at the farm level, we are collaborating pre-competitively with industry peers and suppliers to promote and implement regenerative agricultural practices, by supporting the development of tools and guidance documents to build farmer capacity."
"We also continue to be actively involved with SAI Platforms work on Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA), which helps drive relevant and demonstrable continuous improvement of on-farm environmental, social and economic performance through supply chain collaboration and fostering a common understanding of sustainable agriculture."
"Supplier Engagement and Validation To make the biggest impacts, we aim to collaborate with suppliers to engage the farmers in their supply chains to help them improve performance."
This is because The Coca-Cola Company buys our ingredients from suppliers that purchase agricultural raw materials directly from farms or through intermediaries.
"All agricultural-based ingredient and packaging suppliers are informed of our PSA, with clear expectations on making measurable progress in meeting our PSA (on the farms where raw materials for our products are grown), set out through sourcing contracts and other supplier communications."
"Through our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA)-Supplier Guide, we provide guidance to suppliers on implementation of the PSA."
"In partnership with our supply partners, we also support sustainable agriculture initiatives such as: Training and extension services to farmers to implement more sustainable practices that enhance quality, productivity and farmer incomes."
Tools for self-assessment to track progress and continuous improvement of best practices.
"In addition, suppliers of global priority ingredients are required to provide annual letters of attestation detailing the percentage of volume of ingredients sold to us that comply with our PSA."
These letters must specify countries of origin and the relevant verifications and standards that have been met.
"Circular Water Use for Sugar Cane in China As much as 60% of the sugar produced in China comes from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), in an area that suffers from both droughts and floods."
"To help address this challenge, we have been working with The Coca- Cola Foundation, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the China International Center for Economic and Technical Exchanges (CICETE) over the last decade to help increase the production of sugar cane while reducing water use."
This has been done by promoting drip irrigation systems and the use of treated wastewater from nearby sugar mills for irrigation.
The project is a great example of scaling up: it started with direct support by project partners on ~200 hectares in 2011-2013.
"Through the demonstration of the benefits of taking this new sustainable agriculture approach, the Chinese local government supported the projects replication and expansion to an additional 6,500 hectares in 2013 before leading to a full-scale rollout across the entire sugar cane sector in Guangxi."
"As of January 2021, a total of ~350,000 hectares have benefited from agricultural practices piloted by the program, both in Guangxi and neighboring provinces."
CASE STUDY The Water-Agriculture Connection Our comprehensive enterprise Water Footprint assessment showed that 73% of our companys total water footprint and 92% of our freshwater footprint is from growing the ingredients needed for our beverages.
"We have, therefore, integrated ingredient sourcing into our water security vision by unifying our water and sustainable agriculture strategies."
"As we explore ways to address water use in our agriculture supply chain, we are focusing on two main tracks, similar to the approach we have taken for operational water use in our production facilities: Actions we take to promote advanced water management practices for our global priority ingredients grown in water-stressed regions."
Actions we take to improve overall watershed health in priority sourcing regions where our global priority ingredients are grown.
"In 2021 we began developing a Water-Agriculture guidebook to outline a prioritization framework of global priority agricultural ingredients with the highest water dependency and risk, priority sourcing watersheds and relevant suppliers."
The guidebook will provide a system-wide action plan that aligns with the PSA and our water security goal.

"We work to embed respect for human rights across our system through a comprehensive framework of policies, stakeholder engagement, due diligence and remediation."
"Human Rights Due Diligence In line with the UN Guiding Principles, we carry out human rights due diligence across our value chain."
We regularly assess our key human rights risks and ensure that we are taking steps to identify and address them.
"We maintain an industry-leading global audit program of our own operations, as well as those of our bottling partners and Tier 1 suppliers, with over 38,000 human rights assessments conducted since 2003."
We audit facilities using the same protocol in every market where our system and suppliers operate.
"As of the end of 2021, 95% of our own operations, 93% of system bottlers and 92% of our Tier 1 suppliers complied with our rigorous SGP protocols."
These audit results are reviewed by the ESG and Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors on an annual basis.
"Despite falling short of our ambitious goals due to the impact of COVID-19, these results show remarkable improvement across our value chain."
We will continue to advance our human rights strategy and work.
We have also worked to extend our supplier due diligence beyond Tier 1.
"For instance, we collaborate with our Tier 1 ingredient suppliers to drive respect for human rights within their supply chain at the farm-level through our PSA program."
And we have developed a due diligence module specifically tailored to the unique challenges of the informal waste collection sector and our World Without Waste initiative.
More information on our due diligence program can be found in our Human Rights 2022 Overview .

"BanQu Improves Transparency and Traceability in the Recycled Material Supply Chain In South Africa, much of the paper and packaging waste that is collected is sold to small buy-back centers or aggregators before ultimately reaching large recycling companies."
Waste pickers involved in this process typically lack access to formal financial services.
"Enter our new partnership with BanQu, which uses blockchain technology to track, trace and ensure payment for collected recyclable material."
Our Africa operating unit is rolling out the BanQu platform as a service to 100 buy-back centers or aggregators that buy and sell recyclable material.
"The project is providing these small businesses with free access to the BanQu system, allowing them to record their cashless transactions in a blockchain-based system that works with any smartphone or tablet."
Waste pickers also benefit by receiving verification of transactions via text message.
"These records, which are similar to a pay slip, can provide waste pickers with the proof of economic activity necessary to access banking and financial services as well as gain integration with the governments waste picker registry."
"Waste pickers will be able to receive and make payments on the cashless system at low cost, avoiding the risks inherent in handling cash."
"We plan to register around 10,000 waste pickers by the end of 2022. diginexLUMEN Supports Responsible Recruitment Practices In the Middle East, we have a project to help support responsible recruitment of migrant workers."
"We recently partnered with Diginex to develop diginexLUMEN (LUMEN) , a technology-led due diligence and governance tool that can provide greater transparency of the labor recruitment supply chain."
"LUMEN helps to identify and prioritize human rights and labor risks by collecting, verifying and mapping data on recruitment and employment practices from various sources including workers, suppliers and labor agencies."
Risk scoring is used to develop action plans to address risks and ensure continuous improvement in ethical recruitment.
"In 2021, we piloted LUMEN at several locations, including two bottling plants, five supplier facilities and three labor agencies in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar."
We are looking to expand the use of LUMEN to more facilities in the near future.

3 Includes select primary consumer packaging materials.
"4 In 2019, we modified the methodology we use for calculating the amount of recycled material used in our Primary Consumer Packaging."
"These changes are designed to integrate a more accurate dataset, including primary data where it is available."
"Moving forward, we expect that these numbers will continue to evolve as data sources improve, at the same time that we work to increase rates of recycled material use."
5 We changed our method to track the packaging collection rate against our World Without Waste goal beginning with 2018 data.
"With better data available, we expanded the metric to encompass all of our packaging types, including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc."
"6 Collection rate represents a weighted average of national collection rates, collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to TCCSs sales in units to express the percent of equivalent bottles and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling for the year."
"Collection rates are determined by country for each packaging type based on either national studies (approximately 80%), plant standards (approximately 19%), or internal estimates (approximately 1%)."

"2 In 2019, Employee Relations redefined how cases were captured in the case management tool of record."
"Therefore, the reported figure includes only those allegations that required investigations only as opposed to generalized questions raised to Employee Relations."
"Please note, however, that all questions presented to Employee Relations were answered even if the question did not warrant an investigation."
"While we previously reported on all cases and questions raised through our case management tool, we no longer capture that data."
This helps us to ensure that we have more accurate visibility to annual Human Rights cases.

"The Coca-Cola Companys management is responsible for the Subject Matter, in accordance with the Criteria."
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review.
"Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements , and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements ."
Those standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.
"A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the subject matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances."
"A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter is in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion."
"Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion."
A review also does not provide assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination.
We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.
"In performing our review, we have also complied with the independence and other ethical requirements set forth in the Code of Professional Conduct and applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA."
"As described in Note 3 of Exhibit A, the Subject Matter is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data."
The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements.
The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.
"The information included in The Coca-Cola Companys 2021 Business & ESG Report, other than the Subject Matter, has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our review and, accordingly, we express no conclusion on it."
"Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the Schedule of Selected Sustainability Indicators as of (for the year ended) December 31, 2021 in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria."

"3 Starting in 2021, fatalities are no longer reported as LTIs."
Fatalities that may occur are documented and governed through a separate incident management and crisis resolution process.
INDICATOR NAME CRITERIA Greenhouse gas emissions (manufacturing activities) The criteria can be found in the Carbon Accounting Manual .
This includes manufacturing-related scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions and scope 3 CO2e emissions from franchises.
"Emissions from standalone (i.e., not co-located) warehouses, distribution centers and offices (based on emissions being lower than the threshold of five percent of total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) are excluded, CO2 loss during production and AC/Chiller are excluded."
Lost time incident rate The Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) represents the number of Lost Time Incidents (LTI) per 100 employees and contractors.
"Total LTI is multiplied by 200,000 (100 full time equivalent employees working 40 hours per week for 50 weeks) then divided by the number of hours worked for the reporting period."
"Scope: The scope of reporting is limited to self-reported or witness-reported data collected for TCCC and active company-owned or controlled production facilities, distribution centers, offices, laboratories and route-to-market (fleet) operations as of December 31, 2021."
"Global Ventures2, CHI Limited (CHI), fairlife and BODYARMOR are excluded."
The exclusion represents approximately 31% of employees.
"Lost Time Incident: An LTI is a reported work-related injury or illness that results in one or more Lost Days.3 TCCCs LTIR was determined as of March 15, 2022, for injuries occurring during the year ended December 31, 2021 as a minor incident developing into an LTI over time could result in additional LTIs."
"Lost day: A Lost Day occurs when, in the opinion of the medical professional of record, the employees work-related injury or illness prevents the person from being able to work for one or more days."
"The first counted Lost Day is the first day following the injury, regardless of whether it was a scheduled workday, and ends when the person is able, in the opinion of the medical professional of record, to return to work, leaves employment, or reaches 180 Lost Days."
Hours worked: The hours worked include total hours worked during the reporting period by all employees.
"This excludes hours not worked, such as vacation, holidays, or absences."
"Employees and contractors: Employees and contractors include all hourly, salary and temporary employees who are on the payroll of the company (as well as non-payroll contractors and temporary employees for whom facility or fleet management provides day-to-day supervision of their work and provides the details, means, methods and processes by which the work objective is accomplished)."
Uncertainties in reported LTIR: LTIR is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data.
"The number of LTIs is based upon employees and contractors self-reporting or witnesses reporting work-related injuries or illnesses to TCCC which may be affected by culture, societal norms and/or local laws and regulations."
"To the extent an LTI is not reported, it would not be included in the LTIR calculation."
Note 2: Selected Sustainability Indicators Criteria Note 1: Scope of Reporting The Coca-Cola global business system is composed of the Coca-Cola company (TCCC) and 225 bottling partners.
"TCCC markets, manufactures and sells beverage concentrates and syrups and finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages."
"Our bottling partners are independent bottling operations authorized through bottlers agreements to prepare, package, distribute and sell finished beverages to customers and/or consumers."
"TCCC and its bottling partners together are collectively known as The Coca-Cola system (TCCS), or simply system."
"Although the system is not a single entity from a legal or managerial perspective, TCCC strives to positively influence environmental activities and policies throughout the bottling system and to become more transparent by reporting information from both company-owned operations and the broader system."
Contract manufacturers are also used to manufacture and distribute Coca-Cola brands.
TCCC provides a reasonable time period before including newly acquired facilities in the organizational boundary.
This allows for the implementation of sustainability data collection policies and procedures.
"In general, newly acquired facility sustainability data will be included within the first two calendar years that operational sustainability data are available."
"An exception has been granted for our January 2019 acquisition of Costa Limited, which includes retail stores and roasteries, in which additional time has been allowed due to the fundamental difference in the business model."
"Overview Financial & Portfolio Data Packaging Water Greenhouse Gas Emissions & Waste Workplace, Safety & Giving Back Human Rights & Agriculture Assurance Statement Executive Summary The Coca-Cola Company 2021 Business & ESG Report 83CEO Message Agriculture Portfolio Our Company People Packaging Frameworks Water Operations Climate Data Appendix 4 Methodology used in 2021 remains unchanged from prior years."
"In 2022, TCCC expects to report on water replenished in accordance with its 2030 Water Security Strategy."
5 Sales volume is measured in number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners (Coca-Cola system) to customers as reported by TCCC and the bottlers to TCCC and disclosed in the 2021 10-K.
A unit case is a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.
S. fluid ounces (5.678 liters) of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings).
Refer to TCCC 2021 10-K for additional information regarding the 2021 measured unit cases.6 Primary consumer packaging represents that in direct contact with the product itself.
7 Material from industrial waste streams that have been diverted to recycling.
Reworked or reground material within the same facility does not count towards this category.
8 Material generated by households or facilities in their role as end-users of a product which can no longer be used for its initial intended purpose.
INDICATOR NAME CRITERIA Water replenished4 The intent of the replenish program is to develop a global portfolio of Community Water Partnership (CWP) projects that yield an annual volumetric water benefit equivalent to the companys annual global sales volume.
"Water replenish is defined as the ratio of the volume of water safely provided to communities and to nature by the CWP portfolio divided by the sales volume of company beverage products as disclosed in the 2021 10-K.5 Volumetric project benefits are quantified using TCCCs peer reviewed methodology as outlined in the Corporate Water Stewardship: Achieving a Sustainable Balance paper published in the Journal of Management and Sustainability in November 2013, or the methodology described in Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting (VWBA): A Method for Implementing and Valuing Water Stewardship Activities (2019), which builds on the 2013 paper."
There are three primary CWP project types: 1.
Watershed Protection and Restoration 2.
Water Access and Sanitation 3.
"Water for Productive Use While public education, awareness programs and business engagement on water policy reform are critical responses to water risks and challenges, the water replenish contributions from such efforts cannot reliably be quantified and are not included in the water replenish indicator."
"As many replenish projects are co-financed with partners, TCCC claims the portion of the total water benefits equivalent to the companys cost share for the project."
TCCC also claims the annual water benefits from each project following a benefit duration framework of up to 15 years as long as the projects remain in productive service; benefits of reforestation and land conservation projects may be claimed for up to 20 years with documentation that ecosystem services and biodiversity are being achieved.
"For individual projects with benefits greater than 5% of global sales volume, benefit caps are unchanged from 2020, which are based on 5% of global sales volume or 100% of the business unit sales volume, whichever is greater."
Water use ratio Water use ratio (efficiency) is defined as liters of water used per liter of product produced.
"Total water used is the total of all water used by TCCS in all global production facilities and co-located distribution centers, from all sources, including municipal, well and spring, surface, sea, and collected rain."
This includes water used for: production; water treatment; boiler makeup; cooling (contact and non-contact); cleaning and sanitation; backwashing filters; irrigation; washing trucks and other vehicles; kitchen or canteen; toilets and sinks; and fire control.
This does not include return water or non-branded bulk water donated to the community.
"Liters of product produced include all production, not just saleable products."
"Percent of recycled material used in select global primary consumer packaging (Recycled content)Recycled material used in select global primary consumer packaging6 is expressed as a percent of packaging material used in manufacturing as occurring within TCCS, not within co-packing operations."
"Select global primary consumer packaging includes the following for TCCS: Aluminum cans Beverage cartons (e.g., aseptic fiber packaging, including juice boxes) Non-refillable glass bottles Non-refillable PET bottles Refillable glass bottles Refillable PET bottles Steel cans Coffee cups, coffee pods, tea bags, fountain cups and cold drink cups, other (e.g., aluminum bottles and prepackaged non-refillable plastic cups) and food packaging are excluded."
Recycled material is comprised of pre-consumer7 and/or post-consumer8 material.
"Metric tonnes of recycled material in packaging (e.g., PET, cartons, steel) is collected based on weight purchased and received throughout the year (e.g., invoices, goods received)."
"For glass and aluminum packaging, recycled material percentages for the year are self-reported by suppliers and applied to the packaging footprint."
"In some cases, the supplier-provided percentages for the year are primary data; in other cases, the percentages are estimated or based on supplier-provided country or industry averages."
"When recycled content for the reporting period is not provided or is not available, zero is assumed."
"Packaging footprint is defined as the total packaging used, in metric tonnes, for the specific packaging type."
Packaging data is calculated based upon packaging volumes delivered to facilities or packaging entered into production in a calendar year.

The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements.
The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary.
"INDICATOR NAME CRITERIA Percent of the equivalent bottles and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling (Collection rate)Collection rate represents a weighted average of national collection rates, collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to TCCSs sales in units to express the percent of equivalent bottles and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling for the year."
"Collection rates are determined by country for each packaging type based on either national studies (approximately 80%), plant standards (approximately 19%), or internal estimates (approximately 1%)."
"National studies are performed by external third parties such as governments, industry organizations, nongovernmental organizations, recyclers, and consultancies, which may include those engaged by TCCC (See Note A)."
A plant standard9 is applied for refillable glass and PET packaging.
"Internal estimates are used where they are dependent on third-party (e.g., recycler or waste picker) data and assumptions."
"Where data is not available, recycling rates are assumed to be zero."
"In addition to assessing the body performing the study to determine recycling rate, we consider the alignment of geographic scope, sector scope, issuing data, unit of measure and timing of studies performed."
"Sales in units are measured for the following select primary consumer packaging types: Aluminum cans Beverage cartons (i.e., aseptic fiber packaging, including juice boxes) Non-refillable glass bottles Non-refillable PET bottles Pouches Refillable glass bottles Refillable PET bottles Steel cans Other (e.g., aluminum bottles and pre-packaged non-refillable plastic cups) Coffee cups, coffee pods, fountain cups and cold drink cups, and food packaging are excluded."
Note A: Hundreds of source documents were provided by operating units and bottlers to determine collection rates.
"Collection rates used represent the best information at the time of publication of this report, which is generally within three years of publication."
"Global gender representation The gender of global full-time, part-time and temporary active corporate employees by management level10 for TCCC is self-reported by employees in TCCCs Human Resources system as of December 31, 2021."
"Reported global corporate employees represent approximately 22% of TCCC employees as it excludes those working within the Bottlers Investment Group and Global Ventures as well as newly acquired entities CHI, fairlife and BODYARMOR."
"US Ethnic/Racial representation The ethnicity/race of the full-time, part-time and temporary active TCCC corporate employees with a US work location as self-reported by employees in TCCCs Human Resources system as of December 31, 2021."
Reported US corporate employees represent approximately 89% of the TCCC US employees as it excludes those working within the Bottlers Investment Group and Global Ventures as well as newly acquired entities fairlife and BODYARMOR.
"9 The plant standard for refillables is calculated as 1-1/n, where n is the number of uses."
"For refillable glass, uses are capped at n=20 or 95% collection rate."
"For refillable PET, uses are capped at n=5 or 80% collection rate."
"10 Senior Leadership is defined as employees with Job Grades 14 and above, Middle Management as Job Grades 10-13 and Professionals as Job Grades 9 and below as recorded in the Companys Human Resources systems."
