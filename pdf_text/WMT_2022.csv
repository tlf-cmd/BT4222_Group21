"Our founder, Sam Walton, gave us a timeless and meaningful purpose to save people money and help them live a better life ."
"As we celebrate Walmarts 60 th anniversary this year, that purpose still guides us as we work to create environmental, social and economic progress in ways that strengthen our business and benefit our stakeholders."
"We believe a businesss long-term success will depend on its work to help create a strong, resilient society for all."
"In 2005, we committed to shifting our mindset and broadening our view to take a multi-stakeholder approach to our business."
"This means not only do we want to be the primary destination for our customers and return value to our shareholders, but we want to do it in a way that creates value for all stakeholders including our associates, suppliers and other partners, communities and the planet."
"As we engage and serve our stakeholders, we grow and strengthen our businessand vice versa."
"If the past couple years have reinforced anything, its the need for this kind of shared value approach."
"At Walmart, this isnt something sprinkled throughout our business or added on as an afterthoughtwe strive to use this approach in all aspects of our business and help guide us."
"Throughout our journey, we have set goals, measured progress and reported on that progress."
"And we continually push ourselves, which is why we elevated our aspiration by making a commitment to become a regenerative companyone that puts people and nature at the center of our business practices."
This commitment touches all parts of our business.
"It is anchored in our purposeand we do that in a way that strives to create equitable opportunity for our associates and suppliers, enhance the sustainability of retail and product supply chains, help create more resilient communities and operate with the highest standards of ethics and integrity."
Having a healthy business for the long-term requires healthy relationships and a healthy planet.
It also requires trust.
It starts with us living our value of acting with integrity.
We aim to do that throughout all our work.
There is a path of opportunity for everyone here.
"As Ive visited stores, clubs and DCs over the past year, Ive enjoyed talking with the many associates who are creating long, meaningful careers at Walmart."
"Last year, we promoted more than 135,000 associates to positions of greater responsibility and we continue to support and invest in them with job training, rising wages and by making it easier to gain a college degree or certificate by covering the costs of tuition and books through our Live Better U program."
In the U.
"S., 40 percent of management promotions went to people of color and 45 percent to women."
Creating opportunities for people is an important part of our work to become a regenerative company and we believe our success will depend on advancing prosperity and equity for all.
It is also at the heart of our work with communities.
"When disaster strikes, we are there with food, water and helping handsbut we are there every day strengthening communities."
"Last year, in the U."
"S. alone, our associates volunteered close to 1,000 hours a day to causes they care about and the company donated more than $1.5 billion in cash, food and other products globally."
"Our experience confirms for us that, when we understand what a community needs and partner with others, we can strengthen the environment to create more opportunities for the people who live there and end up with a stronger business."
Regeneration also means strengthening our planet.
"This spring, we hit a major milestone with Project Gigaton: We are halfway toward our goal to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of greenhouse gases from the global supply chain by 2030."
"Since 2017, our suppliers have reported a cumulative total of more than 574 million metric tons of emissions reduced or avoided."
"Additionally, we recently raised $2 billion through our first green bond and for the past four years we have received an A or A- score from CDP for our transparency on climate action."
"After 60 years in business, we are reflecting on the moments of celebration, challenge and change throughout our history."
These milestones have a way of making you think about the future.
"Though youll see some of the progress weve made this past year in this report, we know theres more to be done."
"We will continue to look for ways to make a difference and remain eager to collaboratewe need more businesses and NGOs, as well as governments, to get involved and do more."
This work requires collective action.
"When our children and grandchildren look back at the work were doing now, I hope its clear we were part of the solutionworking every day to make this world a better place."
"For as long as were on this planet, Walmart will keep doing just that."
"Doug McMillon President and Chief Executive Officer Walmart Inc. 8ETHICS & INTEGRITY COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY OPPORTUNITY INTRODUCTION A MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICER As we go to press, the world faces uncertainty: COVID-19 waves continue; inflation has kicked up while supply chains remain volatile; the effects of climate change have intensified; social divides seem to have widened."
"Yet despite such challengesor as much spurred on by them we are more committed than ever to our efforts to become a regenerative company, one that puts humanity and nature at the center of our business practices."
"We believe that we maximize the value of our company for our customers and other stakeholders by tackling relevant, pressing societal issues through business."
"In the pages of this years FY2022 Summary and the accompanying ESG Issue Briefs, we share our aspirations, strategies, progress and challenges related to our priority environmental, social and governance issues."
A few observations about our FY2022 disclosures: Whos #1?
"The customer, always."
"In a year where so many communities turned to Walmart for access to affordable food, consumables, COVID-19 vaccines and other everyday essentials, it became clearer than ever that delivering our customer proposition is itself a central ESG contribution."
Progress on rewiring systems for equity.
"Because advancing equity in society requires transformation of complex systems, our strategies in arenas such as economic mobility, racial equity and human rights in supply chains involve long-term, intensive collaboration with others on business and philanthropic initiatives extending beyond the four walls of our company."
Substantial improvements in outcomes may be years in the making.
"Yet we are encouraged by emerging shifts in mindsets, practices, resource flows and policies within each of these arenas as well as progress within our own company."
Climate action: more than promises.
"In the lead up to COP26 in Glasgow, many companies set goals to help the world get to net-zero emissions."
Walmart has been engaging in climate action since 2005 and enlisting suppliers to do the same since the launch of Project Gigaton in 2017.
"This year we reported that we continue to make progress toward our science-based targets for emissions reduction (for example, reporting a 17.5% reduction in FY2021 relative to our 2015 baseline for Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and we significantly expanded our efforts and disclosures related to our nature goals."
No simple solutions.
"When it comes to complex societal issues, stakeholders dont always agree on the way forward and there can be many obstacles to progress."
"Through our ESG reporting, we aim to provide insight into Walmarts theories of change, systemic challenges and the efforts of Walmart teams and our partners to overcome them."
Decision-useful reporting.
Investors have asked businesses for more consistent and relevant ESG information.
"Nobody wants an avalanche of data orat the opposite end of the spectrumhigh-level headlines; they want concrete facts regarding policies, practices and results relevant to the creation of shared value."
We aim to set the standard for decision-useful reporting.
"This year, we have responded to investor requests for expanded disclosure in specific arenas (for example, public policy engagement; approach to nature)."
"We continue to aim for consistency and relevance through the structure of our ESG issue briefs and approach to metrics (e.g., clear definitions; sharing progress for the last three fiscal years)."
"A rose by any other name Debates have intensified about terminologyESG, stakeholder capitalism, inclusive capitalism, shared value, etc.and whether all of this is just a passing fad."
Our view is simple: a companys long -term success depends on its performance on the societal issues most relevant to its business and stakeholders.
"We cant have a strong business without a thriving planet and the trust and engagement of customers, associates, suppliers, investors, civic partners and communities."
And the fundamentals of that are here to stay.
We remain optimistic.
"In Walmart communities around the world, our customers, associates, suppliers and civic partners help one another live better every day in a million ways, big and small."
Thank you for your engagement to make us a better company.

"We believe we maximize long-term value for shareholders by serving our stakeholders: delivering value to our customers, creating economic opportunity for associates and suppliers, strengthening local communities and enhancing the environmental and social sustainability of our business and product supply chains."
"Addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business by extending our license to operate, building customer and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing cost and risk, building capabilities for future advantage and strengthening the underlying systems we all rely on."
"In other words, business thrives by serving society: as business strengthens society, serving society strengthens business."
We aspire to become a regenerative companyhelping to renew people and the planet through our business.
The primary way that we create value for society is by bringing everyday essentials to people who need them.
"People need safer and healthier foods, quality general merchandise and critical services like pharmacy and healthcare."
And they need them at affordable prices.
"Sam Walton saw such a need in small-town America when he opened the first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas in 1962."
"Sixty years later, Walmart meets that need through its presence in thousands of communities around the world."
Whats good for business is good for society and vice versa.
Each of our ESG priority issue areas offers a discrete shared -value proposition: an opportunity to meet a societal need through our business.
"In each instance, our aspiration is to operate our business in a regenerative way."
Doing so aligns our business objectives with societal objectives and increases our ability to create value for the long term.
"12 ETHICS & INTEGRITY COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY OPPORTUNITY INTRODUCTION white bo x element OUR APPROACH TO PRIORITY ESG ISSUES For each priority ESG issue, we develop an ESG impact thesis that articulates the relevance of the issue for society and Walmarts business, reflects an understanding of stakeholder expectations and defines our aspirations, goals and strategies."

Annual scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions and Carbon Intensities are updated from time to time for changes in emission factors or activity data when more accurate information become available.
This may result in updated emissions reported in the ESG Climate Brief that may not correspond to results reported to CDP for our annual Climate Change questionnaire.
"We engage Lucideon CICS to independently verify Walmarts reported scope 1 and scope 2 emissions as reported to CDP annually, pursuant to ISO 14064-3 (the international standard for verification of Greenhouse Gas inventories)."
"We follow Walmarts Greenhouse Gas Inventory Methodology, which is attached to our CDP disclosures."
Our methodology is consistent with the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Developments Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (The GHG Protocol) for corporate GHG accounting and reporting.
scope 2 (market-based) emissions include the carbon reduction value of renewable electricity procured from onsite and offsite projects.
The GHG Protocol outlines three emissions sources (referred to as scopes) that provide the framework for operational boundaries.
"The three scopes are: Scope 1, Direct Emissions, represent emissions from the combustible fuels and other sources that occur directly on sites (e.g., refrigerants,) and mobile emissions sources.jj Scope 2, Indirect Emissions, represent emissions that occur off-site to produce electricity or steam purchased for use at corporate locations."
"Scope 3, Other Indirect Emissions, represents emissions from activities down or upstream from a companys core business such as product use, waste disposal, commuting and business travel."
3.
"On an adjusted basis between 2015 calendar year baseline and 2020, Walmart reduced its absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 15.6%, equivalent to 3.0 million metric tons of CO 2e."
Adjustments may include the effects of acquisitions and divestitures for the period in which they had an effect.

Packaging metrics are measured in weight and based on supplier reports through a supplier survey.
Proxy data were calculated to provide data for suppliers that did not complete the survey or provided unusable data.
Proxy data are meant to represent an estimate of how much packaging those suppliers / markets may utilize to provide an overall picture of Walmarts entire packaging footprint.
The calculation is based on supplier participation in the survey as a percentage of net sales and known packaging data.
Walmart private brand suppliers representing 73% of Walmart global private brand net sales reported packaging data in 2019; in 2020 the figure was 78% and in 2021 the figure was 80%.

"Because of the sale of Walmarts Argentina business in late 2020, we were unable to capture sufficient packaging data for the Argentina market; to represent this markets business in 2020, we used the 2018-2019 private brand packaging survey for Argentina."
Walmart divested its businesses in the U.
"K. and Japan in early 2021; because the businesses were divested early in the year, we did not proxy packaging data for the time Walmart owned those businesses and the 2021 packaging figures represented here do not include the U."

"Calculation follows the 2021 Reporting Guidelines for The New Plastics Global Commitment and includes all private brand primary, secondary and tertiary plastic packaging, including single-use plastic and reusable plastic bags globally."
"For the time frame of the private brands packaging survey, we instructed suppliers to use their latest or most recent 12-month period for which they have data available."
"If they reported last year, use the same reporting period as the initial/prior reporting year to avoid gaps or overlap with the prior years submissions."
"For suppliers that did not complete the survey or provided unusable data, proxy data was substituted to provide a full estimate of global private brand packaging."
"For the proxy calculation, a market level approach was used."
