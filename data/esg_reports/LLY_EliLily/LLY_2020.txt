A Message from Our 
CEO 
David A. Ricks 
Chairman and CEO 
Dear Stakeholders, 
Events of the past year serve as a powerful reminder that we must be willing to take bold, concerted action to improve human 
health, strengthen our social fabric and defend our natural environment. 
Our purpose is to make new medicines that make life better for people around the world. While leveraging science and medicine to 
improve lives is by itself sustaining for humankind, we understand discovering, developing and making medicines alone is not 
enough. We’re investing in new ways to make medicines and care more accessible, affordable and useful for everyone who needs 
them. To do this, we are reaching across industry and geographic boundaries to collaborate with all who share our goals of 
accelerating and improving access in the health-care system. We further extend our impact by strengthening communities and 
making a positive difference in greater social issues that matter to our business, our employees and society. 
The broad overall policy of this concern is to conduct its affairs so that 'the 
greatest good for the greatest number over the longest period of time' will 
result. 
Mr. Eli Lilly 
1947 
Lilly’s COVID-19 response exemplifies each of these elements, as we applied the full force of our scientific expertise to combat the 
pandemic and its devastating effects on our most vulnerable communities and health systems around the world. We moved quickly 
to protect the well-being of our workforce, led the response to enormous testing deficits in our home state and collaborated across 
public and private sectors to discover new COVID-19 antibodies in record time – all while maintaining a steady supply of medicines 
for about 45 million people who rely on us. 
Although we aren’t done battling COVID-19, we are changed by this challenge. More than ever, we see the positive impact we can 
have to improve the human condition through new medicine coupled with responsible and sustainable actions, to ensure more 
people benefit and our work fits into the broader challenges the world faces. Key to this effort is prioritizing Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) goals and investing in resources to expand our progress. 
Sustainability at Lilly 
For Lilly, sustainability starts with our purpose and is guided by our long-standing values of integrity, excellence and respect for 
people. Sustainability has always been central to Lilly, and we dedicate ourselves to ensuring our sustainability efforts help address 
important issues for our business, our employees and society. 
As we enter our 146th year, we have evolved and continue to evolve our sustainability efforts. After seeking input from a broad 
spectrum of stakeholders, we identified key ESG topics relevant for our company and industry, created a new position to lead ESG 
strategy and adopted common reporting frameworks. We’ll use the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task 
Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) frameworks and continue to report our progress on the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals. We have also created this ESG site to provide a comprehensive picture of our sustainability 
strategy, goals and results. 
To provide ESG governance and oversight, we have clear lines of responsibility from Lilly’s board of directors and executive 
committee to an ESG governance committee that is responsible for operationalizing our strategy. 
Human Capital Management is Foundational 
Whatever we accomplish is made possible by our talented, dedicated people. Fulfilling our purpose requires highly skilled employees 
to be fully engaged in solving the world’s toughest health challenges. We provide support for our global workforce through wide- 
ranging opportunities for training, leadership development and well-being. We work every day to build a diverse, equitable and 
inclusive culture where everyone is valued and heard, and we’ve made measurable progress across our workforce, management, 
corporate leadership and board of directors. 
Engaging our Communities and Serving our Patients 
We’re taking action to improve equity more broadly as well, launching a Racial Justice Initiative to augment the work we’re doing 
both within Lilly and in our communities. We’re expanding diversity in our clinical trials, increasing employment opportunities and 
investing in new health care initiatives for marginalized communities. In early 2021, we also announced a $30 million investment in 
the Unseen Capital Health Fund to support founders and innovators who are enhancing health access in historically marginalized 
communities across the U.S. 
Globally, Lilly partners to improve access to our medicines and tackle complex health challenges. We aim to improve access to 
quality health care for 30 million people living in limited-resource settings annually by 2030. In our battle against COVID-19, we’ve 
collaborated with the Gates Foundation to supply our treatment antibodies to low- and middle-income countries. 
We use philanthropy and shared-value approaches to improve health systems and concentrate on diseases where we have deep 
technical expertise, such as our collaboration with Life for a Child that will expand access to care for approximately 150,000 youth 
with diabetes across 65 countries. We’ve also made a $100 million commitment to the pharma-led AMR Action Fund, the world’s 
largest public-private partnership addressing the global health threat of antibiotic-resistant infections. 
In the U.S., as we work to advance discussions to address structural factors that increase costs to patients, we continue to partner 
with the nonprofit and public sectors to help millions of people gain access to Lilly medicines. As an example, Lilly insulins are now 
available to patients for $35 or less per month, with or without insurance. 
Protecting the Planet 
Because making medicines requires the use of valuable resources, including energy, water and raw materials, we work to reduce our 
environmental footprint with a focus on addressing climate change, waste and water security. We believe that maintaining a safe 
operation for our workers and communities is our first responsibility – no one should get hurt at work or in our communities 
because of our work. 
We’ve set ambitious 2030 environmental goals. For climate, we plan to secure 100% of our purchased electricity from renewable 
sources, make our own operations carbon neutral and enhance tracking and reporting of our full value-chain emissions. For waste, 
our goals are to send zero waste to landfills from our routine operations, to repurpose 100% of plastic waste for beneficial use – 
with at least 90% recycled or reused and to integrate sustainability-focused design principles into product and packaging design 
processes. Finally, for water, we plan to establish and conform to water management plans for Lilly sites in water-stressed areas, 
and continue to have 100% of Lilly sites meet predicted no-effect concentrations for pharmaceuticals in the environment. We will 
ensure appropriate controls are in place with Lilly contract manufacturers to prevent discharge of pharmaceuticals in wastewater 
above applicable no-effect concentration values. 
ESG is How we Operate 
More important than setting ambitious goals is achieving them. This starts with embedding annual goals into the performance 
targets of the CEO and key executives. We review progress on these goals as a full executive committee quarterly and the board 
annually. Leaders are responsible for embedding these targets throughout their operations and are held accountable for progress 
and ultimately the achievement of our targets, including through the annual compensation process. When challenges arise, we 
expect our team to work to overcome them and to treat ESG objectives no differently than other vital business challenges. 
Together with the support of our stakeholders, the contributions of our Lilly colleagues and our partners across the health-care 
system, we believe we can fulfill the charge of Eli Lilly, our company’s founder: “Take what you find here and make it better and 
better.”

Pricing in the U.S. 
Pricing our medicines is one of the most important decisions we make as a company. We aim to strike a 
balance between access and affordability for patients while sustaining investments in life-changing 
treatments for some of today’s most serious diseases. When making pricing considerations, we take into 
account the following: 
Customer perspective – The unmet needs that medicines can fulfill for patients and caregivers and how 
people can affordably access the treatment; 
Company considerations – The costs of research, development, manufacturing and support services for 
customers; business trends and other economic factors; as well as the medicine’s potential market size, 
patent life and place within our larger portfolio of medicines; 
Competitive landscape –The benefits of our medicine compared to alternative medicines, where our 
medicine fits in treating conditions and existing contracts between payers and our competitors; 
Other external factors – Such as health system changes and policy guidelines. 
The way that medicines are paid for in the current health-care system may seem confusing. In the U.S., here’s 
how we approach pricing our medicines: 
We set a list price for each of our medicines, taking into account the value provided to patients, 
affordability, the competitive landscape, research costs, manufacturing, marketing and support services 
provided, as well as other factors such as health system changes. 
To expand patient access, we pay rebates and other discounts to payers, pharmacy benefit managers 
(PBMs) and other supply chain entities such as wholesalers and distributors. 
After paying these rebates and discounts, the final dollar amount that Lilly ultimately receives is called the 
net price. 
We are committed to increasing transparency around the price of our medicines. List prices for our 
medicines, as well as average out-of-pocket costs and financial assistance information are published here . 
Changes in Lilly’s Net Price: 2015-2020 
The rebates and discounts we pay to PBMs, insurers, the government and other supply chain entities have 
continued to grow over the years, not just for insulin, but for Lilly’s entire U.S. portfolio. We support the 
restructuring of financial incentives for the entire pharmaceutical supply chain to ensure patients directly 
benefit from these rebates and discounts at the pharmacy counter.

Data may be revised compared to prior reports due to changes in calculation methodology and other factors. Some segments do not add up to 
totals due to rounding. 
In 2019, Lilly adjusted its environmental performance data baseline calculations and performance data for subsequent years for all categories 
except the Energy, Waste and Water Reduction Fund to reflect the late 2018 divestiture of Elanco Animal Health. In order to facilitate year-over- 
year comparisons, this adjustment included the Environmental Compliance data. 
This metric includes Scope 1 emissions and energy from onsite fuel combustion (excluding mobile sources) and Scope 2 emissions and energy 
from site-purchased energy (i.e., electricity, steam and chilled water). For smaller locations not billed directly to Lilly, data is estimated based on 
square footage. 
Data included in Scope 3 emissions disclosure contain assumptions and estimation as described here: Employee business travel (personal and 
rental cars, taxi, rail, and air travel) uses WRI GHG Protocol Cross-Sector Tool averages for fuel types, vehicle types, aircraft types, and aircraft 
travel distances; employee commuting uses EPA average for fuel types, vehicle types, and commuting distances; contracted product 
transportation and distribution is based on Lilly’s U.S. distribution footprint and extrapolated for distribution outside the United States; waste 
generated in operations uses Lilly-specific waste carbon content estimates for waste incineration and EPA’s WARM version 12 emission factors 
for landfilled and land-applied waste, and assumes transportation related emissions only for certain land-applied organic waste types. Scope 3 
emissions from employees commuting were adjusted to reflect the proportion of employees working remotely during 2020; No additional 
scope 3 emissions from remote working were included. Scope 3 Emissions do not include non-Kyoto compounds. Scope 3 data does not 
include emissions from sales force travel using company vehicles, use of Lilly owned aircraft, on-site waste incineration, or product distribution 
with Lilly owned vehicles, as these are included in the Scope 1 data above. 
Energy consumption is the total of direct energy consumption and indirect energy consumption, as defined in these footnotes, and does not 
include mobile sources. 
Data includes energy from combustion of coal, fuel oil, natural gas, and liquid propane. 
Data includes energy from purchased electricity, steam, and chilled water. 
Because currently Lilly does not have goals related to Energy, Waste and Water Reduction Fund expenditures, there are no baseline years.

Lilly’s 2020 waste goals do not include materials that are deemed “reused” without extensive processing. Examples include urea reused for 
fertilizer and materials such as soil and concrete reused as clean fill. 
The baseline year for waste metrics is 2012.

Footnotes 
“Water intake” is the total amount of water coming into a site, including water pumped from bodies of surface water and groundwater, as well as 
water provided by a utility. It includes water used in processes, utilities, and other ancillary operations, such as irrigation. The term does not 
include groundwater pumped solely for treatment to satisfy regulatory actions or requirements (e.g., remediation activities where the water is 
not used for another purpose). Values do not include the water extracted from wells solely for the purpose of lowering the groundwater table(s) 
to maintain the physical and structural integrity of building foundations. Totals include a small amount of rainwater intake not included in other 
water intake subcategories. Lilly does not generally collect water data from small locations that house primarily administrative activities such as 
sales and marketing offices unless they are co-located at a Lilly manufacturing or research facility. 
Because currently Lilly does not have goals related to water intake there is no baseline year. 
In 2018, Lilly met its 2020 goal of reducing phosphorus emissions to wastewater by 15% compared to the baseline year of 2014. We then set an 
additional 10% reduction goal using 2018 as the new baseline year and adjusted 2018 data for the divestiture of Lilly’s former subsidiary Elanco 
Animal Health in late 2018. Because the initial goal was achieved, data for years prior to 2018 was not adjusted to reflect subsequent events 
and therefore is not comparable to data for the new goal period.
