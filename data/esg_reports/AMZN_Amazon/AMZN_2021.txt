Delivering Progress for the Planet 
In 2019, we co-founded The Climate Pledge and made a 
commitment to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years 
ahead of the Paris Agreement. We invited others to join 
us and there are now more than 300 businesses and 
organizations across 51 industries and 29 countries that 
have signed the Pledge, which means we are collectively 
coming at the climate crisis from nearly every sector and 
nearly every angle. 
As part of our efforts to decarbonize our business, we 
became the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable 
energy in 2020, and last year, we reached 85% renewable 
energy across our business. We continue to expand our use 
of zero-emission transportation such as electric delivery 
vans, cargo bikes, and on-foot deliveries, and in 2021, more 
than 100 million packages were delivered to our customers’ 
doorsteps globally using zero-emission vehicles. We are also 
investing in nature-based solutions, and last year, we helped 
to create the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest 
finance (LEAF) Coalition—a global initiative of governments 
and leading companies that has already mobilized $1 billion 
to protect the world’s tropical rainforests. We will continue 
to act boldly to address climate change and to invest in 
solutions to help meet our commitment to reach net-zero 
carbon across our operations by 2040.
Delivering Progress for People 
Our ability to be a force for change on behalf of our planet 
relies on diverse perspectives from smart, passionate, 
and committed people from all backgrounds. In 2021, we 
continued to make progress on our diversity goals, including 
increasing the number of Black directors and vice presidents 
by almost 70%, and we remain committed to increasing Vice President, Worldwide 
Sustainability, Amazon
Every day at Amazon, we ask ourselves, “How can we make 
this product, this service, or this experience better for our 
customers?” We continually seek ways to challenge ourselves 
and improve how we deliver for our customers, support 
our employees, and accelerate the pace of innovation. 
This mindset is ingrained in our culture, so every day, we 
apply the same relentless pursuit to delivering progress 
on our sustainability commitments. 
The journey to become more sustainable is not simple or 
straightforward for any organization. For a company of 
the size and broad scope of Amazon, it’s a big challenge. 
But at Amazon, we don’t shy away from big challenges. 
We innovate and create. We don’t have all the answers 
today, but we believe in the need to act now.
This is reflected in one of our newest Leadership Principles, 
introduced last year: Success and Scale Bring Broad 
Responsibility. It says that “we are big, we impact the world, 
and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and 
thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. 
Our local communities, planet, and future generations 
need us to be better every day.” We apply our Leadership 
Principles daily—whether we are discussing ideas for new 
inventions or deciding on the best approach to solve a 
problem. Throughout 2021, we embedded the spirit of 
this Leadership Principle into our everyday actions and 
continued to make progress on our environmental and 
social commitments.diverse representation in our workforce at the most senior 
levels. We’ve helped more than 70,000 Amazon employees 
learn new skills and advance their careers as part of our 
Upskilling 2025 pledge, and we are enabling thousands of 
hourly employees in 14 countries to earn certificates and 
degrees through Amazon Career Choice. Earlier this year, we 
also expanded travel reimbursements for our employees in 
the U.S. to cover treatment for non-life-threatening medical 
issues when travel is required, including elective abortion and 
infertility, starting in 2022.
In our communities, we are supporting initiatives to address 
the affordable housing crisis—including a commitment of 
more than $2 billion from the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, 
launched last year. As of March 2022, these commitments 
have already preserved or created 8,000 affordable units to 
house more than 18,000 people. Also last year—in service 
to people in our communities and supply chain—we signed 
the United Nations’ (UN) Women’s Empowerment Principles, 
which offers businesses guidance on ways to promote 
gender equity in the workplace and global community; we 
created a $150 million Black Business Accelerator program 
in partnership with our Black Employee Network affinity 
group; and we launched a $12 million, five-year partnership 
with the U.S. National Safety Council to uncover new ways 
to prevent and address musculoskeletal disorders.
Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 
2022, we quickly mobilized to provide humanitarian aid and 
assistance to the people of Ukraine, including financial and 
in-kind donations, cloud computing credits, resettlement 
support, and more. We are proud of how our global teams 
came together to support this effort and are honored 
to have been awarded the Ukraine Peace Prize for the 
support AWS has shown the Ukraine government and the 
Ukrainian people.Delivering Progress Every Day 
We are proud of the progress we’ve made, but we 
recognize we have more to do. Our everyday actions to 
deliver progress are in service of achieving long-term, 
systemic change that improves the well-being of people, 
communities, and the planet.
The path to achieving some of our goals will be long and 
complex, but we are not deterred. At Amazon, we thrive on 
pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. We are taking 
the same tenacity we use to invent and problem solve for 
our customers and applying it to how we help address some 
of the world’s biggest challenges. I hope you enjoy learning 
more about how we are doing this as you read our 2021 
Sustainability Report.

Our Business
As part of our mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, we are 
committed to building a sustainable business for our employees, customers, 
and communities, including the people that support our entire value chain. 
Our Operations  
We offer access to a wide selection of products 
sold by us and by third parties across dozens of 
categories. We help make customers’ lives easier 
and more enjoyable through our devices and 
services. We create and provide access to world-class 
content and entertainment. We provide the world’s 
most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud 
offering. All of this and more is underscored by our 
commitment to customer service and a state-of-the-
art logistics and delivery network.Our Communities
We leverage our scale and assets for good to support 
charitable organizations and strengthen communities 
where our employees and customers live and 
work. Our culture is built around solving seemingly 
impossible problems, which is why we take a different, 
more hands-on approach than most. We use this 
approach to support education for underrepresented 
groups, address direct needs including family hunger, 
homelessness, and natural disasters, and protect our 
planet to build a better future for all. Our Supply Chain
Our approach is designed to drive engagement 
with suppliers that meet our expectations for 
respecting human rights, providing safe and inclusive 
workplaces, and promoting a sustainable future. 
We engage with suppliers across the globe that 
are required to meet the standards we outline 
and commit to these principles. Our Customers 
We are always finding new ways to delight our 
customers while constantly aiming to offer lower 
prices, better selections, and more convenient 
services. We serve our primary customer sets in the 
following ways: consumers through our online and 
physical stores; sellers through programs that enable 
them to grow their businesses; developers and 
enterprises of all sizes through AWS; content creators 
through services that enable them to publish and sell 
content; and advertisers through advertising services.
Our Principles We have 16 Leadership Principles , which describe how we do business and how we keep the customer at the 
center of our decisions. In 2021, we added two new Leadership Principles: Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer  
and Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility .

Enabling Global Innovation
Our infrastructure has also been helping scientists gain and 
share knowledge of RNA viruses in record time. Diseases 
caused by RNA viruses include the common cold, influenza, 
SARS, COVID-19, hepatitis C, Ebola, rabies, polio, and measles.
An international team of scientists from the Serratus project 
built a powerful supercomputer on AWS  in just eight weeks. 
The supercomputer searched almost 6 million publicly available 
biological samples for the presence of RNA viruses in less than 
two weeks for $24,000—achieving what would have taken a 
standard computer well over 2,000 years and cost at least 10 
times more. Through this process, the research team used the 
AWS Cloud to identify more than 130,000 new RNA viruses, 
including nine new coronaviruses, creating a “global viral 
surveillance system” that could help prevent future pandemics.
A Helping Hand
In early 2021, Amazon took immediate action to help 
address the COVID-19 surge in India. We utilized our global 
logistics network to purchase, airlift, and deliver medical 
equipment identified as critically needed by the government 
of India and local charities.
We worked with industry partners and nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) to deliver more than 8,000 oxygen 
concentrators and 500 BiPAP machines to India. This medical 
equipment was donated to hospitals and public institutions 
to increase their capacity to help COVID-19-infected patients 
across multiple cities. We also joined the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce’s Global Task Force on Pandemic Response to 
deliver ventilators to India. In Nepal, Amazon teamed up 
with the UN World Food Programme to donate and deliver 
supplies to communities affected by COVID-19, including 
850,000 personal protective items.AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative 
The AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative (DDI)  is a 
two-year, $20 million commitment to accelerate research 
and innovation to advance the collective understanding and 
detection of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in order 
to mitigate current and future outbreaks. 
In the first phase of the AWS DDI , AWS supported 87 
organizations in 17 countries, ranging from nonprofits 
and research institutions to startups and large businesses. 
AWS awarded $8 million to support a range of diagnostic 
projects, including molecular tests for antibodies, antigens, 
and nucleic acids; diagnostic imaging; wearables; and data 
analytics tools that use artificial intelligence and machine 
learning to detect COVID-19. 
In April 2021, AWS launched the next phase and broadened 
the Initiative’s scope to three new areas: 1) early disease 
detection to identify outbreaks at the individual and at the 
community level; 2) prognosis to better understand disease 
trajectory; and 3) public health genomics to bolster viral 
genome sequencing worldwide.
Helping Employees Get Back to Work
When the time came for employees to start returning to 
corporate offices, we engaged with our teams to find out 
what kind of flexibility they needed to keep everyone safe, 
rather than specifying a one-size-fits-all approach for all 
business units. We encouraged leaders to determine how 
many days their team members would be in the office and 
which days those would be, so long as that decision was 
guided by what would be most effective for our customers 
and safest for our employees. Some teams continue working 
mostly remotely, others work a combination of remotely and 
in the office, and others work mostly in the office. Vaccine Support
From March through early December 2021, we hosted 
more than 1,800 on-site vaccination events for front-line 
employees. We also launched the Max Your Vax sweepstakes 
to encourage our front-line operations employees to get 
vaccinated. We offered a variety of weekly prizes—including 
two $500,000 grand prizes, six $100,000 cash prizes, five 
new vehicles valued at $40,000 each, and five vacations each 
valued at $12,000 that included 40 hours of paid time off. 
Empowering Customers to Manage 
Health and Safety
Throughout the pandemic, we have invested billions of 
dollars in the health and safety of our employees and 
customers, including building an in-house COVID-19 testing 
program to ensure front-line employees have access to free, 
regular testing in the U.S. and the UK. 
By January 2021, our national COVID-19 testing lab 
located in Kentucky processed more than 1 million COVID-19 
tests  for front-line employees from more than 700 testing 
sites, and provided access to COVID-19 testing to nearly all 
front -line employees. At the height of the pandemic, our 
labs were processing more than 30,000 tests each day.
We took what we learned from this process to create our 
own at-home COVID-19 test collection kit  for customers. 
The tests received Emergency Use Authorization from the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June 2021, providing 
an affordable, reliable, and convenient way for customers 
to test for COVID-19 at home. The kits are processed by 
Amazon’s in-house laboratory using the diagnostic approach 
recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  
and Prevention . Continuing 
Our COVID-19 
Response
Since the early stages of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, we have 
worked nonstop to make hundreds 
of changes to our operational 
processes to protect the health of 
our employees and communities. In 
2021, amid new variants and further 
lockdowns, we continued to invest 
heavily in supporting our employees, 
customers, and communities.

Operating sustainably is no longer a choice—
it’s an imperative. Making meaningful 
progress to address climate change takes 
unprecedented action across all industries 
and societies. Amazon recognizes this and 
acknowledges that the ways we do business 
have impacts far beyond our own company. 
There’s no time to waste, and that’s why 
we are investing in efforts to protect the

Our Carbon 
Footprint
Climate change is one of the world’s 
greatest crises, and to address it, 
the public and private sectors need 
to act together. That’s why we 
co-founded The Climate Pledge, 
a commitment to reach net-zero 
carbon by 2040—10 years ahead 
of the Paris Agreement. Since we 
created the Pledge in 2019, more 
than 300 companies have joined 
Amazon in making this commitment.The path to decarbonization remains challenging. This 
is especially true for a business of the size and broad 
scope of Amazon. We operate businesses—delivery 
and transportation logistics, physical stores, grocery, 
manufacturing, and cloud computing services—that involve 
moving products, manufacturing goods, and creating 
computing capacity, all at scale. While some of these 
businesses—including cloud computing and e-commerce—
offer greater efficiencies, some are more carbon-intensive 
endeavors. In reducing their carbon footprint through 
investment and innovation, we will enable even greater 
efficiency and more-sustainable choices for our customers. 
As we work to decarbonize our company, Amazon is growing 
rapidly. We have scaled our business at an unprecedented 
pace to help meet the needs of our customers through the 
pandemic. From early 2020 to the end of 2021, we created 
more than 750,000 full-time and part-time jobs worldwide 
and doubled the size of the fulfillment network that we 
had built over the previous 25 years. At the same time, an 
increasing number of companies around the world moved 
their technology to the cloud, gaining significant speed, 
innovation, and cost advantages, and AWS grew its revenue by 
37% year-over-year in 2021. 
These developments meant we had to build new facilities—
for both our consumer and cloud businesses—and expand 
our transportation network. Throughout this growth, we 
remained focused on improving our efficiency through 
more-sustainable solutions, including electric vehicles and 
alternative fuel options as well as wind and solar power 
across our network. In AWS, the team spent considerable 
resource innovating on power efficiency, removing the 
central Uninterruptible Power Supply from our data center design, integrating power supplies into our racks, and 
utilizing Graviton EC2 instances that use up to 60% less 
energy for the same performance than comparable Amazon 
EC2 instances. 
With all of our growth in 2021, our absolute carbon 
emissions increased by 18% in 2021; however, importantly, 
our carbon intensity decreased by 1.9%—this is the third 
year in a row we’ve seen our carbon intensity decrease. 
This measurement quantifies total carbon emissions, in 
grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e), per dollar of 
gross merchandise sales (GMS). As companies invest in 
new products and services, and their businesses grow 
substantially, the focus should not be solely on a company’s 
carbon footprint in terms of absolute carbon emissions, but 
also on whether it’s lowering its carbon intensity. Over time, 
continued decreases in carbon intensity can lead to lower 
absolute emissions. See the Appendix  for our carbon data.
While we’ve had success cutting emissions from some 
operations, we are still early in the process of transforming 
others. Some actions and investments have immediate 
carbon savings, while others will take years to demonstrate 
results. The path to net-zero carbon has many obstacles, 
but we thrive on big challenges. A few of those big 
challenges include: 
• Powering our operations with 100% renewable energy  
by 2025 
• Developing more-sustainable transportation infrastructure 
• Constructing more-sustainable buildings
• Decarbonizing the supply chain Powering Operations With 100% 
Renewable Energy
In 2021, we reached 85% renewable energy across our 
operations, and we are on a path to achieve 100% by 
2025—five years ahead of the original target of 2030. 
This transition to 100% renewable energy benefits our 
customers as well. Studies by the international analyst firm 
451 Research found that moving on-premises computing 
workloads to AWS can lower workload carbon footprint by 
nearly 80% compared to surveyed enterprise data centers. 
That number could improve to as high as 96% once AWS is 
powered with 100% renewable energy—a target we are on 
path to meet by 2025. AWS’ infrastructure is 3.6 times more 
energy efficient than the median of surveyed U.S. enterprise 
data centers and up to five times more energy efficient than 
the average European enterprise data center.

Developing More-Sustainable 
Transportation Infrastructure 
Reducing carbon emissions in transportation is a complex 
challenge for many companies. We plan to make half of 
our shipments net-zero carbon by 2030, and to do that, we 
are creating a worldwide fleet of zero-emission vehicles. 
Right now, the vehicles and charging infrastructure don’t 
exist at the scale needed to serve customers. We need 
the supply to increase dramatically. We have ordered 
100,000 electric vehicles (EVs) from Rivian, and thousands 
more from manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, 
Stellantis, and Mahindra Electric. These orders have sent a 
demand signal that is shifting the market to meet not only 
our needs, but also the needs of other companies around 
the world. 
We announced in November that, in the city of Paris, 
two-thirds of our shipments are delivered using zero-
emission transport such as EVs, electric cargo bikes, and 
on-foot deliveries. We also are exploring green hydrogen technologies: Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund—a corporate 
venture fund that invests in sustainability—recently 
announced it has invested in EH2 in the U.S. and Sunfire 
in Germany, two companies helping to push the green 
hydrogen industry forward.
It will take time to remove carbon emissions from heavy 
transportation systems, including ocean shipping, aviation, 
and trucking. Governments and the private sector need 
to come together on this important work. Amazon is at 
the heart of such industry initiatives and government 
partnerships, including the Cargo Owners for Zero Emission 
Vessels network (coZEV), the First Movers Coalition, the 
Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance Aviators Group (SABA), 
and the Clean Energy Demand Initiative. 
Constructing More-
Sustainable Buildings 
Businesses also face the challenge of removing carbon 
emissions from new building construction. Via The 
Climate Pledge Fund, Amazon has invested in CarbonCure 
Technologies, which enables concrete producers to make the 
same high-quality concrete with a lower carbon footprint, 
and Brimstone Energy, which seeks to make cement carbon-
neutral through a process focused on calcium silicate rocks, 
which have no embedded CO 2, as well as magnesium 
species, which passively absorb CO 2. Amazon is lowering 
the carbon footprint of our buildings by using CarbonCure’s 
systems and Brimstone Energy cement in some new 
construction, including in Amazon’s second headquarters in 
Virginia (HQ2). 
HQ2 will be a model for sustainable construction. We’ve 
electrified the operations of HQ2, eliminating the use of 
fossil fuels for buildings systems and food service. We have 
committed to powering 100% of HQ2’s operations with renewable energy through a combination of off-site and  
on-site solar projects. And we plan to achieve Leadership 
in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum 
certification, the highest sustainability building certification 
issued by the U.S. Green Building Council. 
We also continue to innovate with construction techniques to 
make our fulfillment centers more sustainable. Many of our 
fulfillment facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India 
are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation 
can power up to 80% of the facility’s energy use. As of  
2021, 115 of our global fulfillment facilities have rooftop 
solar installations.Constructing our AWS data centers also presents challenges 
related to sustainability. Concrete and steel used in 
construction are two of the largest contributors of  
embodied carbon in a data center building, and we have 
multiple initiatives to reduce their carbon impact. For 
example, our design standards now require concrete with a 
20% reduction in embodied carbon compared with standard 
concrete for new U.S. data centers, and we are expanding 
this requirement globally. Also, instead of using steel from 
oxygen furnaces that burn coal or gas, we are moving to 
steel from electric-arc furnaces, which use scrap steel and 
can create steel using renewable energy and up to 100% 
recycled content. In 2021, six AWS data centers were 
constructed with steel made this way, and we have plans  
to build more in the future.

Decarbonizing the Supply Chain
Amazon utilizes an extensive supply chain to deliver goods 
and services to our customers. Our carbon accounting 
process addresses all three Scopes of emissions under the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Since 2019, we have shared the 
Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions included in our footprint through 
our annual Sustainability Report, along with a detailed 
description of the comprehensive methodology underlying 
our calculations. 
Measurement is critical as we work toward our goal of net-
zero carbon by 2040—we have to measure and understand 
emissions in order to eliminate them. Like other companies, 
we are working to improve the granularity of data available 
and will continue to seek improvements to our reporting 
processes. We already work with organizations and 
regulatory bodies around the globe to promote transparent 
and comparable climate reporting.
One example of this is through our partnership with the 
We Mean Business Coalition, a group of nonprofits focused 
on accelerating the transition to a net-zero economy. We 
support the Coalition’s SME Climate Hub—a global initiative 
that gives small and medium-sized enterprises, like those 
in our supply chain, free tools and resources to measure 
and report their emissions. With the Hub’s support, these 
companies are committing to halve their emissions by 2030 
and to reach net-zero by 2050. We Thrive on Big Challenges
The challenges we collectively face on the path to net-zero 
carbon are considerable. Many new technologies are  
showing promise in their ability to reduce carbon emissions, 
but may still require significant development. We need to 
both invent new solutions and scale and drive down the 
costs of known solutions. 
In 2021, we reached 85% renewable energy across our 
operations, and we are on a path to achieve 100% by 
2025—five years ahead of the original target of 2030. 
Progress is not easy, and we are far from done. However, 
our success in deploying renewable energy globally provides 
us with a playbook that we are deploying to tackle big 
challenges like transportation, building construction, and 
supply chain decarbonization strategies. With our relentless 
culture of innovation, and a tenacious team of sustainability 
scientists and professionals, we are committed to reaching 
our 2040 target. 
But we can’t do it alone. We will continue to work with 
partners in the public and private sectors to drive innovation, 
technology advancements, and global policy change. To the 
public sector, we say: We support and encourage policies 
and public-private partnerships that will help accelerate 
climate solutions. And as one of more than 300 signatories 
to The Climate Pledge, we say to the innovators, scientists, 
builders, and entrepreneurs: Our door is open. We all need to 
decarbonize. The work may not make the headlines or bring 
immediate rewards, but a challenge like this will never be 
resolved overnight. These are the hard steps that need to be 
taken. We welcome you to join us in finding solutions to this 
global crisis.

Industries Growing The 
Climate Pledge
The Climate Pledge is a commitment 
to reach net-zero carbon emissions 
by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris 
Agreement. Amazon co-founded 
The Climate Pledge in 2019 to 
build a cross-sector community 
of companies, organizations, 
individuals, and partners working 
together to address the climate 
crisis and solve the challenges of 
decarbonizing our economy.Our Approach 
Joining The Climate Pledge is an opportunity for companies 
to be part of a community committed to transformational 
action to protect the environment from the disruptive 
risks associated with climate change. Signatories commit 
to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and play a 
critical role in stimulating investment in the development 
of low-carbon products and services.
Amazon became the first company to sign The Climate 
Pledge after co-founding the initiative with Global Optimism, 
a purpose-driven organization led by Christiana Figueres and 
Tom Rivett-Carnac, who oversaw the delivery of the historic 
Paris Agreement, the first global accord on climate change. 
The Climate Pledge joins leading organizations like the We 
Mean Business Coalition, Race to Zero, TED Countdown, 
and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to provide 
resources and support to mobilize the private sector to 
reach net-zero carbon by 2040. The Pledge Commitments
Signatories of The Climate Pledge agree to three areas 
of action:
Regular Reporting: Measure and report greenhouse gas 
emissions on a regular basis.
Carbon Elimination: Implement decarbonization strategies 
in line with the Paris Agreement through real business 
changes and innovations, including efficiency improvements, 
renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon-
emission-elimination strategies.
Credible Offsets: Neutralize any remaining emissions with 
additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial 
offsets to achieve net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.

Putting Principles Into Practice 
The power of The Climate Pledge is bringing companies together 
to accelerate action—and that’s just what happened with Climate 
Pledge Arena . Oak View Group , the Seattle Kraken , and 
Amazon—all signatories of The Climate Pledge—worked together 
to build the most sustainable arena in the world.
Named by Amazon and opened in 2021, Seattle’s history-making 
Climate Pledge Arena embodies the spirit of the Pledge and 
aims to set a new sustainability bar for the sports and events 
industry. In November 2020, the arena submitted its net-zero 
carbon registration to the International Living Future Institute. 
If certification is achieved, Climate Pledge Arena will be the first 
net-zero carbon certified arena in the world.
Renewable electricity from on-site solar panels and off-site 
renewable energy powers 100% of the arena’s operations. 
The stadium uses reclaimed rainwater stored in the ice rink 
system, a concept called “Rain to Rink,” to create the greenest 
ice in the National Hockey League (NHL). The building itself is 
also a feat; the original 44-million-pound roof from the previous 
Key Arena was reused in the construction to significantly reduce 
the embodied carbon of the new arena.
The arena is also aiming to divert over 97% of waste and eliminate 
100% of single-use plastics by 2024. As for the guest experience, 
at least 75% of the ingredients of food served in the arena will 
be sourced within a 300-mile radius and on a seasonal basis to 
support regional farmers and producers. All viable unused food 
from events will be donated to local community food programs.
The arena stands as a living example of what’s possible in the 
transition to a low-carbon economy. It’s not about giving up things 
we love—it’s about using innovation, technology, and great design 
to do them better than before.

Investments in 2021 
In 2021, Amazon invested in the following companies and 
initiatives to accelerate sustainability progress across the 
areas of transportation, aviation, freight, packaging, farming, 
and technology:
Amogy  is developing a system to convert green ammonia 
to power that will be emission-free at the point of use. With 
the potential to become one of the first scalable ammonia-
to-power systems, Amogy’s technology carries enough 
energy density to support long-distance transportation 
such as cargo shipping. This would be a significant step in 
helping decarbonize the main transport mode for global 
trade. Amogy’s technology also has future implications for 
Amazon’s own decarbonization goals, including those set 
by The Climate Pledge.Investing in 
Innovation 
Through 
The Climate 
Pledge Fund
We know that substantial 
investment is needed to develop 
solutions that will facilitate 
the transition to a low-carbon 
economy. The Climate Pledge 
Fund is a $2 billion venture 
investment program supporting 
the development of sustainable 
technologies and services that will 
enable Amazon to meet our net-
zero carbon goal. As of the end 
of 2021, Amazon had invested 
in 13 companies across multiple 
industry sectors since launching 
this fund in 2020.BETA Technologies  is reshaping air transportation with 
an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. 
This aircraft, called the ALIA, can carry three cargo pallets, 
or up to six people, for zero operational emissions delivery 
of cargo, medical supplies, or passengers. Amazon’s 
investment in BETA Technologies advances our path to 
zero-emissions package delivery and builds on our previous 
investment in ZeroAvia, the developers of hydrogen-electric 
aviation solutions.Hippo Harvest  is an agricultural company using plant 
science, machine learning, and robotics to grow leafy greens 
and other produce in greenhouse environments. Hippo 
Harvest’s technology addresses the emissions and waste 
that result from traditional produce farming. These include 
fertilizer and land use, transportation, and landfill methane 
from wasted produce, which account for roughly 30% of 
the emissions from crops grown for human consumption. 
The greenhouse system can be deployed almost anywhere, 
allowing produce to be grown closer to consumers. This cuts 
down emissions from produce transportation and increases 
the shelf life of fresh produce by up to five days. As a grocery 
retailer, Amazon is committed to supporting new produce 
solutions like those offered by Hippo Harvest as we grow 
our product offerings at our Amazon Fresh and Whole 
Foods Market stores.
CMC Machinery  designs and manufactures custom-sized 
boxes tailored to the dimensions of the items in each order. 
This technology lowers or removes the need for single-use 
plastic padding while still protecting items during shipping. 
Amazon expects that by the end of 2022, this technology 
could reduce the cubic volume of the boxes we use for 
package deliveries by 24% on average, and the technology 
is projected to reduce our use of approximately 1 billion 
plastic air pillows by the end of 2022.

Infinium  is a renewable electrofuels solution provider that 
focuses on converting captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen 
feedstocks into net-zero carbon fuels for use in today’s air 
transport, marine freight, and heavy truck fleets. Infinium 
electrofuels have the potential to enable organizations 
to meet their carbon-reduction goals by accelerating the 
transition away from fossil fuels.Resilient Power (RP)  builds efficient and effective 
transformer-based EV charging technology. RP’s technology 
enables EV fast-charging infrastructure to be built at one-
tenth the size and installation time of traditional charging 
technology, and is capable of charging up to 24 vehicles at a 
time without requiring expensive distribution grid upgrades. 
RP’s technology has the potential to help Amazon meet our 
goal of deploying 100,000 Rivian electric vans by 2030, by 
ensuring that vehicles can be quickly recharged to support 
delivery of customer packages.

Supporting 
Nature-Based 
Solutions
Climate science is telling us 
that, even with aggressive 
decarbonization efforts, companies 
will need to go beyond their 
own operations to reach net-
zero emissions by 2050. We 
believe that companies, including 
Amazon, can drastically reduce 
their own emissions while also 
investing outside their operations 
in initiatives that significantly 
contribute to achieving the Paris 
Agreement. One way we are doing 
this is by investing in nature-based 
solutions that conserve, restore, and 
improve land management activities 
to increase carbon storage in a 
variety of habitats.Our Approach
In 2019, Amazon created the Right Now Climate Fund, a 
$100 million fund for nature-based solutions to restore and 
conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. 
Amazon uses nature-based solutions to mitigate carbon 
emissions outside of our value chain and supplement the 
carbon-reduction efforts we are driving across our operations. 
Nature-based solutions also have the additional benefit of 
helping to preserve the natural world by conserving wildlife 
habitats, protecting biodiversity, improving water quality, and 
reducing flood risk. All of these impacts can greatly enhance 
well-being in communities around the world.
We follow scientific research to fund initiatives that are critical 
to hitting the targets of the Paris Agreement and staving 
off the most catastrophic effects of climate change. Our 
approach to carbon neutralization focuses on three actions 
outside our value chain that can deliver needed mitigation 
and that have a significant unmet need for investment: 
• Reducing deforestation to near zero, especially in 
tropical regions
• Scaling up the removal of carbon from the atmosphere 
with nature-based solutions such as reforestation 
and agroforestry
• Scaling up carbon-removal technologies, such as direct 
air carbon capture and storage
Scaling Up Nature-Based 
Carbon Removal
Nature-based carbon removal has the potential to take 
billions of tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. 
Our nature-based carbon removal actions center on 
developing systems, tools, scientific knowledge, and scalable business models for reforestation and regenerative 
agroforestry. Over time, we will look to expand our focus to 
include other forms of nature-based carbon removal, such 
as restoring mangrove forests and marine ecosystems.
Nature-Based Carbon Removal in Brazil
In 2021, Amazon partnered with The Nature Conservancy 
to launch the Agroforestry and Restoration Accelerator . 
The Accelerator will restore native rainforest to naturally trap 
and store carbon and mitigate climate change. It will also 
create a more sustainable source of income for thousands of 
local farmers in the Brazilian Amazonian state of Pará. The 
Accelerator is experimenting with innovative ways to support 
farmers and nurture markets for sustainable commodities 
and will advance new approaches and satellite-based 
technologies to quantify and monitor carbon removal.
Reducing Emissions From 
Deforestation
Significant investment is urgently needed to help 
communities set a course that both provides for sustainable 
economic development and protects forests, particularly in 
tropical forest regions.
Protecting the World’s Tropical Rainforests 
In 2021, Amazon helped to create the Lowering Emissions 
by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition , a global 
initiative of governments and leading companies that has 
already mobilized $1 billion to protect the world’s tropical 
rainforests . The public-private project is designed to 
accelerate climate action by providing financing to help 
countries protect their tropical rainforests. In November 
2021, the coalition signed Letters of Intent with five tropical 
forest countries: Ecuador, Costa Rica, Ghana, Vietnam, and Nepal. The LEAF Coalition is expected to become one of the 
largest initiatives ever to protect tropical forests and support 
sustainable development, and will benefit billions of people 
around the world who depend on the rainforests.
Supporting Family Forests in the U.S. 
In 2020, Amazon committed $10 million to support two 
programs in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy. 
The programs help family forest owners sequester carbon 
across the Appalachian region of the Eastern U.S., which 
has been identified as disproportionately important for 
conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. 
Amazon’s grant supports efforts to expand the programs 
to new regions, develop a scientific approach to measuring 
regional carbon impact, and enhance carbon verification 
methodology for these projects. In 2021, the programs 
added 107 new family landowners and expanded access 
to the program to 130 counties.

Nature-Based Investments in 
Communities Across Europe
Nature can transform urban communities while also mitigating 
some of the effects of climate change, like urban heat, 
flooding, and biodiversity loss. Therefore, in addition to 
our work and funding toward large-scale carbon emissions 
mitigation through nature-based solutions, we are also 
funding smaller-scale nature projects in the communities 
where we operate. 
As part of our Right Now Climate Fund, Amazon has 
committed €20 million  toward nature-based projects in 
communities across Europe. These projects will have robust, 
science-based environmental benefits for carbon removal 
and biodiversity, along with social benefits such as job 
creation and access to nature.
Promoting Reforestation in Italy 
In 2021, Amazon committed €2 million to support Parco 
Italia, an urban forestry program that aims to plant 
22 million trees across 14 metropolitan areas in Italy. This 
translates to one tree planted per city resident. Amazon’s 
support for this project will help cities become more resilient 
to climate change by increasing urban biodiversity, improving 
air quality, and promoting urban cooling.Urban Greening in Germany 
In 2020, Amazon committed €3.75 million to The Nature 
Conservancy’s Urban Greening Program in Germany, which 
promotes biodiversity, reduces urban heat islands, and 
improves stormwater management in the face of climate 
change. With Amazon’s support, the program launched 
in Berlin’s Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district in 2020. 
In 2021, the Urban Greening Program developed mapping 
and analysis for roofs, grasslands, and urban streetscapes 
for greening potential.

On the Path to 
100% Renewable 
Energy
Transitioning to renewable energy 
is one of the highest-impact ways to 
immediately lower emissions. With 
274 renewable projects announced 
as of the end of 2021, Amazon is the 
world’s largest corporate purchaser 
of renewable energy and is on a 
path to powering our operations 
with 100% renewable energy by 
2025—five years ahead of our 
original target of 2030.Our Approach
Since 2014, Amazon has invested in global renewable 
energy generation to decarbonize our business across our 
worldwide operations. We procure new renewable energy 
through contracts for utility-scale wind and solar, on-site 
rooftop solar installations, and green tariffs with local utilities 
that deliver new, renewable energy to the grids where 
we operate.
Our projects supply renewable energy for a variety of 
Amazon facilities, including corporate offices, fulfillment 
centers, data centers, and physical stores, which collectively 
serve millions of customers globally. These projects also help 
meet Amazon’s commitment to produce the clean energy 
equivalent of the electricity used by every customer’s Echo 
device. We are making additional large-scale investments in 
wind and solar farm capacity, which will produce the clean 
energy equivalent to the electricity used by all Echo, Fire TV, 
and Ring devices worldwide by 2025.
Our Journey
In 2021, we reached 85% renewable energy across our 
business, with more than 12 gigawatts (GW) of renewable 
energy production capacity across our global portfolio. 
Once these projects are fully operational, they are expected 
to deliver up to 33,700 gigawatt-hours of energy annually—
the electricity output equivalent to powering more than 
3 million U.S. homes for one year.
These projects helped power more than 30 million 
megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity used by Amazon in 
2021 and led to a 23% reduction in our carbon emissions 
from purchased electricity from 2020 to 2021. In 2021, we expanded our renewable energy footprint into 
new geographies, and by the end of the year, announced 
renewable energy projects across 18 countries. Our first solar 
projects in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates came 
online, and we announced new projects in Singapore, Japan, 
Australia, and China. Our projects in South Africa and Japan 
are the first corporate-backed, utility-scale solar farms in 
these countries.

South Africa  started to supply clean, renewable 
energy to the grid that powers AWS data centers, 
contributing to the country’s 2030 renewable 
energy goals. Located in the Northern Cape 
province, the 10-megawatt (MW) solar project 
is expected to generate up to 28,000 MWh of 
renewable energy per year, which is equivalent to 
the annual electricity consumption of over 8,000 
average South African homes. 
The solar project consists of more than 24,000 
solar panels that track the sun from east to west, 
rotating on a single point. Altogether, the project 
covers an area of 20 hectares in the Northern 
Cape, where sunlight is an abundant resource. 
The project’s design will avoid an estimated 
25,000 tons of carbon emissions annually, the 
equivalent of removing 5,400 cars from the road 
in South Africa.
The solar project is majority-owned by local 
women and operated by a fully South African-
owned company. The project has reduced waste 
by donating unused materials from construction, 
including pallets and electrical cable drums, to 
local furniture businesses and special skills schools 
to support small and medium-sized businesses.Energy Storage Solutions
Keeping the power grid supplied when the sun isn’t shining 
and the wind isn’t blowing demands innovative solutions to 
continually generate carbon-free electricity. In 2021, Amazon 
announced our first solar energy and storage projects ,  
which provide the infrastructure required to store solar 
energy generated when the sun is shining. These utility-scale 
projects help enable electricity grids to operate with carbon-
free electricity when the sun isn’t shining. 
Making the Grid Greener Through 
Renewable Energy Optimization
As our use of renewable energy grows, we monitor the 
operational performance of hundreds of global projects to 
help us achieve our renewable energy goals. We employ a 
team dedicated to renewable energy optimization (REO) ,  
which leverages AWS Cloud technology to improve the 
performance of Amazon’s portfolio of wind and solar 
projects. Our REO team developed an end-to-end solution 
using AWS services to perform near real-time monitoring of 
our renewable energy projects. The team used AWS Internet 
of Things-based architecture to create a highly secure, 
reliable, scalable, and low-cost solution that manages data 
from hundreds of renewable energy projects. This enables 
us to rapidly identify and troubleshoot inefficiencies and find 
more opportunities for greater impact. 
By 2025, we expect these optimizations will deliver the 
same amount of additional clean energy as a new 150-MW 
wind farm. 24K+

Incorporating 
Sustainability 
Into Our Buildings
Amazon operates thousands of 
world-class facilities that serve our 
global employees, customers, and 
communities. We strive to reduce 
the environmental impacts of our 
buildings while creating a positive 
experience for the people who 
occupy them.Our Approach
We leverage industry best practices and emerging 
technologies in facility design and operation to drive 
reductions across carbon, energy, water, and waste. We 
focus on the direct emissions that result from powering 
our buildings, as well as the indirect emissions from 
the embodied carbon—the carbon emitted during 
construction—in our building materials and equipment. 
We use proven technologies to enhance efficiency across 
our facilities and pilot new ideas, including innovations 
supported by The Climate Pledge Fund, to transition our 
buildings to net-zero carbon. In Corporate Offices
We use innovative design to build sustainability into our 
physical campuses. Energy-efficient lighting, low-flow 
water fixtures, composting, and recycling are common 
features in our corporate offices. Many of our office 
buildings offer plazas and open green spaces for public 
use, along with green roofs that provide outdoor amenity 
space while supporting ecological functions like stormwater 
management. We also offer plug-in electric vehicle (EV) 
charging stations and bicycle parking to encourage low-
carbon transportation for employees and visitors. 
In 2021, we unveiled our latest plans for sustainable design 
enhancements at PenPlace , the second phase of our 
HQ2 development in Virginia. From the start, sustainability 
has been a key element of our HQ2 campus and we 
are committed to achieving Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification, the 
highest sustainability certification for a development issued 
by the U.S. Green Building Council. 
Once completed, we aim for PenPlace to achieve a  
minimum of:
• 10% reduction in the amount of embodied carbon 
compared to typical construction practices, followed 
by a commitment to offset 100% of the remaining 
embodied carbon.
• 50% reduction in water consumption beyond national 
standards, using low-flow fixtures and reclaimed water.
• 30% energy savings below the American Society of Heating, 
Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 
baseline, with electrified building systems powered by 100% 
renewable energy through a combination of both on-site 
solar and local off-site solar generation.Informed by an active and ongoing engagement process with 
Arlington County, we are reintroducing native plant species 
and creating a green, walkable, safe, and enjoyable community 
park for employees, nearby residents, and visitors. We are also 
expanding the planted area by 5,500 square feet, bringing the 
total area of public space at PenPlace to 2.5 acres.
In addition, we are making it easier for pedestrians and 
cyclists to navigate the campus. Protected bike lanes connect 
PenPlace to the comprehensive local bike transit plan, 
ensuring our presence helps push forward Arlington’s own 
sustainability ambitions.
In Fulfillment Facilities 
Our fulfillment facilities  are state-of-the-art warehouses 
where we process orders for our customers. In 2021, we 
conducted pilot projects at several new fulfillment facilities 
using a low-carbon concrete technology produced by 
CarbonCure, a company Amazon has invested in through The 
Climate Pledge Fund. CarbonCure’s technology enables the 
concrete industry to sequester carbon permanently in fresh 
concrete, reducing embodied carbon at new construction sites.
We also launched pilot projects at fulfillment facilities in 
North America to improve our on-site water management. 
This involved retrofitting sites to divert excess water runoff 
away from stormwater drains and toward ponds that exist 
on each facility’s property. 
In addition, many of our fulfillment facilities throughout 
the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, 
where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of the 
facility’s energy use. As of 2021, 115 of our global fulfillment 
facilities have rooftop solar installations and we continue to 
scale this program globally.

In Our Stores
Sustainable building design is also important in our physical 
stores. In early 2022, our Amazon Fresh location in Seattle, 
Washington, became the world’s first grocery store to pursue 
Zero Carbon Certification  from the International Living 
Future Institute, a leading nonprofit dedicated to advancing 
sustainable building practices. 
More than a dozen upgrades were incorporated throughout 
the development of the store, including transitioning to a 
CO2-based refrigeration system that reduces greenhouse 
gas emissions by 38 metric tons per year compared to a 
conventional system. The store also uses steel byproducts 
in the concrete floor to reduce embodied carbon by nearly 
40% compared to a standard concrete floor.
Other key features include a fully electric kitchen space 
that reduces the need for fossil fuel combustion in the 
store, electrifying the store using 100% renewable 
electricity sourced from Amazon’s renewable energy 
projects, incorporation of low-flow fixtures in restrooms 
and kitchens to reduce water use, and free EV charging 
for customers. As a result of these upgrades, we expect 
the store will save nearly 185 tons of CO 2e each year—the 
equivalent of driving around the Earth 18 times in a standard 
passenger vehicle.1 
Our Whole Foods Market stores feature similar sustainability 
benefits and upgrades. At the end of 2021, 200 EV charging 
stations were available in Whole Foods Market parking lots 
throughout the U.S. Nearly 50 Whole Foods Market stores 
utilized refrigeration systems that rely on natural refrigerants 
with low global warming potentials and over 70 Whole 
Foods Market stores had solar rooftops.Amazon Sustainability Ambassadors 
Sustainability Ambassadors are sustainability-
minded Amazon employees who work to amplify 
global, companywide efforts at the local level. 
Ambassadors lead projects on Amazon campuses 
and create virtual engagement opportunities to 
inspire fellow employees, both at work and at home. 
The program also serves as a community for sharing 
best practices among teams in different settings 
and locations.
Since launching in 2018, the Sustainability 
Ambassador program has transformed into a 
collaborative network across 1,250 global locations. 
As of 2021, more than 8,900 Amazon employees 
participate in the program—up from 7,500 in 
2020. In 2021, we launched new chapters in India, 
Brazil, Australia, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, 
and beyond.
Driving Local Impact, Globally 
Ambassadors who work at physical sites, like 
fulfillment centers, focus on opportunities to 
engage fellow employees through on-site initiatives. 
In 2021, Ambassadors at a facility in Wisconsin 
partnered with a local waste vendor to install 
recycling stations for employees to deposit used 
electronics. In Italy, an Ambassador spearheaded 
an effort to include sustainability information in 
new hire orientation programming for thousands of new Amazon employees. In Tennessee, more 
than 35 Ambassadors hosted an event at a nearby 
middle school to plant a total of 44 trees that will 
help sequester carbon and divert stormwater at 
the school campus. Ambassadors in Singapore also 
led a tree-planting event to support the Singapore 
Botanic Gardens.
Ambassadors in our corporate offices are focused on 
sustainability initiatives that can be done virtually in 
any setting. In 2021, 5,600 Ambassadors across the 
globe participated in the Four-Week Sustainability 
Challenge, picking up litter or eating plant-based 
foods, among other everyday actions that help 
promote a more sustainable lifestyle. As part of 
the challenge, a group of participants in Europe 
collected more than 2,500 pieces of plastic waste 
in just 15 days.
For the second year in a row, Sustainability 
Ambassadors led Amazon’s Sustainability Summit, a 
virtual educational event available to all employees 
to learn more about our corporate sustainability 
programs and partnerships. The event drew 13,000 
registrations across 23 virtual sessions in 2021 and 
featured speakers from Amazon’s sustainability 
leadership team, Sustainability Ambassador 
chapters, and signatories of The Climate Pledge. 
The summit also featured our second crowdsourcing 
challenge for Amazon employees to present 
innovative ideas on sustainability, which received 
89 submissions.

Decarbonizing 
Transportation
Delivering for our global customers 
requires Amazon to rely on a variety 
of transportation solutions for long 
and short distances. Decarbonizing 
our transportation network is a 
key part of meeting The Climate 
Pledge by 2040 and making 50% 
of Amazon shipments net-zero 
carbon by 2030, which is why 
we are actively transforming our 
fleet network and operations.Our Approach
One of the ways we are decarbonizing our transportation 
network is by deploying technical solutions including zero-
emission vehicles and low-carbon fuels. We are preparing 
our systems and facilities to accommodate the large-
scale adoption of zero-emission vehicles in the coming 
years, which will require new refueling infrastructure and 
operating patterns. 
Achieving our net-zero carbon goal will also demand long-
term solutions that have not yet been invented, along with 
an abundant supply of clean energy sources to power those 
technologies. Knowing this, we are investing in breakthrough 
innovations through The Climate Pledge Fund and forging 
industry partnerships to accelerate change. 
Deploying Solutions Across 
Our Network
Last-Mile Delivery
We use a range of delivery methods to reduce emissions on 
last-mile routes to our customers’ doorsteps. These include 
electric delivery vehicles and micromobility technologies that 
can be used for shorter journeys. 
In 2019, we ordered 100,000 custom electric delivery 
vehicles from Rivian—the largest order ever of electric 
delivery vehicles. We rolled out the first of these vehicles 
in 2021. We expanded our European electric delivery fleet 
with an order for 1,800 electric vans from Mercedes-Benz, 
a signatory of The Climate Pledge. In India, we are adding 
10,000 electric vehicles (EVs) to our existing fleet, including 
two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and four-wheeler vehicles built 
by local manufacturers. We are also piloting electric delivery 
vehicles in other locations, including Latin America, Asia, and 
the Middle East.In 2021, more than 100 million packages were delivered to 
our customers’ doorsteps across Europe with a fleet of over 
3,000 electric delivery vans and other zero-emission vehicles. 
Additionally, over half a million packages were delivered to 
our customers’ doorsteps in North America with EVs. More 
than 100 Amazon delivery stations across North America 
and Europe are equipped for EV usage, and all new delivery 
stations are designed to meet the needs of our current and 
future electric delivery fleets.
Zero-Emission Transportation in Paris
We announced in November 2021 that, in the city of Paris, 
two-thirds of our shipments are delivered using zero-emission 
transportation. This was achieved through a combination of EVs, 
cargo bikes, and carts for deliveries on foot through our Delivery 
Service Partners—all of which contribute to decarbonizing the 
last-mile delivery process.Additionally, we are using micromobility technologies to 
transform the way packages are delivered, particularly in 
urban settings. In 2021, more than 5 million shipments across 
17 European cities and 30 million packages in Manhattan, 
New York, were delivered to our customers’ doorsteps using 
cargo bikes and walkers. Our global bicycle fleet includes 
traditional bicycles and electric bikes connected to cargo 
trailers that can carry up to 45 packages at a time. More than 
400 cargo bikes are used to make deliveries for Whole Foods 
Market and Amazon Fresh to customers in Manhattan and 
Brooklyn in New York City.

We also purchased sustainable fuel made from waste 
cooking oil to reduce shipping emissions in ocean shipping. 
This purchase was estimated to have reduced emissions by 
approximately 20,000 metric tons of CO 2e in 2021, which 
will be continued in 2022. We continue to advance public 
policies at the national and multinational levels that will 
support the decarbonization of the maritime shipping sector.
Partnering to Support Solutions of 
the Future
We know that moving to more-sustainable transportation 
will require innovative solutions and sustainable fuels that 
do not yet exist. Through The Climate Pledge Fund ,  
we are helping inventors and entrepreneurs move faster 
with an investment portfolio that includes breakthrough 
transportation technologies, such as those being developed 
by Rivian, BETA Technologies, Resilient Power, Amogy, 
Infinium, and ZeroAvia. 
In 2021, we helped launch  Cargo Owners for Zero 
Emission Vessels (coZEV) with the Aspen Institute. Through 
coZEV, Amazon is supporting initiatives to increase the 
availability of zero-emission technologies and fuels while 
gaining support from shipping lines, cargo owners, ports, and 
other organizations that can enable energy transition. We 
also became a founding private sector member of the First 
Movers Coalition to lead decarbonization of the maritime 
shipping industry. The coalition brings global companies 
together to harness their purchasing power and supply 
chains to create early markets for innovative clean energy 
technologies that are key for tackling the climate crisis. With 
this launch, we announced our commitment to use ships with 
zero-emission fuels for at least 10% of the volume of our 
goods shipped internationally by 2030 and 100% by 2040. Additionally, we are driving policies that support the adoption 
of green technology around the world. In May 2021, we 
supported a policy proposal to the Japanese government for 
the adoption of zero-emission vehicles in the delivery industry 
by the Japan Climate Leaders’ Partnership . The government 
set a new target of 100% electric or fuel cell vehicles in new 
delivery vehicle sales by 2040. It also introduced intensive 
measures to adopt EVs over the next decade through the 
Green Growth Strategy  in June 2021. 
Amazon FASTforward
Amazon works with thousands of external transportation 
providers, from individual truck owners to multinational 
logistics service companies. As part of our work to 
decarbonize our transportation network, we want to 
make clean technologies available and accessible to all 
of them. In 2021, we held our first virtual transportation 
sustainability summit , FASTforward, focused on Future 
Advanced Sustainable Transportation. The summit 
brought together industry leaders, fleet operators and 
manufacturers, researchers, and policy experts from 
Europe to share experiences and inspire action.Middle-Mile and Long-
Distance Transportation
When it comes to transporting goods over longer distances, 
we rely on transportation across roads, rail, air, and water, 
each of which offers few existing low-carbon solutions that 
can be immediately deployed at scale. We are promoting 
the use of low-carbon solutions in the near term while also 
investing in emerging technologies and collaborating with 
others to accelerate cross-sector innovation in middle-mile 
and long-distance transportation for the future.
In North America and Europe, we increased our total rail load 
volume and expanded our Amazon and leased rail assets 
in 2021. We started deploying battery EV trucks across our 
heavy commercial trucking fleets and began switching to 
vehicles that use alternative fuel sources, like compressed 
natural gas (CNG) trucks. As of 2021, we had ordered more 
than 3,000 CNG vehicles, and we are procuring millions of 
gallons of renewable natural gas created from waste stocks 
to power them, significantly reducing carbon emissions and 
particulate matter pollutants.
We are investing in alternative fuels, such as sustainable 
aviation fuel, which reduces carbon emissions in flight up 
to 20% over standard aviation fuel. Amazon secured more 
than 5 million gallons of low-carbon aviation fuel in 2020 
and agreed to purchase up to 6.5 million gallons in 2021 
and 2022. We also joined the Sustainable Aviation Buyers 
Alliance  in 2021 and became one of the group’s founding 
members to drive investment and send market signals in 
support of sustainable aviation fuel. “  By joining the First Movers Coalition, we 
are sending a clear signal that companies 
like Amazon are seeking long-term, 
low-carbon fuel solutions to help us 
achieve net-zero carbon by 2040. We 
welcome the Biden administration and 
the World Economic Forum’s decision to 
launch the First Movers Coalition, which 
will help further accelerate our efforts 
to decarbonize our operations through 
real business change and innovation.”

Avoiding and 
Managing Waste
Beyond Amazon’s commitment to 
decarbonize our operations, we 
are working to send less material 
to landfills and more back into 
the circular economy loop. The 
majority of the waste we produce 
comes through our customer 
fulfillment operations, from 
materials that become obsolete in 
our supply chain, or from surplus 
inventory, including items that are 
overstocked, returned, cosmetically 
damaged, or near expiration. Our Approach
The best way to reduce waste is to avoid creating it in 
the first place, through waste-prevention programs and 
optimized inventory management. Reuse is the next 
best option, and is achieved by repairing, repurposing, 
and donating usable items—all actions we’ve developed 
programs to support. We then rely on recycling and 
composting to enable the recovery of raw materials,  
and as a last resort, we seek to recover energy from  
any waste material that must be sent to landfill. 
Reimagining the Product Lifecycle 
Through Amazon Second Chance 
Through Amazon Second Chance , we provide customers 
with ways to responsibly retire their products. Customers in 
the U.S., UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, 
and Japan can access a range of services to recycle, repair, 
or trade in their items, as well as shop for like-new and 
refurbished products. We also provide guidance on the 
responsible disposal of Amazon packaging.   How to shop pre-owned items:
Amazon Renewed  offers refurbished products such as 
electronics, home appliances, and more. All products are 
professionally inspected and tested to work and look like 
new and are backed by the Amazon Renewed Guarantee.
Amazon Warehouse  gives a second life to products 
returned by customers. Each product undergoes a rigorous 
20-point inspection process before being sold at a discount.
Pre-Owned Amazon Devices  provides customers with 
access to certified refurbished, like-new Amazon devices 
that have been screened and tested by Amazon and are 
backed with the same limited warranty as a new device. 
 
  How to recycle or trade in products: 
Amazon Trade-In  allows customers in the U.S., UK, and 
Germany to trade in thousands of eligible electronics, such 
as Amazon devices and select third-party cell phones, tablets, video games and consoles, Bluetooth devices, and 
more, in exchange for an Amazon Gift Card. Traded-in 
Amazon devices are processed and resold to new owners, 
and any devices not qualified for resale are recycled through 
an Amazon-approved recycler.
For electronic equipment that cannot be repaired or traded 
in, customers can recycle their items free of charge through 
Amazon Device Recycling  in the U.S. and through various 
recycling initiatives  in Europe. These programs route 
electronic equipment to recycling partners and verify that 
they are recycled and repurposed. 
  How to repair items: 
Free product support  provides customers with technical 
assistance for select items, encouraging customers to fix 
items and maximize their lifespan before replacing or 
disposing of them. In the U.S., repair support is also available 
through iFixit .
2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix 26  
Avoiding Waste Through 
Product Donations
At our global fulfillment centers, we use software to 
identify and sort eligible items that are fit for donation. 
We partner with local community organizations to collect 
these items from Amazon facilities and distribute them to 
people in need. By donating surplus inventory to charitable 
organizations, we keep usable products out of the waste 
stream and help strengthen our local communities.
Many of our product donations are generated through our 
Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) donations program, which 
automates the process for Amazon selling partners to donate 
their overstocked or returned items. The service requires no 
additional action from selling partners, allowing Amazon to 
easily scale product donations through our existing logistics. 
We distribute the majority of our product donations through 
Good360, a nonprofit that works with a network of 100,000 
charity partners in the U.S. Through our partnership with 
Good360, Amazon product donations are distributed to low-
income households, foster families, individuals with special 
needs or disabilities, seniors, veterans, immigrants, and more. 
In Europe, we partner directly with more than 100 charities 
and local organizations to distribute product donations. 
Since 2019, Amazon has contributed more than 100 million 
products to our global charity partners in North America, 
Europe, Australia, and Japan. We are continuing to expand 
our product donations program globally by adding new 
locations in the Middle East, North Africa, and South America.
Redirecting Food Waste
As an online food retailer and an operator of physical grocery 
stores, Amazon is committed to reducing our food waste by 50% across our U.S. and Europe operations by 2030. 
We became a member of the Food Loss and Waste 2030 
Champions  through the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency in 2020, and extended our commitment to reducing 
food waste to our Europe operations in 2021. To achieve 
this, we are optimizing our food inventory management 
systems to minimize waste from the outset and prioritizing 
ways to avoid landfills.
Wherever possible, we donate surplus food to individuals and 
families who need it most through community redistribution 
programs. In 2021, we donated 85 million pounds of 
food—equivalent to more than 70 million meals—through 
Feeding America in the U.S. Feeding America is a network 
of food banks, pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other 
community-based agencies that helps Amazon maximize the 
impact of our food donations. In Europe, we donated more 
than 4,000 tons of food—equivalent to 10 million meals—in 2021. All of our UK grocery stores have a donation  
partner in place that helps deliver surplus food to charities 
around London. Similarly, all of our U.S. grocery stores have 
a donation partner. 
For food that can’t be donated, we turn to processes 
that avoid landfills, such as composting and anaerobic 
digestion. In 2021, we diverted 27,000 tons of food through 
composting and anaerobic digestion across our worldwide 
operations. All Amazon Fresh stores operating in the U.S. 
have composting programs for food that cannot be donated, 
and we are expanding our on-site composting capabilities 
across our facilities.
At our Whole Foods Market stores, we have active 
composting programs at nearly 470 locations and collectively 
diverted more than 155,000 tons of food waste by the 
end of 2021. Another 2,775 tons of food waste were sent to anaerobic digestion facilities through an organic waste 
recycling system called Grind2Energy. The Grind2Energy 
system has helped to divert 12,500 tons of food waste at 
Whole Foods Market stores since 2014. As a result, we have 
prevented nearly 9,000 metric tons of CO 2e from entering 
the atmosphere and produced enough clean, renewable 
energy to power over 2,500 U.S. homes for a month. 
Recycling Solutions Across 
Our Operations
Corrugated board is the most common material that 
flows through our fulfillment center operations, and we 
work with third-party recycling haulers to remove excess 
corrugate from our facilities for off-site recycling. Many 
of these haulers also supply Amazon with the packaging 
materials that we use for customer shipments, converting 
waste material recovered from Amazon operations into 
new, recycled packaging.
Not all the materials we use can be easily recycled with 
current systems, so we look for innovative solutions to 
recycle these challenging materials. One example is plastic 
film, which is not commonly accepted through municipal 
recycling programs. We have on-site plastic film recycling 
systems at many Amazon operations facilities across North 
America and Europe, enabling us to convert plastic film into 
bags made of 100% recycled material.
We continue to explore alternative solutions for other 
materials that are challenging to recycle. In 2021, we 
completed a pilot to recycle and repair damaged bags used to 
sort and stow items in our fulfillment operations into reusable 
materials. Additionally, we work with our shipping label 
suppliers in several European locations to recycle the silicone 
backing paper from shipping labels to make new ones. CityServe
CityServe, based in California, is one example 
of a Good360 Community Redistribution 
Partner; it works with a network of local 
churches to deliver necessities to thousands 
of individuals and families.
In 2021, our donations enabled CityServe 
to provide personal care supplies to more 
than 20,000 people. CityServe staff and 
volunteers assembled “blessing bags” full 
of items donated by Amazon, including 
toothpaste, toothbrushes, hand towels, and 
disposable masks. The bags were distributed 
to individuals and families without housing.

Improving Our 
Packaging 
Packaging plays a critical role in 
the customer delivery experience, 
and Amazon is committed to 
delivering products safely and 
sustainably. Since 2015, we have 
invested in materials, processes, 
and technologies that have reduced 
per-shipment packaging weight 
by 38% and eliminated over 
1.5 million tons of packaging.Our Approach
Amazon customers want right-sized, recyclable packaging 
that minimizes waste and ensures damage-free delivery. 
We work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging 
options using a science-based approach that combines 
lab testing, machine learning, materials science, and 
manufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change 
across the packaging supply chain.
Eliminating Packaging Where Possible
Frustration-Free Packaging (FFP)  is Amazon’s flagship 
program designed to reinvent the packaging experience. 
FFP products offer more-sustainable packaging that is 
easy to open, fully recyclable, and capable of shipping 
without additional packaging protection. In 2021, we began 
offering incentives to vendors that convert their packaging 
to FFP to encourage more vendors to adopt these best-in-
class standards. We also offer additional incentives when 
those changes include reductions in total cubic volume. 
This generates less packaging waste for customers and 
enables more packages per delivery vehicle. By the end 
of 2021, more than 2 million products qualified under 
our FFP programs. Partnering for Better Packaging
Some products are more difficult to ship than others. 
Stemware, for example, is fragile and frequently arrives 
with multiple layers of padding to prevent damage. This 
additional material can make for a frustrating customer 
experience and doesn’t always protect the product.
To demonstrate that e-commerce packaging can be 
both minimal and effective, we facilitated a complete 
redesign of stemware packaging for Lenox, a well-
known brand that has specialized in tableware and 
glassware for over 130 years. 
This novel packaging design includes changing product 
orientation to optimize for space. It also includes a 
protective corrugate insert, replacing the need for 
bubble wrap, further reducing plastic waste and 
improving the customer experience. The result is a fully 
recyclable package that uses 83% less material weight 
and 78% less volume without compromising protection 
of the item inside.Cold Groceries, Delivered 
More Sustainably 
In 2021, U.S. grocery teams launched new curbside-
recyclable packaging to replace nonrecyclable insulation 
that protects chilled items in grocery deliveries. This has 
eliminated the annual need for 1,500 tons of natural 
cotton fiber and 7,500 tons of nonrecyclable mixed 
plastic that was previously required to safely deliver 
chilled or frozen groceries from Amazon Fresh and 
Whole Foods Market.
It is particularly challenging to design new solutions 
that maintain adequate insulation properties to keep 
products chilled. Our innovative packaging uses layers 
of  tissue to provide both durability and insulation 
without sacrificing recyclability. 
Customers were with us for every step of this journey.
Learn more about how we tested this packaging in 
several U.S. cities and incorporated improvements into 
the design based on customer feedback .

Packaging Is Necessary
When additional Amazon packaging is required to ship a 
product, we strive to optimize that packaging for increased 
recyclability along with reduced waste and carbon. We are 
transitioning to materials that are compatible with local 
paper and plastic recycling streams where we operate. We 
also support initiatives to expand the availability of curbside 
recycling infrastructure to the public through investments in The 
Recycling Partnership and the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund. 
In the U.S., we expanded the use of our recyclable paper 
padded mailer, replacing nearly 70% of our mixed material 
bubble mailers in 2021. We also improved the composition 
of our single-use plastic packaging to use less material and 
incorporate more recycled content. In 2021, we increased the 
recycled content of our plastic film bags from 25% to 50% 
and that of our plastic padded bags from 15% to over 40%. 
Through these collective efforts, we avoided over 30,000 tons 
of plastic across North America in 2021.Algorithm Packaging Efficiencies
Our Fulfillment Packaging Breakdown in 2021when smaller products are suitable for flexible packaging, 
such as padded mailers and bags, which are up to 75% 
lighter than similar-sized boxes. Over the past five years, 
these algorithms have allowed us to reduce the use of 
corrugated boxes by over 35%.
In 2021, we deployed data-science algorithms to optimize 
the number and size of boxes used for 12 geographies 
around the world. These algorithms—which help our 
fulfillment centers maintain the right mix of box sizes— 
now cover 65% of global box shipments, with plans to  
scale to 97% in 2022.
We also introduced advanced fitting algorithms designed 
to reduce packaging specifically for shipments with 
multiple items. These new algorithms calculate the 
possible arrangements of products for best fit in a three-
dimensional virtual package. Since launch, this technology 
has downgraded the size or type of packaging for 7% of 
total  shipments and we plan to deploy it globally in 2022.In Europe, we switched from single-use plastic delivery bags 
to recyclable paper delivery bags and cardboard envelopes 
for orders shipped from fulfillment centers in 2021. We also 
removed a wide range of single-use plastic products from 
our European stores. In Australia, we replaced all single-use 
air pillows with 100% recyclable paper material to protect 
goods during shipping. Amazon also became a founding 
member of the India Plastics Pact after removing single-use, 
thin film plastics from Amazon packaging throughout India 
fulfillment centers in 2020. 
Using Technology to Optimize 
Packaging Type and Fit
We use a range of boxes and mailers across our fulfillment 
network, and for every shipment that requires packaging, we 
use science-based systems to determine optimal packaging 
sizes and types. This starts with using machine learning 
to identify products that can be delivered safely with less 
material. Machine learning algorithms help us determine

Product 
Sustainability
As part of our mission to be Earth’s 
most customer-centric company, 
we are giving customers access to 
products that are more sustainable. 
This includes both our Amazon-
branded products and the third-
party items we offer that feature 
sustainability certifications through 
our Climate Pledge Friendly program.Making Sustainable Shopping Simpler
As people change the way they shop and search for products 
that align with their values, Amazon is empowering our 
customers to make more informed shopping decisions 
every day.
Our Approach
Through the Climate Pledge Friendly  program, we are 
helping customers in the U.S. and Europe discover and shop 
for more-sustainable products. To identify these products, 
we partner with a wide range of trusted and transparent 
external certifications . Qualifying products are labeled 
in shopping results and have additional sustainability 
information on their product pages. 
We also developed our own certification, Compact by  
Design , to identify products that have a more efficient 
design. By eliminating excess air, water, and packaging, 
products require less packaging and become more efficient 
to ship. At scale, these small differences in product size and 
weight lead to significant carbon-emission reductions. 
Our Journey
Since we launched Climate Pledge Friendly in 2020, the 
number of products included in the program has grown 
from 75,000 to more than 250,000 by the end of 2021. 
Search rates for these products have also increased 
significantly during the same time frame. In 2021, more than 
370 million Climate Pledge Friendly units were shipped to 
Amazon customers and we welcomed 20 new third-party 
sustainability certifications to the program. See a full list of 
Climate Pledge Friendly certifications on Amazon.com .370M+

experiments to increase the discoverability of Climate Pledge 
Friendly products. This included a new Guided Buying  tool 
for Amazon Business Prime customers, designed to spotlight 
Climate Pledge Friendly products. The tool has been adopted by 1,650 organizations since launching in July 2021. 
Guided Buying steers business customers to Climate Pledge 
Friendly products as the preferred procurement option by 
their organizations.
Everyday Essentials, Consciously Created 
With Amazon Aware
In early 2022, Amazon launched Amazon Aware,  
a new line of everyday essential items with third-
party certifications featured in our Climate Pledge 
Friendly program.
Amazon Aware helps customers in the U.S., Canada, and 
Europe to shop for products made from materials such 
as recycled polyester, organic cotton, and bio-based 
ingredients. The line features products across apparel, home, beauty, and other categories—all with product-
specific certifications, such as Global Recycled Standard for 
recycled polyester content in apparel items.
Bedding and bath products use certified organic cotton 
and are certified by MADE IN GREEN by OEKO-TEX, which 
verifies that products are tested for harmful substances 
and made in safer workplaces with reduced environmental 
impacts. Household cleaners are made with U.S. Department 
of Agriculture-certified, bio-based cleaning formulas.

The following set of sustainability commitments guide 
Amazon Private Brands and Whole Foods Market decisions 
for sourcing materials and ingredients: 
  Animal Welfare
As retailers of animal-derived products, we recognize our 
responsibility to uphold animal welfare within our supply 
chain. We expect our suppliers to uphold the Five Freedoms 
framework for animal welfare, which mandates freedom 
from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom 
from pain, injury, or disease; freedom to express normal 
behavior; and freedom from fear and distress. We expect 
our suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and to take 
a zero-tolerance approach to animal cruelty, abuse, and 
neglect. We encourage suppliers to continuously improve 
their animal welfare standards and practices, and to work 
toward recognized animal welfare certifications or industry 
guidelines that include welfare provisions. For information 
about animal welfare at Whole Foods Market, see our  
Meat Department Quality Standards . 
  Cocoa, Coffee, and Tea 
Amazon is committed to sourcing cocoa, coffee, and tea 
that is certified against sustainability standards by Rainforest 
Alliance or Fairtrade International for our grocery Amazon 
Private Brands2 selection in Europe. For cocoa products in 
Europe, other independently verified third-party schemes 
(such as Cocoa Horizons) may also be used, subject to review 
and approval. Most of our Private Brands ground, whole bean, 
and pods coffee products in North America are also certified 
by Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade International, or Fair Trade 
USA, and we expect the remaining selection to transition 
in 2022. Sourcing Sustainable Materials 
In addition to offering more-sustainable choices, we want our 
Amazon Private Brands to support responsible supply chains 
and contribute to growing circular economies. From groceries 
and cleaning supplies to fashion and devices, we carefully 
consider the materials and lifecycle impacts across our product 
categories by asking: How can these products be better? 
Our Approach
We are working to enhance the certification and traceability 
of key raw materials and ingredients in our consumable 
products. We also participate in industry partnerships and 
working groups that drive greater adoption of sustainable 
and responsible practices. Additionally, we are increasing 
the amount of recycled fiber used in many of our Amazon 
Private Brands apparel products. All 365 by Whole Foods Market brand chocolate bars, 
chocolate chips, and baking chocolate are certified by Fair 
Trade USA, and in 2021, we transitioned all tea under the 
same brand to be certified by either Fair Trade USA or 
Rainforest Alliance. In addition, all 365 by Whole Foods Market 
packaged coffee is responsibly sourced and certified according 
to an approved third-party certification, including Rainforest 
Alliance, Fair Trade USA, or Fairtrade International. Whole 
Foods Market is also a member of Conservation International’s 
Sustainable Coffee Challenge, a collaborative effort of 
companies, governments, NGOs, research institutions, and 
others to transition the coffee sector to be more sustainable.  
  Cotton
We are striving to source all cotton for our Amazon Private 
Brands apparel products from more-sustainable sources by 
the end of 2022. This includes using cotton sourced from 
recycled materials, from farms certified as producing organic 
cotton, or through Better Cotton , a global nonprofit that 
aims to transform the cotton supply chain by developing 
Better Cotton as a sustainable mainstream commodity.  
  Eggs
Amazon is committed to sourcing cage-free eggs in our 
grocery Private Brands whole shell egg products in North 
America and Europe. At Whole Foods Market, all shell and 
liquid eggs sold in our dairy cases and used in our kitchens and 
bakeries in the U.S. go beyond cage-free and are audited to 
one of four production systems to meet Whole Foods Market’s 
Animal Welfare Standards for Laying Hens . At Whole Foods 
Market in Canada, all eggs come from cage-free hens.  Leather
We are striving to source all leather for our Amazon Private 
Brands apparel and shoe products from more-sustainable 
sources by the end of 2023. To achieve this, we will source 
from tanneries that meet the Leather Working Group’s  
bronze level award or higher.

  Pork
In addition to complying with the European restrictions on 
the use of gestation crates, Amazon is committed to sourcing 
gestation crate-free pork by 2025 in our grocery Private Brands 
fresh pork products in North America. At Whole Foods Market, 
all pork sold in the Meat Department is also crate-free and 
certified by the Global Animal Partnership—a nonprofit alliance 
of producers, retailers, animal advocates, and scientists that 
certifies producers’ animal welfare practices to more than 100 
animal welfare standards. See Whole Foods Market’s Meat 
Department Quality Standards  for more information.  
  Recycled Fabrics
We are increasing the use of recycled fabrics in Amazon 
Private Brands apparel products, including moving from 
conventional to recycled polyester, and launching products 
made from innovative recycled fibers.  
  Seafood
Amazon is committed to sourcing seafood that is certified or 
rated against sustainability standards for our grocery Private 
Brands selection in North America and Europe, as well as 
throughout Whole Foods Market’s Seafood Department. 
For wild-caught seafood under these selections, single-
ingredient fresh, frozen, and canned products must be 
sourced from fisheries that are certified against sustainability 
criteria by the Marine Stewardship Council Standard or rated 
“Green” or “Yellow” by Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood 
Watch program. Amazon’s grocery Private Brands wild-
caught seafood products may also be part of a credible 
fishery improvement program with a progress rating of C   Man-Made Cellulosic Fibers
We are striving to source all man-made cellulosic fibers—
including rayon, viscose, lyocell, and modal—for our Amazon 
Private Brands apparel products from more-sustainable sources 
by the end of 2022. We use the nonprofit Canopy’s   
tools and reports to help avoid fibers sourced from 
endangered forests, endangered species’ habitats, or other 
controversial sources.  
  Palm Oil
Amazon uses palm oil certified against sustainability 
standards in our Private Brands food and nonfood products 
in North America and Europe. In a small number of cases, 
palm oil credits may be used to cover small volumes and 
complex derivatives. We revisit these cases annually with 
applicable suppliers and agree on plans to transition to 
physically certified palm oil where possible. In addition, 100% 
of 365 by Whole Foods Market brand food items containing 
palm oil, palm kernel oil, palm fruit oil, and palm shortening 
are produced using sustainable oil products . 
  Paper
In North America and Europe, Amazon grocery Private 
Brands are committed to sourcing paper products such 
as paper towels, toilet paper, and facial tissue that are 
certified against sustainability standards or as recycled by 
organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), 
Sustainable Forestry Initiative, and Programme for the 
Endorsement of Forest Certification. In addition, all 365 by 
Whole Foods Market paper products are either made from 
100% recycled materials or certified by FSC. or higher. For single-ingredient farmed seafood, Amazon 
grocery Private Brands products must be certified by the 
Aquaculture Stewardship Council, certified organic by EU 
organic, Naturland, or other approved schemes, or certified 
2 stars or higher by the Global Aquaculture Alliance’s Best 
Aquaculture Practices. All Whole Foods Market farm-raised 
fresh or frozen seafood meets our Responsibly Farmed 
standards, is traceable to the source, and requires third-party 
verification of water quality and dozens of other quality 
standards. See Whole Foods Market’s Seafood Department 
Quality Standards  for more information. Learn more about our Restricted Substance List , which 
provides an extensive list of chemicals we seek to avoid in 
Amazon Private Brands baby, household cleaning, personal 
care, and beauty products, and applies to all suppliers of 
these product categories in the U.S. and Europe.
Our Food Contact Materials Restricted Substance List   
outlines the chemicals of concern and nonrecyclable 
materials we prohibit in Amazon Kitchen food 
contact packaging.
In addition, every food product sold by Whole Foods 
Market must meet rigorous quality standards , which 
prohibit more than 230 preservatives, flavors, colors, 
sweeteners, and other ingredients. Whole Foods Market 
also has standards for all household cleaning ,  
beauty, and body care .

Designing Our Devices and Services 
for Sustainability
Amazon devices and services are a part of everyday life 
for millions of customers around the world. They inform, 
entertain, and connect our customers, and we are working 
hard to make our devices more sustainable. That includes 
helping customers reduce their impact on the environment 
through our products and services. 
Our Approach
We design our devices to be more sustainable by measuring 
and reducing carbon emissions at all stages of the product 
lifecycle, from how the devices are made to how they are 
used and ultimately disposed of. We extend our impact 
by delivering products and experiences to help customers 
manage their own environmental impact. 
  Materials and Chemicals
We incorporate recycled materials into many new Amazon 
devices. In 2021, we launched several Echo, Fire TV, Fire 
Tablet, Kindle, and Smart Home devices and accessories 
that include up to 60% recycled molded plastic, up to 
100% recycled fabrics, up to 100% recycled aluminum, 
and up to 70% recycled magnesium, depending on the 
product. We also incorporated 50% recycled plastic into 
certain power adapters that ship with our devices.
To advance the move to safer chemistry, we joined 
ChemFORWARD  as a co-design partner. Through this 
partnership, we are collaborating with industry peers to 
proactively identify harmful chemicals and safer alternatives 
ahead of regulations.  Packaging
In 2020, we committed to making Amazon device packaging 
100% recyclable by 2023. Additionally, we are working 
to source 100% of the wood fiber in our packaging from 
responsibly managed forests or recycled sources. We have 
made significant progress toward our goals, eliminating 
more than 29 million plastic bags from our device packaging 
between September 2020 and September 2021. For new 
Echo, Fire TV Stick, Fire Tablet, and Kindle Paperwhite devices 
launched in 2021, 94%–98% of the packaging is made 
of wood fiber-based materials from responsibly managed 
forests or recycled sources, depending on the product. 
  Energy
In 2020, Amazon became the first consumer electronics 
company to commit to addressing the electricity used by our 
devices through renewable energy development, starting 
with our Echo devices. We are also making investments 
in additional wind and solar farm capacity that, by 2025, 
will be equal to the energy use of Fire TV and Ring devices 
worldwide. Combined, we expect these projects will produce 
over 5 million megawatt-hours of clean energy per year—
that’s enough to power more than 400,000 homes.
To accompany our investments in renewable energy, we also 
continue to make our devices more energy efficient. We have 
been rolling out Low Power Mode to new devices, as well as 
to older devices already in customers’ homes. By the end of 
2021, over 50% of all Echo and Fire TV devices in customers’ 
homes had Low Power Mode. We also launched a number of 
new Fire Tablet, Fire TV, and Amazon Smart Home devices in 
2021 that were designed for energy efficiency and earned 
the ENERGY STAR certification.  Reliability
We design our devices with best-in-class reliability models so 
that they are more resilient, last longer, and don’t need to be 
replaced as often. We also release over-the-air software updates 
for our customers’ devices with feature and security updates.  
  Suppliers
We work with our suppliers to encourage sustainability as a 
top priority. In 2021, we launched our Zero Waste to Landfill 
program for suppliers. Ten of our supplier sites responsible for 
the final assembly of some of our most popular Echo, Kindle, 
and Fire TV devices achieved UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill Silver 
or Platinum certification—a significant step toward achieving 
our zero-waste ambitions. This certification indicates that 
waste has been handled in environmentally responsible ways, 
diverting more than 90% of a facility’s waste from landfill 
through methods other than waste to energy.  
  Climate Pledge Friendly
We partner with trusted and transparent external 
certifications to validate the sustainability of our products 
and clearly communicate this to customers with the Climate 
Pledge Friendly label. In 2020 and 2021, our Echo, Fire TV, 
Fire Tablet, Kindle Paperwhite, and Smart Home devices and 
accessories launched with the Climate Pledge Friendly   
label. Many of these products carry the Carbon Trust’s 
Reducing CO 2 certification, demonstrating a reduction 
in the carbon emissions of a product year over year. The 
Amazon Smart Thermostat is the first Amazon device to be 
ECOLOGO Silver certified—a certification that demonstrates 
products meet standards that can reduce the environmental 
impact of one or more stages of the product lifecycle.  Alexa 
We are making it easier for customers to understand their 
home energy use with the Alexa energy dashboard , 
available in the U.S. The dashboard works with compatible 
smart lights, plugs, switches, water heaters, thermostats, 
televisions, and Echo devices, allowing customers to easily 
estimate the energy used by these devices. Customers 
can also enable Alexa to help them conserve energy with 
Hunches. For example, if Alexa has a Hunch that a customer 
is away and forgot to turn off a light, Alexa can automatically 
turn it off, helping customers save energy and reduce 
carbon emissions. 
  Extending Our Impact
To drive change beyond our business, we look for ways to 
share learnings and innovations that have shaped the way 
we design our products. This allows others to leverage our 
expertise and make more-sustainable products for their 
own customers. In early 2022, we published a paper called 
Decarbonizing and Neutralizing the Use Phase of Connected 
Devices  , focused on how we are integrating carbon-
reduction strategies across the use phase of our devices. 
These strategies account for an estimated 10%–15% of the 
overall carbon footprint of rechargeable battery-operated 
devices and an estimated 60%–80% of the footprint of 
plugged-in devices. At Amazon, we recognize that we cannot 
solve this challenge alone, and we are eager to invite other 
consumer electronics companies and connected device 
manufacturers to join the mission of driving to a net-zero 
carbon use phase.

Sustainability in 
the Cloud
AWS is the world’s most 
comprehensive and broadly 
adopted cloud offering, with 
millions of global users depending 
on it every day. To build a 
sustainable business for our 
customers and for the world we all 
share, we are designing data centers 
that provide the efficient, resilient 
service our customers expect while 
minimizing our environmental 
footprint—and theirs.Our Approach
We focus on efficiency across all aspects of our infrastructure, 
from the design of our data centers and hardware to 
modeling the performance of our operations for continuous 
enhanced efficiency. We are on a path to power our 
operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025. These 
renewable energy investments help power our data centers, 
as part of our commitment to reach net-zero carbon across 
our operations by 2040. 
For AWS, operating sustainably also means reducing the 
amount of water we use to cool our data centers. Our holistic 
approach minimizes both energy and water consumption in 
our operations and guides the development of our water use 
strategy for each AWS Region where we operate. 
In addition, we work to reduce the carbon emitted during the 
extraction, manufacturing, and transportation of materials 
to data center construction sites. Reducing this embodied 
carbon offers a significant opportunity to cut our overall 
emissions from data centers. 
Energy Efficiency
We are using innovation to improve power efficiency in 
multiple ways, including our investment in AWS-designed 
chips and the AWS Nitro System. For instance, AWS-
designed Graviton3 is our most power-efficient general-
purpose processor. Graviton3-based Elastic Compute Cloud 
(EC2) instances use up to 60% less energy for the same 
performance than non-Graviton EC2 instances. With the 
world’s increasing need for computing and as machine 
learning has become mainstream, continually innovating 
at the chip level will be critical to sustainably powering the 
workloads of the future. AWS also continually innovates on cooling efficiency. For 
example, we worked with our vendors to optimize the 
longevity and airflow performance of the cooling medium 
used in our data center cooling systems. The new medium 
provides twice the service life and allows air to pass through 
more easily than previous iterations, saving fan energy. This 
has significant impacts on building energy performance, 
reducing the energy use of cooling equipment by 20%. 
Predicting and Tracking Performance
We use advanced modeling methods, such as computational 
fluid dynamics tools, to optimize our data center design. 
This allows us to fully understand how the data center 
will perform before it is ever built, enabling us to optimize 
for higher reliability and energy efficiency in our systems. 
Once our data centers are operational, real-time, physics-
based models allow us to further improve and optimize our 
designs. We build these custom models using AWS services 
and weather datasets from the Amazon Sustainability 
Data Initiative to predict system performance for our sites 
and track their performance against how they should 
be operating. 
Reducing Embodied Carbon
In addition to emissions from our energy usage, AWS 
addresses a wide range of indirect emissions—including 
those associated with the construction of our data centers. 
Steel is one of the largest contributors of embodied carbon 
in the structure of AWS data centers and we are lowering 
these emissions by working with mills using electric arc 
furnace production processes. Unlike conventional steel 
produced from primary materials, coal, and gas, our suppliers 
are using up to 100% recycled content and are powered by 
electricity only, reducing embodied carbon up to 70%. We delivered six projects constructed with recycled steel in 2021 
and will expand this to all future U.S. and European data 
centers moving forward.
Concrete also contributes a large share of embodied carbon 
in data center construction, and AWS has multiple initiatives 
to reduce the carbon impact of the concrete required. For 
example, our design standards now require concrete with a 
20% reduction in embodied carbon versus standard concrete 
for new U.S. data centers, and we are expanding this 
requirement globally.

AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool
As AWS continues to invest in sustainability across our 
infrastructure, many of our customers have asked us 
to help measure the carbon footprint of their AWS 
workloads—both to understand how moving to AWS 
reduces their carbon footprint and to report their 
overall footprint.
Our new customer carbon footprint tool  uses simple 
visualizations to show customers their historical carbon 
emissions, evaluate related trends as their use of AWS 
evolves, estimate emissions avoided by using AWS 
instead of an on-premises data center, and review 
forecasted emissions based on their current usage. 
The forecast shows how customers’ footprints will change 
as Amazon stays on path to powering our operations with 
100% renewable energy by 2025, five years earlier than 
the original target of 2030, and drives toward net-zero 
carbon by 2040.In addition, historical carbon emissions data is available 
based on a customer’s AWS use from January 2020 
onward. This data includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions. Scope 1 emissions come directly from a 
company’s operations, while Scope 2 emissions come 
from the generation of purchased energy, such as the 
electricity used to power Amazon facilities. 
The customer carbon footprint tool uses carbon data 
that meets the widely adopted international standard of 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which supplies the world’s 
most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standards. 
When signed into the AWS Billing console, customers can 
view their carbon emissions data by geographical location 
and by AWS service, such as EC2 and Amazon Simple 
Storage Service (Amazon S3). They can also measure 
changes in their carbon footprint over time, as they 
deploy new resources in the cloud.Moving to AWS Can Help Significantly Lower Carbon
Studies by 451 Research , part of S&P Global Market Intelligence, have shown that AWS’ 
infrastructure is more efficient than on-premises data centers. AWS is 3.6 times more energy 
efficient than the median of U.S. enterprise data centers surveyed and up to five times more 
energy efficient than the average in Europe. A similar study that surveyed organizations in 
Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Australia, and India found that, on average, moving to the 
cloud was up to five times more energy efficient than using their on-premises data centers.
After analyzing several regions, 451 Research also found that AWS can lower customers’ 
workload carbon footprints by nearly 80% compared to surveyed enterprise data centers, 
and up to 96% once AWS is powered with 100% renewable energy—a target we are on 
path to meet by 2025.

Community Water Programs
Water is a key resource we share with those who live where 
we operate, so we look for opportunities to return water 
to these communities. For example, we partnered with the 
City of Umatilla and the West Extension Irrigation District 
to deliver water to farmers in Oregon. Instead of going 
to a wastewater treatment plant, our clean cooling water 
goes into a canal that delivers the water to farmers for use 
in irrigation. With this project, we reuse up to 96% of the 
wastewater we discharge from our data centers in this region.
In 2021, we funded watershed restoration efforts by 
The Nature Conservancy in Cape Town, South Africa, and 
Recycled Water
We evaluate the opportunity to reduce our consumption 
of potable water and are actively expanding our use of 
nonpotable and recycled water for cooling purposes. In 
certain regions, we work directly with utilities and regulators 
to obtain approval for the use of recycled water in direct 
evaporative cooling technology. We are continuing to work 
with water utilities in various regions to expand this recycled 
water infrastructure. Through these actions, we are actively 
contributing to sustainable water solutions by reducing 
our impact on the local potable water supply for the 
communities where we operate.
On-Site Water Treatment
We use on-site, modular water-treatment systems in 
multiple regions, which allow us to remove scale-forming 
minerals and reuse water for more cycles. Increasing our 
“cycles of concentration” contributes to reducing the water 
intake needed to cool our data centers.Water Stewardship in Data Centers
Amazon knows water is a precious resource. Our holistic 
approach minimizes both energy and water consumption 
in our data center operations and guides our water use 
strategy for each AWS Region. This starts with evaluating 
climate patterns, local water management and availability, 
and opportunities to avoid using potable water sources 
whenever possible. We are committed to conserving and 
reusing water, both in our on-site operations and by working 
with private and public entities to support water availability 
in communities where we operate data centers. 
Evaporative Cooling
Our preferred cooling strategy for data centers uses 
evaporative technologies. We analyze the weather in each 
region and monitor our cooling system, which is designed 
to maximize environmental cooling and minimize water use. 
During the hottest months of the year, we have optimized 
systems to minimize water usage. Outside air is cooled 
through an evaporative process and pushed into the server 
rooms to keep hardware at stable operating temperatures. 
With this design, even our largest data centers at full 
capacity would use, on average, about the same water in 
a year as only 25 U.S. households. During cooler months, 
where possible, outside air is supplied directly to the data 
center without needing to be cooled.
We are constantly innovating the design of our cooling 
systems to further reduce water usage. We are installing 
sensors that provide real-time water-use data to operators 
and sustainability teams. By analyzing this data, we can 
identify opportunities to reduce water usage and rapidly 
make operational changes.São Paulo, Brazil. These completed projects have restored 
365 hectares of land and increased water supply availability 
by 45 million gallons per year.
Through partnerships with Water.org and WaterAid in India 
and Indonesia, we initially intended to provide clean water to 
165,000 people. By the time these partnerships concluded in 
early 2022, we surpassed our goal and provided clean water 
and sanitation to over 250,000 community members. In 2022, 
we began supporting a new set of projects, which include 
wetland creation in the Thames River Basin in England and 
water quality projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in 
the U.S.

Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative 
The Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)  helps 
researchers, scientists, and innovators around the world 
advance their work on sustainability-related research. The 
program provides publicly available, free access to important 
scientific data that can otherwise be hard for researchers to 
access or analyze.
Our Approach
ASDI works with scientific organizations around the world 
to identify important datasets, which are then hosted for 
free by the AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program. The 
program currently hosts petabytes of data including weather 
observations, ocean temperatures, climate projection data, 
and satellite imagery.
Our approach allows sustainability experts to analyze 
massive amounts of data in minutes, regardless of where 
they are in the world or how much local storage space or 
computing capacity they can access. 
Innovating for Sustainability in 
the Cloud 
From university researchers to local governments and federal 
agencies to private startups, organizations leverage ASDI to 
help address major sustainability challenges. ASDI encourages 
this by providing cloud grants to those interested in exploring 
the use of AWS’ technology. Here are some examples of how 
ASDI is helping drive sustainability innovations:Solcast 
Solcast is an Australian company that builds forecasts for 
solar industry customers using cloud cover, solar radiation, 
and photovoltaic (PV) power data. The forecasts help solar 
producers predict the amount of solar irradiance and the 
amount of solar PV energy that their farms may receive. 
Solcast’s forecasts rely on large datasets from a global fleet 
of weather satellites, including Geostationary Operational 
Environmental Satellites (GOES) data from the U.S. National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which 
Solcast accesses through ASDI. 
The data helps solar customers orchestrate renewable 
energy generation across electrical grids, visualize the impact 
of thousands of PV systems, and optimize utility-scale 
batteries and solar farms. In addition, the data helps identify 
the best locations for solar farms, enabling governments 
around the world to plan their transition toward a 100% 
renewable energy future. Learn more on the AWS blog .
Digital Earth Africa
Digital Earth Africa is a nonprofit working with African 
nations to provide local leaders with information to plan for 
impacts related to climate change, like flooding, droughts, 
and erosion. Through a collaboration with ASDI, Digital Earth 
Africa is using satellite imagery hosted on AWS to create a 
platform that helps monitor environmental conditions in the 
African continent.In Zanzibar, Tanzania, government officials and the State 
University of Zanzibar are using the Digital Earth Africa 
platform to monitor how coastal erosion, rising sea levels, 
and deforestation are contributing to the degradation of 
mangrove trees on the island. The data hosted on AWS, 
which local officials previously had no way to access, 
has helped leaders understand the need to restore their 
mangroves and led to an effort to plant 1,000 mangrove 
seeds per week .Weather data in particular can help shippers optimize their 
routes. Traditionally, these and other climate‐related datasets 
have resided around the world in large files and complex 
systems, making them hard to access without the aid of 
specialized computers. To solve this, nauticAi is leveraging 
weather forecast data through ASDI from NOAA and the 
Finnish Meteorological Institute. nauticAi’s technology also 
uses machine learning and artificial intelligence tools on AWS 
to further improve maritime operations. 
nauticAi
nauticAi is a maritime startup company from Finland that 
offers ocean freight shipping companies a real-time cloud 
platform to help them operate their fleets more efficiently. 
The technology analyzes a variety of data, including weather 
forecasts, engine performance, humidity, and motion, which 
operators can use to improve ships’ performance and help 
vessels avoid damaging storms. Qhub
The Earth Science Information Partners Lab, a scientific 
nonprofit, is working with ASDI to extend cloud credits to 
support the deployment of Qhub, a development space on 
the AWS Cloud that gives more than 90 scientists across four 
U.S. government agencies an area to share and analyze data.
This new space enables the U.S. federal government and the 
scientists to collaborate in ways that were previously difficult 
due to the lack of a shared computing infrastructure. The 
effort has helped accelerate research on everything from 
flooding to illegal mining while helping the scientists learn 
the benefits of collaborative data and computing.

Respecting 
Human Rights 
Throughout Our 
BusinessOur Approach
Our commitment and approach are informed by leading 
international standards and frameworks developed by the 
UN and the International Labour Organization (ILO). Amazon 
is committed to respecting and supporting the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), the UN 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the core Conventions 
of the ILO, and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work.
Our strategy to deliver on these commitments is based on 
the UNGPs and has five pillars: developing strong policies; 
embedding human rights into our business; assessing, 
prioritizing, and addressing risk through mechanisms; 
transparency and stakeholder engagement; and enabling 
access to effective remedy. 
We work to continuously improve, tracking our progress on 
our human rights commitments and reviewing and updating 
our policies, processes, and practices to put people at the 
center of our work. Strong Policies
Our efforts are anchored in policies that apply across our 
business—from our own operations to our supply chain, 
and from the design and use of our technology to the 
communities we impact. We regularly review our policies 
to identify areas for update and improvement, engaging 
external stakeholders and benchmarking against international 
human rights standards and evolving industry norms. 
Our Global Human Rights Principles  demonstrate our 
commitment to respecting human rights and the dignity of 
people connected to our business around the world. 
Our Supply Chain Standards  detail the requirements and 
expectations for our suppliers, their supply chains, and selling 
partners that list products in our stores. They are grounded 
in principles of inclusivity, continuous improvement, and 
supply chain accountability. We engage with suppliers that are 
committed to these same principles; suppliers commit to these 
standards as a condition of doing business with us. At least 
every three years, in line with industry best practices, we review 
our Supply Chain Standards against policies developed by 
industry associations. Additionally, we review these standards 
in consultation with human rights experts and organizations, 
including Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), Impactt 
Limited, International Center for Research on Women, Nest, 
the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), and UN Women.
Embedding Human Rights Into 
Our Business
We are committed to embedding human rights 
considerations into decision-making across our company and 
into our policy and governance framework. Amazon’s Board 
of Directors is responsible for the control and direction of 
Amazon and regularly reviews reports on various aspects of our business, including related risks and the strategies 
for addressing them. While the entire Board has overall 
responsibility for risk oversight, the Board has delegated 
responsibility for certain risks to its committees. 
Among other duties and responsibilities, the Nominating 
and Corporate Governance Committee oversees Amazon’s 
environmental, social, and corporate governance policies 
and initiatives. This includes policies and initiatives related 
to corporate social responsibility, such as human rights 
and ethical business practices, and related risks most 
relevant to Amazon’s operations and engagement with 
customers, suppliers, and communities. Among other duties 
and responsibilities, the Leadership Development and 
Compensation Committee oversees Amazon’s strategies and 
policies related to human capital management, including 
diversity and inclusion, workplace environment and safety, 
and corporate culture. The Committees regularly meet with 
management and review these matters.
As a global company, we recognize the responsibility 
and opportunity we have to raise awareness among our 
employees on human rights issues. We have a central team 
that works across the company to operationalize human 
rights due diligence and embed human rights considerations 
into everyday business decisions. We also offer trainings 
tailored to salient human rights risks. For example, our forced 
labor awareness program makes ongoing training available 
to employees around the world to recognize indicators of 
forced labor and report concerns to appropriate authorities 
in a way that puts the interests of potential victims first. Amazon is committed to treating 
the people connected to our entire 
value chain with fundamental 
dignity and respect. We strive to 
embed respect for human rights 
throughout our business activities 
and relationships.

Mechanisms to Assess, Prioritize, and 
Address Risk 
We are committed to assessing, prioritizing, and addressing 
adverse human rights impacts connected to our business 
and we are continually working to improve our approach. 
At Amazon, businesses deploy a variety of mechanisms to 
do this. 
In our supply chain, we assess and respond to risk by 
leveraging internal and external data and guidance from 
external stakeholders, including industry experts, civil society 
groups, and NGOs. We engage directly with suppliers and 
their workers and conduct independent audits to verify 
compliance with our Supply Chain Standards. We also work 
with suppliers on appropriate remediation measures and 
offer partnerships and programs to help them address risks 
and invest in worker well-being. We recognize that audits alone are insufficient to drive long-
term change across industries. We, like many companies 
in similar industries, are exploring new ways to encourage 
improvement in worker protections. This includes supporting 
suppliers’ efforts to improve their grievance mechanisms, 
supplier capacity-building programs, worker trainings, and 
collaborations with other brands and civil society. We currently 
focus our supply chain efforts on key commitment areas: Safe 
Workplaces, Freely Chosen Employment, Gender Equity, Fair 
Wages, Environmental Protection, and Grievance Mechanisms.Identifying Salient Human Rights Risks 
The UNGPs guide companies to prioritize the most severe 
risks to people connected to their operations and business 
relationships and are the foundation of our human rights 
due diligence approach. Teams use a variety of tools—
saliency assessments, human rights impact assessments 
(HRIAs), and other human rights-based processes grounded 
in the UNGPs—to assess, prioritize, and address the most 
severe risks to people. 
In 2020, Amazon worked with sustainability and human 
rights consulting firm Article One Advisors to conduct 
our first enterprisewide saliency assessment, focused on 
identifying salient human rights risks across our business. 
We consulted a diverse group of external human rights experts, incorporated their feedback into the results, and 
benchmarked the results against internationally recognized 
human rights standards. The assessment identified a 
set of priority human rights values, three foundational 
commitments, and key salient human rights risks for Amazon.
The saliency assessment was a key milestone in the 
development of our human rights due diligence strategy. 
Building on this work, in 2021, we made progress on 
our salient human rights risks and furthered our efforts 
to implement human rights due diligence mechanisms. 
What follows are some examples of how we assessed 
and addressed our salient risks, prioritizing our three 
foundational commitments. Learn more about our work to  
source products responsibly .
Learn more about our approach to employee engagement ;  
our efforts on diversity, equity, and inclusion ;  
and our investments in workplace safety .Within our own operations, our central team focuses on 
human rights due diligence and collaborates with teams 
dedicated to assessing, prioritizing, and addressing human 
rights risks to our employees. These teams focus on 
establishing open communication with Amazon employees, 
providing them with meaningful grievance mechanisms, 
building a diverse and inclusive workplace, and keeping our 
employees safe. We know we have more to do, and we are 
committed to widening our lens to better understand the 
potential human rights impacts of our business.

Meaningful Consultation With Stakeholders
We worked with human rights expert organizations to 
advance our human rights due diligence, including Article 
One Advisors, BSR, Impactt Limited, and The Centre for Child 
Rights and Business. Some of the outcomes from Amazon’s 
partnerships and collaborations that were accomplished in 
2021 include:
• We created a $150 million Black Business Accelerator 
program in partnership with our Black Employee Network 
affinity group and strategic partners with experience 
supporting Black businesses, including the Minority Business 
Development Agency and the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc. 
Learn more on page 54 . 
• We engaged the Policing Project at New York University 
School of Law to audit the Neighbors application and 
Neighbors Public Safety Service—which provide users with 
real-time crime and safety alerts—to help improve our Ring 
products and services from a civil liberties and policing ethics 
perspective. Read our report  on the Ring blog.
• We signed and adopted the UN Women’s Empowerment 
Principles (WEPs)  as part of our long-standing 
commitment to gender equality. The WEPs were established 
by the UN Global Compact and UN Women to offer 
businesses guidance on ways to promote gender equality 
and women’s empowerment in the workplace, marketplace, 
and community.
• We also signed the Trusted Cloud Principles , including 
principles recognizing that “international human rights 
law enshrines a right to privacy,” and committed to the 
Partnership on AI , working with partners to help drive 
responsible artificial intelligence solutions for people 
and society. • We launched a $12 million, five-year partnership with the 
U.S. National Safety Council to uncover new ways to prevent 
and address musculoskeletal disorders. 
Opportunity for Concerns to be Heard and Issues Resolved
We developed a set of Worker Voice Criteria, outlining key 
expectations for worker voice mechanisms in our supply 
chain. This is part of our efforts to build our capacity to 
provide suppliers and service providers with a variety of 
trusted tools, products, and systems in order to hear directly 
from workers about their experiences and to support the 
resolution of issues from workers’ perspectives. 
Focus on Vulnerable Groups
We signed the memorandum on “Standing up for Children’s 
Rights in the Digital Environment” at the 2021 Paris Peace 
Forum. Additionally, we expanded partnerships with 
RBA and the International Organization for Migration to 
help strengthen suppliers’ practices around responsible 
recruitment of foreign migrant workers. Learn more about our engagement with  
stakeholders on our website .

Learn more in our 2021 Modern Slavery Statement .Human Rights Impact Assessments 
Our teams use HRIAs as a due diligence tool to identify 
and address adverse impacts business activities might 
have on individuals such as workers, local community 
members, or consumers. HRIAs surface detailed information 
about our human rights risks and root causes, as well as 
stakeholder perspectives, so that we can address those 
risks with targeted action. For each HRIA, we partner with 
an independent human rights consulting firm to conduct 
the assessment, facilitate stakeholder engagement, and 
deliver recommendations for improved business practices 
to address the relevant human rights risks. 
Below we provide an update on our first HRIA, summarized 
in our 2020 Sustainability Report . 
Update on Our Devices Supply Chain HRIA 
In 2020, we conducted Amazon’s first HRIA on the raw 
and recovered materials supply chain for Amazon-branded 
digital devices. Using the UNGPs as a framework to guide 
the assessment, the HRIA results indicated we are directly 
linked to potential risks for Tier 1–2 manufacturing and 
reverse logistics suppliers. For minerals, metals, plastics, 
and synthetics suppliers, results indicated we are indirectly linked to potential risks. We have policies and mechanisms 
in place to help address these potential risks, including our 
Supply Chain Standards, regular supplier assessments, and 
grievance mechanisms. 
In 2021, we began implementing recommendations from 
the HRIA, such as increasing our support for industry 
collaboration on responsible mineral sourcing, and building 
the capacity of our supply chain partners to effectively 
manage human rights risks. We also began developing 
a multiyear, Amazon-branded digital devices strategy to 
address risks, seeking perspectives from organizations with 
expertise in human rights, inclusive economy, circularity, 
and responsible innovation to meet the expectations of 
our customers and impacted communities. 
In 2021, several final assembly and manufacturing suppliers 
of Amazon-branded digital devices participated in the RBA 
Factory Lead Certification Program. The program trains 
factory management on effective worker communication 
and maintaining safe working conditions, allowing suppliers 
to proactively prevent or mitigate potential issues before 
they arise.

Transparency and Stakeholder 
Engagement
We are committed to driving best practices in human rights 
due diligence through increased disclosures about our 
approach and by expanding our stakeholder engagement. 
Each year, we track progress on our human rights 
commitments and publicly share up-to-date information 
about our programs, including external partnerships with 
organizations that share our core human rights values.
Transparency
Transparency is an important tool to help us understand and 
address risks in our value chain and identify opportunities for 
collaboration on systemic issues. We publish an interactive 
supply chain map  that provides details on suppliers of 
Amazon-branded apparel, consumer electronics, food and 
beverage, and home goods products. We provide data from 
supplier assessments annually, including year-over-year 
data on high- and medium-level issues in our supply chain. 
We report on actions to prioritize the three foundational 
commitments identified in our enterprisewide saliency 
assessment. We also contribute lists of our apparel suppliers  
to the Open Apparel Registry to foster brand collaboration 
and action in the apparel industry.
We report annually in line with the UNGP Reporting Framework 
and publish an annual Modern Slavery Statement . Stakeholder Engagement
Engagement with external stakeholders is key to our human 
rights due diligence approach. This collaboration is essential 
to identifying positive outcomes for people connected to 
our business and is part of our responsibility to respect 
human rights in line with the UNGPs. We rely on experts and 
affected rights-holders to inform our approach and validate 
that our efforts have the intended impact. Through regular 
stakeholder engagement and strategic partnerships, we 
incorporate invaluable expert input into our work, helping us 
achieve greater impact on people connected to our business 
around the world. Gender Equity
In 2021, we signed and adopted the UN Women’s 
Empowerment Principles (WEPs) . Supported by 
more than 6,000 corporate signatories, the WEPs were 
established by the UN Global Compact and UN Women 
to offer businesses guidance on ways to promote gender 
equality and women’s empowerment in the workplace, 
marketplace, and community. 
“ Our support of the Women’s Empowerment 
Principles underscores our long-standing 
work to promote gender equality and 
empowerment in the workplace, marketplace, 
and communities, and we are encouraged 
to see other like-minded businesses coming 
together to drive positive change.” 
Andy Jassy 
President and CEO, Amazon
We also made a $1 million contribution to the Resilience 
Fund for Women in Global Value Chains . The Resilience 
Fund pools corporate investments to drive local, women-
led solutions to some of the toughest problems facing 
women in global value chains. Established by BSR, the 
UN Foundation, and Women Win, the Resilience Fund aims 
to raise at least $10 million to make strategic, long-term 
investments in women’s economic resilience, health, and 
well-being. Amazon’s donation will be invested in local 
organizations globally, serving women in manufacturing, 
apparel, and agricultural supply chain communities.

Grievance Mechanisms and Effective 
Access to Remedy
As part of our first enterprisewide human rights saliency 
assessment, we made a foundational commitment that 
those in our value chain have the opportunity for concerns 
to be heard and issues resolved. Focusing on listening to the 
people connected to our business and understanding their 
experiences to address risks and remedy issues is a critical 
element of our human rights approach and a core obligation 
under the UNGPs.In our operations, consistent, honest, and open communication 
with our employees allows us to continually improve our 
workplace experience, empowering individuals to voice 
concerns and have them directly addressed by leadership. 
Our goal is to hear from and listen to everyone. Dedicated 
teams across the company focus on establishing open 
communication with our employees, providing them with 
meaningful grievance mechanisms and avenues for dialogue 
with leadership. Aligning with the UNGP framework, Amazon’s 
policies and practices are designed to promote respect for 
the rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining 
and to comply with the legal requirements of the countries 
where we operate. As stated in our Leadership Principles, 
we Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer, offering a safer, more 
productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just 
work environment. We have many policies, practices, and 
mechanisms in place to provide open lines of communication 
between leadership and employees and act regularly to 
address employee concerns and make improvements. We 
recognize that Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility. 
We must begin each day with a determination to make better, 
do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our 
partners, and the world at large.Worker Voice Mechanism Criteria
We developed a set of Worker Voice Criteria to outline key 
expectations and drive best practices for our suppliers and 
service providers that are implementing and maintaining 
worker voice mechanisms. These criteria draw from 
the UNGPs and the Worker Engagement Supported by 
Technology (WEST) Principles  to align these mechanisms 
with internationally recognized human rights. 
Worker Inclusive: Worker trust is paramount; workers 
should have input into the mechanisms’ design and 
performance, particularly how worker voice mechanisms 
will address and resolve issues.
Privacy Ensured: Mechanisms must never cause harm 
to workers; mechanisms must have adequate safeguards 
in place, providing workers with notice of how data will 
be protected. Equitable and Accessible: Mechanisms should 
accommodate diversity and ensure that workers have 
reasonable access to the information, advice, and expertise 
necessary to engage with the mechanism. Workers 
who face particular barriers due to language, literacy, 
or disability should have adequate assistance.
Transparent and Predictable: Mechanisms should 
provide users with clear procedures to set expectations 
on time frames, how outcomes will be monitored, 
and how stakeholders will be informed about the 
mechanism’s effectiveness.
Source of Continuous Learning: New mechanisms 
should be adequately resourced, developed to complement

In 2021, we expanded our efforts to help suppliers build 
and employ worker voice tools and improve their capacity 
to respond to worker grievances in Cambodia, China, India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.
Our aim is that every worker across our supply chain has access 
to an effective grievance mechanism. We work with suppliers 
to increase their capacity to develop these mechanisms by 
creating channels to hear directly from workers about their 
experiences and to support the resolution of issues from 
workers’ perspectives.Learn more about our

Our Approach
Amazon strives to be a great place to work, whether our 
employees are building lifelong careers with us or developing 
skills to help them on their professional journeys. This 
begins with offering competitive starting wages in locations 
around the world, and continues with benefits, support, and 
opportunities to help employees reach their full potential. 
Going Above and Beyond With 
Starting Wages
We’re proud that our average starting wage has increased 
to $18 per hour in the U.S. In the UK, Germany, and France, 
our minimum starting wages are 10 GBP, 12 EUR, and 
10.88 EUR, respectively.Providing 
a Range of 
Employee 
Benefits
We believe that a diverse, 
passionate workforce is key to 
a successful business. Amazon 
is building a strong culture and 
making investments to attract and 
retain the talented employees we 
need today and in the future.The Ripple Effect 
Sylvia’s Café, a Caribbean-style restaurant run by wife-and-husband team 
Sylvia Burke and François Theodore, is located near a 2.4 million square-
foot Amazon fulfillment center in Opa-locka, Florida. Throughout the 
pandemic, the presence of Amazon employees looking for great food 
meant that the doors of Sylvia’s Café didn’t shut. This was thanks, in part, 
to employees like Nelly Nelson, whose higher wage means she can make 
better food choices. 
“ Instead of fast food, I’m able to eat better, healthier 
food,” she said.
There are similar stories across our operations network, from EastBrew Café 
and Bakery near a fulfillment center in Eastvale, California, to The Parlor 
Salon and Spa in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. These are small examples of 
the big impact our wages are having on communities across the U.S.

Our Inclusive Benefits
Taking care of our employees’ health and wellness is a 
priority. We strive to offer benefits that are inclusive for our 
employees, regardless of their personal circumstances. 
We offer health care benefits to all regular, full-time Amazon 
employees in the U.S., including medical, prescription drug, 
dental, and vision coverage. In regions with fewer options 
for convenient access to high-quality and affordable primary 
and mental health care, we launched Neighborhood Health 
Centers to support our employees and their families, with 
17 locations across the U.S. as of the end of 2021.
We also developed a health care benefits system that, where 
possible, provides gender transition benefits, including 
gender affirmation. We maintain internal resources to help 
managers and team members support employees who 
are transitioning.Health care

A Family-Friendly Employer
We know that the time employees spend at work is just one 
part of what makes them who they are, and that balance 
between work and home is essential for their well-being. We 
prioritize benefits that support employees’ families of all kinds. 
In the U.S., for eligible full-time and reduced-time 
employees, Amazon offers up to 20 weeks of paid leave for 
birthing parents and up to six weeks for non-birth parents or 
parents who adopt. We also offer adoption reimbursement 
and access to comprehensive infertility resources and 
treatment coverage. In addition, our Leave Share program 
allows U.S. employees to donate up to six weeks of their 
paid parental leave to their partner should their partner’s 
employer not offer paid parental leave. Our Ramp Back 
program allows parents to work a reduced schedule for up 
to eight weeks after the birth or adoption of a child. 
Mental health resources are available 24/7 to all employees, 
their families, and anyone in their household through 
Amazon’s employee assistance program (EAP), which also 
offers virtual treatment options. This includes free access 
to a new mental health benefit launched in the U.S. in 
2021, called Resources for Living. This service provides 
a streamlined place for personalized, convenient, and 
confidential mental health and daily life support. For 
employees outside of the U.S., we offer 24/7, on-demand 
support for mental health and work-life concerns, along with 
immediate consultation and support after a critical incident 
or traumatic event. These services are available through our 
global EAP partners, including Workplace Options.
We also believe in providing support for child and adolescent 
mental health, including clinical guidance for parents of 
children who have neurodevelopmental disorders, such 
as autism spectrum disorders, or any type of behavioral, social, learning, or emotional challenge. Amazon provides 
employees in the U.S. free access to expert consultants and 
educational materials for parents to help children build the 
skills needed to reach their full potential. In 2022, we are 
expanding our programs globally to reach more employees, 
provide more mental health support for children and 
teens, and offer innovative solutions to meet the needs of 
neurodiverse families. This will include access to therapists 
and coaches, on-demand resources, and integration with 
other benefits such as the EAP.
We continue to evolve our benefits programs to support 
the needs of our diverse workforce. For example, in the U.S., 
Amazon offers FamilyFlex benefits to help bring more women 
and parents back to the workforce. These include Anytime 
Shift, which allows employees who choose these roles to 
create their own work schedule. There are currently over 
23,000 open roles that qualify for Anytime Shift, and more 
than 100,000 employees have taken advantage of this option.Inclusive Benefits for All
The benefits offered by Amazon can be truly life-changing. 
Take Luv-Luv , a former hairdresser who chose to work at 
an Amazon fulfillment center because of the quality of health 
benefits offered from the first day on the job. Crucially for 
Luv-Luv, this includes equal health coverage for transgender 
individuals, without exclusion for medically necessary care.
Since starting at the Amazon fulfillment center in Shakopee, 
Minnesota, nearly four years ago, Luv-Luv’s health benefits 
have covered four surgeries. 
“Before Amazon, I was pre-op transgender, and 
since then, I’ve fully transitioned,” she said. 
“Amazon paid for all that.”
Though the insurance benefit was her main reason for joining 
the company, the pay at Amazon helped Luv-Luv and her  
two pets afford a comfortable lifestyle. In addition to finding 
a healthy environment and work she loves, Luv-Luv’s role  
at Amazon offered another important benefit: inclusion,  
on her terms.
“Amazon has allowed me to live a comfortable 
life that I’ve always dreamed of,” she said. 
“I live on my own terms and I’m not dependent  
on anyone else. It’s been a phenomenal  
journey for me.”

Subsidizing Tuition Fees Through 
Career Choice
For many people aspiring to grow professionally, education 
may be the first stepping stone—and yet, it can be 
challenging to find the flexibility or resources to do so 
while working.
Thanks to Amazon Career Choice , our pre-paid tuition 
program, thousands of hourly employees in 14 countries 
are earning certificates and degrees. As of early 2022, 
courses available through Career Choice include those 
that employees can take to pursue an associate degree 
or bachelor’s degree in fields ranging from information 
technology to computer science, and from health care to 
transportation. In addition, our Career Choice program 
also supports employees pursuing high school completion, 
General Education Diplomas (GEDs), and English as a Second 
Language (ESL) proficiency certifications.
U.S. hourly employees who have been employed at Amazon 
for 90 days are eligible to participate in Career Choice. 
To make training even more accessible and reduce the 
need to commute to classes, we’ve built more than 140 
on-site classrooms, enabling employees to take college 
and technical classes inside our fulfillment centers.

We believe all employees should have the opportunity to 
learn new skills, grow, and build their careers as they develop 
their professional journeys. Some employees focus on skills 
that benefit their work at Amazon and some focus on skills 
that benefit their long-term career aspirations.

Taking a New Path—From Amazon to Medicine
There is a rising demand for health workers, offering a new 
opportunity for more people, like Ernesto Regis . Ernesto was 
working in a fulfillment center in Florida when his supervisor 
introduced him to Amazon Career Choice. Shortly after 
completing a medical assistant’s course through Career Choice, 
Ernesto was offered a job as a medical assistant. Today, Ernesto 
is continuing his journey in the health care field. 
“ I am now working as a phlebotomist and medical 
assistant. But I am not done yet,” he said. “I’ve 
enrolled in nursing and I’m taking classes to 
become a registered nurse. Amazon supported 
and financed a better future for me. Even though 
that future didn’t include them.”

Fostering 
Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion
Amazon’s ability to innovate on 
behalf of our customers relies on 
the perspectives and knowledge of 
people from all backgrounds. We 
think bigger, bolder, and better when 
we have diverse perspectives across 
our teams and we are committed to 
putting diversity, equity, and inclusion 
(DEI) at the front and center of 
everything we do.Our Approach 
We respect and value people of all identities and 
backgrounds, including gender, gender identity, race, 
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, military status, 
disability, and more. We take an intersectional approach 
to the policies, programs, and strategies we create for our 
employees, selling partners, suppliers, and customers to 
build representation and inclusion into our business. 
“ When I think about Amazon and the 
potential for impact, I’m energized by 
the possibilities. This work will require 
us to engage all communities, think 
globally, and cultivate a workplace that 
not only is diverse but also inspires a 
deep sense of belonging for every one 
of our employees. If we get this right, 
together we can create a greater sense 
of inclusion, not only within Amazon, 
but for Amazon customers around 
the world.”
Candi Castleberry  
Vice President of Global DEI, AmazonA Team Powering Change
Setting goals, regularly reviewing progress, and strong 
management are vital to driving lasting action and 
improving representation and inclusion throughout our 
business. In 2021, we welcomed a new Vice President of 
Global DEI, bringing in-depth expertise and experience. 
Candi Castleberry and her team are leading the refinement 
of Amazon’s global DEI strategy and companywide goals. 
Our DEI Champions 
Our work is guided by hundreds of global dedicated DEI 
professionals who work closely with business leaders to 
help Amazon maintain a diverse and high-performing 
work environment. Our approach to embedding DEI across 
our organization also extends to how we support our selling 
partners and launch products and services to the world. 
Accessibility Across Amazon 
When we think inclusively and design with 
different needs in mind, technology can 
empower everyone and support people with 
disabilities in new ways. We are continually 
enhancing our devices and services with new 
accessibility features, whether integrating 
Braille into our Fire tablet or improving Alexa 
to support our customers with disabilities. 
Alexa accessibility features range from adaptive 
listening to on-screen captioning and more. 
 
 For example, we launched the AWS Impact Accelerator ,  
a $30 million commitment to providing Black, Latinx, 
women, and LGBTQ+ founders of startups with equitable 
access to training, mentorship, tools, and resources. Startups 
will receive an unrestricted $125,000 cash grant and up to 
$100,000 in AWS Activate credits, as well as guidance from 
AWS technology experts, investors, and partners.
Scaling Our Work Through Strategic 
External Partnerships 
We believe we can achieve more by collaborating with 
leading organizations that are making a difference in 
historically underrepresented communities. Amazon partners 
with nonprofits like Management Leadership for Tomorrow, 
which works to strengthen the recruitment and retention 
of Black, Latinx, and Native American talent. In addition, our 
affinity groups are instrumental in building and nurturing 
external relationships as brand ambassadors.

Creating an Inclusive Culture 
At Amazon, inclusion means being valued, trusted, 
connected, and informed so that we can deliver the best 
results for our customers. 
We believe that building a sense of belonging, value, 
and opportunity is integral to people thriving in their 
lives and at work—and to what we can achieve as a 
company. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced by our 
Leadership Principles , which remind team members to 
seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and lead with 
empathy. One of our newest Leadership Principles—Strive 
to be Earth’s Best Employer—specifically calls on leaders to 
work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher 
performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. 
Our Inclusion Goals 
In 2021, we set enterprisewide goals to rapidly scale a more 
inclusive culture for employees across Amazon.
Spotlighting Our 2021 Inclusion Goals
• Ensure that 100% of employees take companywide required 
inclusion training.
• Build scalable mechanisms that address new instances of 
noninclusive terms in our code and document repositories 
or development tools.
• Build a scalable mechanism in Connections—our real-time 
employee listening tool—to inspect inclusion sentiment 
by demographic for all employees.
• Retain employees at statistically similar rates across 
all demographics.Amazon’s Affinity Groups 
Our affinity groups  are Amazon communities where 
employees can share experiences and ideas to passionately 
and positively impact the company. Our dedicated DEI teams 
consult with affinity group leaders to improve our inclusion 
efforts internally and externally, and each affinity group has 
an executive sponsor who supports them with engagement 
efforts. Collectively, more than 100,000 Amazon employees 
participated in our affinity groups in 2021.

Amazon recruits experienced military leaders from all branches and all 
backgrounds. Together, these leaders form important pipelines of talent. We 
offer veterans the Military Mentoring Program (MMP), a career-development 
resource that connects new employees with experienced employees who 
help them translate and apply their knowledge to Amazon.
New veteran hires who join the MMP complete a brief profile before being 
matched with a mentor, who then collaborates with them throughout their 
first year at Amazon. Mentors also assist mentees with progressing in the 
Military Ambassador Program, a 12-month development program focused 
on sharing resources such as writing exercises, videos, and virtual huddles.LGBTQ+ Equality 
Amazon and our employees stand together with the 
LGBTQ+ community. As of 2021, there were more than 
100 global chapters of Glamazon, our LGBTQ+ affinity 
group. We are committed to advancing equal rights and 
have a long track record of advocating for protections 
for the LGBTQ+ community. 
In the U.S. and India, Amazon provides transgender-
inclusive health benefits and gender transition benefits 
based on the Standards of Care published by the 
World Professional Association for Transgender Health. 
Amazon also holds a gender identity conference to 
build community, educate those outside of the LGBTQ+ 
community, and provide professional development 
opportunities for those at Amazon who are transitioning 
openly in the workplace.

inclusive benefits for employees . “ Diversity exists when you go above

you and inviting them to influence.”

Representation in Our Workforce 
We are committed to increasing representation of employees 
from historically underrepresented backgrounds at every 
level of our organization. To do so, we focus on hiring, 
retention, growth, development, and promotion. 
To find the best talent and support our search for diverse 
talent, we partner with organizations and academic 
institutions linked to underrepresented communities. In the 
U.S., these organizations include historically Black colleges 
and universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-serving institutions, 
women’s colleges, and tribal colleges.
Students visit Amazon’s campus for a range of programs 
and career enrichment experiences, such as our Represent 
the Future Summit. We also partner with organizations like 
Grace Hopper Celebration, Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 
Consortium Fellows, AfroTech, AnitaB.org, Lesbians Who 
Tech, Girls in Tech, American Indian Science and Engineering 
Society, and others. 
Amazon developed an online certification program with City 
University of Seattle to offer training to military employees 
and their families for higher-paying jobs. We also work 
with City University on its Apprenti program, which trains 
newcomers to the tech industry and places them in paid 
apprenticeships at companies like Amazon. 2x

The work of DEI requires everyone to disrupt biases 
that build barriers and create inequities. This includes 
representation in the workplace, as well as in the media 
we consume daily. The work is not easy, but we are 
committed to achieving real, lasting change. 
Working closely with the University of Southern 
California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, the 
International Documentary Association, and 
Gamechanger Films, we created the Inclusion Playbook   
to help people recognize biases that occur across the 
lifecycle of a series or movie—from production to launch. 
The Playbook explores this issue further by allowing 
people to understand how they can meet the Amazon 
Studios Inclusion Policy. 
By thinking about a story, casting, crewing up, and how 
to track and report inclusion successes, the Playbook 
is specifically designed to advance the visibility and 
responsible depictions of underrepresented communities. 
We view this as an evolving document that will be 
updated over time, offering a much-needed tool to 
guide decision-making in creative hiring practices. 
“ This Inclusion Playbook adds important, 
additional depth and guidance for our 
internal teams and external partners to 
ensure we continue to advance our shared 
mission of amplifying the best creatives 
and content around the world.”
Latasha Gillespie 
Executive Head, DEI, Amazon Studios Our Goals for Increasing Representation
In 2021, we set a number of goals to guide our efforts and 
progress for improved representation:
2021 Sustainability Report       Introduction     I     Environment     I     Society     I     Governance     I     Appendix 53  
Living Our Principles 
Amazon prioritizes equal pay. When we evaluate 2021 
compensation, including base compensation, cash bonuses, 
and stock, our reported data demonstrates that women 
globally and in the U.S. earned 99.8 cents and 99.9 cents, 
respectively, for every dollar that men earned performing 
the same jobs. Racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. earned 
99.2 cents for every dollar that white employees earned 
performing the same jobs.
In 2021, we further strengthened our long-standing 
commitment to gender equality by signing the UN Women’s 
Empowerment Principles (WEPs) . The WEPs were 
established by the UN Global Compact and UN Women 
to offer businesses guidance on ways to promote gender 
equality and women’s empowerment in the workplace, 
marketplace, and community. Advancing Social and Racial Justice 
We are committed to using our scale to amplify historically 
underrepresented voices and empower diverse communities. 
One of the ways we are doing this is by bridging the 
technology and science divide for underrepresented groups 
through science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) 
education programs and various learning events. This includes 
Amazon Future Engineer , our new Advanced Placement 
Computer Science programming curriculum  focused on 
equity and launched with Code.org. We also partner with Girls 
in Tech through AWS Academy, where we work closely with 
minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and community colleges 
to provide a free, ready-to-teach cloud computing curriculum. 
In 2021, we also announced 21 undergraduate and graduate 
recipients from HBCUs and MSIs for our Supply Chain 
Optimization Technologies organization’s fellowship .  
Through AWS education programs, we announced a 
collaborative effort with Howard University to equip 
students with competitive technical skills, provide educators 
with professional development opportunities, and drive 
entrepreneurship at the university. We’ve also launched 
statewide training and education initiatives, which are 
typically anchored by community colleges. Collaboration with 
community colleges helps AWS reach diverse populations 
of minority, underrepresented, and veteran populations, 
as well as urban and rural communities. In 2021, we also 
announced the $10 million AWS Artificial Intelligence and 
Machine Learning Scholarship , designed to prepare 
underrepresented and underserved students globally for 
careers in machine learning. Introducing Amazon’s Black 
Business Accelerator
In 2021, we launched the Black Business Accelerator (BBA)   
to target barriers to access and advancement, to drive 
economic equity for Black entrepreneurs, and to play a 
part in increasing the number of Black business owners in 
our industry.
Through our $150 million commitment, we are providing 
access to capital, business guidance, growth, and marketing 
support for current and aspiring Black small business 
owners selling in Amazon’s store to grow their businesses.
We are proud to have created this initiative with our Black 
Employee Network affinity group and strategic partners, including the Minority Business Development Agency and 
the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc., which have deep experience 
in supporting Black businesses. 
As part of the Accelerator, we also introduced a 12-month 
mentorship and networking benefit called BBA Connect to 
provide ongoing support for entrepreneurs. 
“ The opportunity to connect with people 
inside Amazon to continue to help us mature 
our capabilities is super validating but also 
extremely rewarding. With Amazon’s support, 
the sky really feels like it’s the limit.”

Our Communities
We are committed to promoting people in our communities 
who come from historically underrepresented communities. 
For example, at Whole Foods Market, our Inclusive Product 
Strategy expands our existing partnerships with brands 
that are owned and operated by women, members of the 
LGBTQ+ community, and people of color. As part of this 
strategy, we spotlight one supplier per month across internal 
communications channels. Select supplier spotlights from 
2021 include:
• Shea Radiance , a Black- and women-owned beauty brand 
whose shea butter is sourced directly from women-run 
cooperatives to create economic access through trade.
• Undefined Beauty , a Black-, women-, and LGBTQ+-owned 
business that delivers innovative and high-quality products 
at an accessible price point.
• Pop & Bottle , a women-operated and -owned, plant-
based bottled coffee business founded by two new mothers 
with an interest in wellness.
Another example is our continued commitment to the 
Amazon Literary Partnership (ALP) —a grant program 
founded in 2009 that funds organizations championing 
diverse, marginalized, and underrepresented authors and 
storytellers. In 2021, ALP awarded 80 grants totaling more 
than $1 million to organizations across the country that 
support writers and underrepresented voices. $21 Million Program for Real Estate
Developers of Color 
Addressing the housing crisis starts with removing barriers. 
In 2021, we announced an accelerator program to help real 
estate developers of color kick-start their projects through 
the Amazon Housing Equity Fund. The $21 million, two-year, 
part-time professional development program aims to help real 
estate developers of color progress in an industry known for 
high barriers to entry. We partnered with local social impact 
and economic justice organizations to develop curriculums and 
networking opportunities that reflect the specific issues facing 
their communities.
We also partner with Enterprise Community Loan Fund, 
Inc. to administer grants of up to $200,000 to qualified real 
estate developers of color. These grants are open to anyone 
who applies to the Amazon Housing Equity Fund and needs 
assistance with the capacity-building and pre-development 
expenses associated with the preservation and creation of 
affordable housing within Amazon’s three focus regions.

Employee 
Engagement: 
Listening to  
Our People
With more than 1.6 million direct 
employees worldwide, employee 
engagement is fundamental to our 
success. Our goal is to hear from and 
listen to all of our employees. We have 
a variety of engagement, feedback, 
and remediation mechanisms that 
help us continually improve our 
workplace experience. Open-Door Philosophy
We believe candid and constructive communication in 
an environment of mutual respect is essential to our 
collective success. Our open-door philosophy means 
we welcome and encourage any employee to discuss 
suggestions, concerns, or feedback with their manager, 
a Human Resources team member, or any member of 
Amazon’s leadership team. Feedback Mechanisms
We are committed to providing our employees with grievance 
mechanisms and remedial action, regardless of collective 
bargaining presence. We work hard to listen to our employees, 
make continual improvements, and invest heavily to offer 
competitive pay and benefits in a safe and inclusive workplace.
Voice of the Associate Boards
We offer our team members the opportunity to express 
themselves openly. For our associates, our Voice of the 
Associate (VOA) boards and their digital counterpart, 
MyVoice, are available at Amazon facilities around the globe. 
These give employees a forum for expressing their concerns, 
offering suggestions, and asking questions on a daily basis. 
Leadership teams reply directly, promoting dialogue and 
efficient remediation of issues. In 2021, Amazon managers 
received and responded to more than 210,000 submissions.
Connections
Connections is a real-time, companywide employee feedback 
mechanism, designed to listen to and learn from employees 
at scale to improve the employee experience. Each day, 
Connections questions are delivered to every Amazon 
employee on a computer, workstation device, or hand 
scanner, generating more than 1.5 million daily responses 
from employees. 
Employees can choose to respond to a question or not, 
and individual responses are aggregated and shared with 
managers at the team level to maintain confidentiality. 
Connections analyzes response data and provides insights 
to managers and leaders to review and take actions as 
necessary. Employees respond to Connections questions in 
55 countries, and questions are delivered in 26 languages. 210K+
Suggestions, questions, 
and comments addressed 
through VOA boardsAppeals Process
We believe that everyone deserves to have their voice heard, 
including when appealing any decisions. In the U.S. and 
Canada, Amazon offers an online, paperless appeals process, 
through which eligible employees can challenge certain 
disciplinary actions. The appeals may involve a review from 
a second-level manager or general manager to verify that 
policies have been applied correctly. If this is not found to be 
the case, we remediate as appropriate.
Ethical Behavior
While working, our employees should always act lawfully, 
ethically, and in the best interests of Amazon. Our Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics  (Code of Conduct) sets out 
basic guiding principles for all employees. Employees may 
raise questions or report suspected violations of our Code of 
Conduct through Amazon’s Ethics Line, by phone or online. 
Ethics Line
The Ethics Line is a commonly utilized method for employees 
to raise concerns, offered in 165 languages and 63 countries. 
Reports to the Ethics Line are answered by an independent 
third party and may be made anonymously on request. Our 
Business Conduct and Ethics team records, reviews, investigates 
(or directs others to investigate), and reports alleged violations 
of the Code of Conduct, tracking any remediation required.
We take all allegations of unlawful conduct in the workplace 
extremely seriously. We carefully review and investigate 
allegations of unlawful conduct or other conduct that violates 
any of our policies. In addition, we will not allow retaliation 
against an employee for reporting misconduct by others in 
good faith. Our senior leadership team receives regular updates 
on any allegations of unlawful harassment and discrimination 1.5M+ 
Responses every day to 
Connections questions in 
26 languages in 55 countriesagainst employees in director-level positions or above and is 
kept apprised of the progress and findings of our investigations. 
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee 
of the Board of Directors, comprising independent directors, 
receives detailed quarterly updates on any allegations 
of unlawful harassment and discrimination against 
employees in vice-president-level positions or above or 
employees investigated on behalf of Amazon by an external 
investigator. Upon completion of each investigation, we take 
appropriate action against anyone found to have engaged in 
unlawful conduct or to have violated our policies.

Engaging Our Employees
We value employee feedback. We believe it is in the best 
interests of our employees and our company to continue 
our direct communications, and that the best way to effect 
positive change is for our employees and managers to 
continue working together directly.
We encourage our employees to provide feedback regularly. 
Employees have daily opportunities to engage with leaders, 
raise issues, and make suggestions to continually improve 
our workplace through all-hands meetings with general 
managers, stand-up meetings with direct supervisors, and 
one-on-one meetings.
Associate Roundtables
The purpose of Associate Roundtable meetings is to provide 
leaders and associates with meaningful opportunities to 
discuss issues. Leaders hear directly from hourly associates, 
who can ask questions about any topic and share thoughts 
about their job, work environment, and any challenges they 
might be facing. The leadership team uses the information 
to improve the workplace and the associate experience.Associate Forums
Amazon has dozens of Associate Forums in Europe and 
Africa that enable employees to regularly interact directly 
with their site leadership teams. Associate Forums consist 
of site leadership and representatives elected by workplace 
employees who meet regularly to share information, 
feedback, and ideas. This gives associates and leaders at the 
site an opportunity to consult directly on key decisions that 
affect the site or associate experience, including working 
practices, shift schedules, and associate well-being.
Associate Safety Committees 
Another way Amazon obtains feedback and input from 
employees is through Associate Safety Committees. 
These committees exist at many sites around the world, 
including in jurisdictions or states in the U.S. where they 
are not legally mandated. Practices Related to Freedom of
Association and Collective Bargaining
We respect freedom of association and our employees’ 
right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other 
lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of 
reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. These rights should be 
exercised in an informed and thoughtful manner. Amazon 
has a variety of elected associate forums and work councils 
around the world, and we have associates represented by 
some form of collective bargaining in many countries.We value worker feedback, and are committed to 
providing our employees with grievance mechanisms 
and remedial action, regardless of collective bargaining 
presence. We firmly believe it is in the best interests of 
our employees and our company to continue our direct 
communications, and that the best way to effect positive 
change is for our employees and managers to continue 
working together directly. We work hard to listen to our 
employees, make continual improvements, and invest 
heavily to offer competitive pay and benefits in a safe 
and inclusive workplace.

Safety, Health, 
and Well-Being 
at Amazon
Safety is integral to everything we 
do at Amazon, and we strive to be 
safer every day for our employees, 
partners, and communities. Our 
work environments allow our 
employees, regardless of background, 
skill level, or experience, to work 
with confidence. Our Approach 
We structure our operations to fulfill customer orders as 
efficiently and safely as possible, and work to optimize our 
processes, equipment, and facilities for safety and productivity. 
We provide extensive safety training, coaching, and 
engagement opportunities to our operations employees to 
continually improve workplace safety. We employ thousands 
of safety professionals to solve complex problems, maintain 
safety equipment, and establish new industry best practices. 
We continually identify opportunities to innovate and invest 
in achieving better outcomes and solutions for our people. 
These range from integrating new safety technology, 
such as vehicle safety controls for our delivery network, 
to engineering ergonomic solutions for employees in our 
fulfillment centers. We continue to research, invest, and 
apply data and insights to improve safety in our workplaces.Prioritizing Safety From Day 1
From an employee’s first day at Amazon, we highlight and 
reinforce the importance of safety through our new-hire 
orientation program, which details safety expectations 
and policies. Helping employees understand how to use 
the equipment and processes designed to keep them safe 
through training opportunities—such as microlearning, just-
in-time training, and learning by doing—is a top priority. This 
provides our staff with the chance to build safety skills and 
competencies on an ongoing basis. We provide continual 
training on topics such as body mechanics and fall hazards 
through routine reminders, alerts when logging on to a 
workstation, and messages in our mobile app for employees. 
Every operations manager also participates in annual 
safety training, reinforcing basic concepts like emergency 
preparedness and hazard identification. Smart Tech for Smarter Work
We use technology to help reduce physical demands on our 
employees. For example, we provide our fulfillment center 
employees with intelligent, wearable safety items that can 
communicate with robotic equipment in real time. We also 
have mobile and vehicle technology to help drivers perform 
pickups, deliveries, and returns efficiently and safely. We 
are constantly evaluating new opportunities and learning 
programs to create innovative solutions in technology, 
robotics, and automation that improve safety across 
our operations. 
One major area of focus is using technology to advance 
driver-centric customization throughout our delivery fleet 
and bringing safety to the forefront of vehicle design. We 
are investing an incremental $100 million across our fleet in 
2022 to bring innovations in ergonomics and driver assistance 
technologies. All Amazon-branded delivery vehicles are 
equipped with driver safety and comfort features, including 
active systems like automatic emergency braking, technologies 
that improve visibility, and alerts for nearby vehicles. 
In 2021, we piloted our custom electric delivery van, built 
in partnership with Rivian, in over 15 U.S. cities. These vans 
are designed with the human body in mind, and include 
12 advanced driver assistance features that consider 
the safety and comfort needs of our drivers. We are also 
collaborating with drivers to develop vehicle improvements 
based on their feedback. Safety at a Glance:

for employees. We wanted to make 
sure it’s not only easy to use but also 
beneficial, whether someone is starting 
their health and wellness journey or 
continuing their safety education.”
Chandni Chandihok  
Workplace Health and Safety Product  
Manager, AmazonHow Technology Is Making Roads Safer 
In 2021, thousands of drivers navigated over 2 billion miles 
delivering packages to our customers around the world. As 
our transportation businesses have expanded, we’ve focused 
on making our roads safer for our drivers and communities 
through innovative mobile and vehicle technology. 
Artificial intelligence reduces accidents by capturing data 
and providing real-time alerts for unsafe driving behavior, 
such as driver distraction, close following distance, stop sign 
and signal violations, and seatbelt infractions. Our 2021 
investment of more than $130 million in new transportation 
safety technology and programs resulted in nearly 50% 
fewer accidents since October 2020, and we are investing 
an incremental $100 million in 2022 to scale innovations in 
ergonomics and driver assistance technologies across our 
delivery fleet. Boosting Wellness and Well-Being 
When people are given the tools to take care of their 
well-being at work and at home, they are not only less 
prone to injuries but they feel better, healthier, and happier. 
We proactively help employees manage their health and 
wellness through a wide range of programs. We also provide 
access to convenient health care through our Neighborhood 
Health Centers , with 17 facilities located near fulfillment 
centers in the U.S. as of 2021.
Our innovative WorkingWell program uses academic 
research and certified athletic trainers to educate new 
employees about their bodies, health, and wellness to help 
them successfully adapt to working at Amazon. After the 
onboarding phase, WorkingWell continues to provide support 
to employees through Huddles, which are meetings among 
small groups of employees covering topics such as training, 
conditioning, bending, and handling objects. These regular 
connections provide opportunities to discuss the benefits of 
strong body mechanics and provide ongoing safety education.
We also provide short activities called Mind and Body 
Moments, which appear on workstation screens at sites 
across North America, South America, India, and Europe. 
These messages encourage employees to take regular breaks 
to stretch, breathe, and be mindful. The goal is to improve 
employees’ mental and physical well-being, reduce fatigue 
and stress, and improve health and safety engagement.“  As a driver, I feel protected and safer 
with Amazon’s technology. If something 
happens, the footage is there to help 
me. Alerts provide a level of safety 
that wasn’t there before, helping me 
consciously think about safety—even 
after my shift ends when I’m driving 
my own vehicle.”

Building a Supply 
Chain That Puts 
People First
Amazon is committed to 
conducting our business in a 
lawful and responsible manner, 
including engaging with suppliers 
that respect human rights, provide 
safe and inclusive workplaces, and 
promote a sustainable future.Our Approach 
Our goal is for our products and services to be provided in a 
way that respects human rights and the environment. Our 
global teams work closely with suppliers to communicate 
our standards and help suppliers build their capacity to 
provide working environments that are safe and respectful 
of  human rights.
Supply Chain Standards
We set a high bar for ourselves and our suppliers. Amazon’s 
Supply Chain Standards  detail the requirements and 
expectations for our suppliers, their supply chains, and selling 
partners that list products in our stores. They are grounded 
in principles of inclusivity, continuous improvement, and 
supply chain accountability. We engage with suppliers that 
are committed to these same principles, and suppliers 
commit to these standards as a condition of doing business 
with us. At least every three years, in line with industry best 
practices, we review our Supply Chain Standards against 
policies developed by industry associations. Additionally, 
we review these standards in consultation with human rights 
experts and organizations, including Business for Social 
Responsibility (BSR), Impactt Limited, International Center 
for Research on Women, Nest, Responsible Business Alliance 
(RBA), and UN Women.
Supply Chain Risk Assessments
We evaluate our supply chain to understand the highest 
risks to workers and to prioritize our efforts. To do this, 
we engage key internal and external stakeholders, analyze 
our risks using international risk indices such as the World 
Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators, run worker surveys, 
and conduct assessments that include worker interviews, 
management interviews, document reviews, and on-site 
visits. We regularly consult industry experts to review our approach to risk assessment against globally recognized 
international standards and industry best practices.
We conduct regular assessments of suppliers of Amazon-
branded products, including Amazon Private Brands and 
Amazon devices, as well as a curated selection of brands 
exclusively sold in Amazon’s store. We expect our suppliers 
to consistently monitor and enforce our standards in 
their own operations and supply chain, as well as making 
improvements to meet or exceed our expectations.
Continuous Improvement 
Our approach is based on a commitment to workers and to 
continuous improvement. We put the safety and interests 
of workers first and work to strengthen suppliers’ capacities 
to manage and mitigate risks in their value chains. We have 
dedicated teams in key sourcing regions that engage directly 
with suppliers and their workers. If an issue is found, we work 
with suppliers to remediate the issue by prioritizing worker 
feedback and offering suppliers resources to help them invest 
in worker well-being and safe workplaces. Teams across the 
company set goals with senior leadership to track progress 
and incentivize improvement across our supply chain.
Top Five Sourcing 
Countries in 2021
China, India, Japan, United Kingdom, United StatesLearn more about our Responsible Sourcing Program, 
including our Supply Chain Standards, our Supplier Manual, 
and our supply chain map, on our website . Selling Partners
Selling partners are third-party sellers and retail vendors 
that offer products for sale in Amazon’s stores. Our 
Supply Chain Standards apply to every product sold in our 
stores and we expect selling partners to do their own due 
diligence in support of producing every product in safe, 
healthy, and inclusive work environments. 
We evaluate credible allegations of selling partner 
violations of our Supply Chain Standards including, but 
not limited to, those published by governments, civil 
society, reputable investigators, journalists, or human 
rights defenders. If we have reason to suspect certain 
products do not meet our standards, we may request 
that the selling partner demonstrate the products it 
sells in our store were manufactured in accordance with 
Amazon’s Supply Chain Standards, such as providing 
evidence of auditing protocols, showing processes 
for assessing factory working conditions, engaging 
in unannounced audits, participating in an approved 
industry association that includes factory monitoring, 
or verifying where the products are made.

Our Progress in 2021 
In 2021, we strengthened our engagement with suppliers, 
workers, and communities to further embed respect for 
human rights throughout our value chain. We are building our 
efforts in our key commitment areas, including Gender Equity 
and Responsible Recruitment, and strengthened our due 
diligence mechanisms. Workers remain at the center of our 
work; we support our suppliers to mitigate risk and invest in 
supply chain worker well-being. 
Supply Chain Commitments
We evaluate our supply chain to identify the industries, 
countries, and issues where we have the greatest opportunities 
to identify and address risks and have a positive impact on 
workers. We work closely with our suppliers around the world, 
and consistently work to identify partnerships and programs 
to help our suppliers invest in worker well-being and safe 
workplaces. We are proud to share our progress on our key 
commitment areas. 
Learn more about our key supply chain commitment  
areas on our website .
Safe and Healthy Workplaces
Maintaining safe and healthy workplaces is a top priority for 
Amazon. We have global teams who partner with suppliers to 
increase worker awareness of safety issues, promote worker 
participation in their facility’s safety culture, and promote 
initiatives focused on the well-being of workers on issues that 
matter most to them.Supply Chain Transparency
Supply chain transparency is essential to our approach 
to human rights due diligence, and an important tool 
to help us address risks in our supply chain and identify 
opportunities for collaboration on systemic supply 
chain issues. We publish a supplier list and interactive 
supply chain map that provides details on suppliers of 
Amazon-branded apparel, consumer electronics, food 
and beverage, and home goods products. We update our 
supply chain map at least annually to provide customers 
and external stakeholders visibility into where we source. 
We also contribute lists of our apparel suppliers  to the 
Open Apparel Registry to foster brand collaboration and 
action in the apparel industry.  
 
 “  I feel proud to be a part of the program 
under Swasti. Before the training, I was 
not very conscious of my health. I have 
not been eating well in the morning. The 
training helped me to understand how 
to address symptoms I was experiencing 
and counseled me on ways to manage 
through healthy lifestyle and exercise. 
The easy accessibility to the health 
counselor and nutritionist helped 
me gradually control and improve 
my symptoms.” 
T. N. Manjula 
Supervisor at Just Jute Products and participant in  
Swasti health training Learn more about our supply chain map  
and list on our website .In 2021, we continued to strengthen our mechanisms to 
address and improve workplace safety by conducting building, 
electrical, and fire safety assessments for at-risk suppliers in 
Bangladesh and Pakistan. We also trained selected suppliers 
on how to improve management systems and workplace 
dialogue, and we created issue-specific guidebooks to enable 
suppliers to better understand the root causes of these issues 
and help prevent issues from occurring. 
We expanded our work with the Sustaining Competitive 
and Responsible Enterprises (SCORE) program, a lean 
manufacturing program focused on improving productivity 
and safe working conditions in small and medium-sized 
manufacturers, with an emphasis on worker participation 
as an essential component to strong safety management 
practices. To date, we have enrolled 50 suppliers located in 
India, China, and Vietnam, providing over 28,900 workers with 
a cumulative 8,800 hours of training. Through an independent 
assessment of the program, we found a reduction in health 
and safety findings and accidents, and increased productivity 
and worker satisfaction. 
To provide programs to workers in our supply chain, we 
partner with Swasti, a global nonprofit committed to ensuring 
access to quality health care for workers in marginalized 
communities. As of 2021, Swasti reached over 1,200 workers 
in Amazon’s supply chain in India, providing critical mental 
health, health care, and social entitlement support to workers, 
their families, and their communities. Swasti provides a 
telecare health counseling program, factory management 
training on COVID-19 prevention and management, 
and screening for harmful health conditions, including 
hypertension and diabetes.

Protecting Workers During COVID-19
Millions of workers worldwide remain affected by 
deepening poverty, inequality, and job uncertainty due to 
the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In many 
parts of Asia, which are critical manufacturing and sourcing 
regions for Amazon’s goods, workers continue to experience 
health and financial challenges due to low vaccination rates 
and reoccurring lockdowns, which can shutter factories.
Building on our 2020 investments in organizations providing 
critical front-line support to workers impacted by the 
pandemic, in 2021, we made an additional $1.65 million 
investment to collaborate with several organizations and 
invest directly in suppliers of Amazon-branded products. 
This investment will help provide an estimated 54,000 workers with access to crisis response resources, with a focus 
on Asia’s most COVID-vulnerable regions. 
Through a collaboration with Catalyst Management 
Services, a social investment specialist group, and PATH, 
a global public health nonprofit, this commitment will 
facilitate vaccine assistance, provide a medical hotline 
for workers and their families, and assist factories in 
establishing crisis response plans. Additionally, we continue 
our collaboration with Nest to provide tools and training 
to help more than 70 artisan small business owners in 
Indonesia, Cambodia, and the Philippines weather the 
financial impact of shop closures, staffing shortages, 
and canceled orders. 
 Learn more about our human rights partnerships .Gender Equity
Gender equity is a fundamental human right and a necessary 
foundation of a sustainable supply chain. Quality jobs for 
women translate to positive impacts for communities, and 
we are actively working to empower women to make their 
own decisions on health, finances, and career development. 
In 2021, we scaled our work and investments to advance 
the rights of female workers in supply chains. We made a 
$1 million investment in the Resilience Fund for Women in 
Global Value Chains. The Resilience Fund pools corporate 
investments to drive local, women-led solutions to some of 
the toughest problems facing women in global value chains. 
Established by BSR, the UN Foundation, and Women Win, 
the Resilience Fund aims to raise at least $10 million to 
make strategic, long-term investments in women’s economic 
resilience, health, and well-being.
Learn more on About Amazon .We worked with International Center for Research on 
Women (ICRW) Advisors and The Mara Partners to advance 
women’s rights across our global value chain, and joined 
Better Cotton’s Working Group on Decent Work & Gender 
to improve working conditions for cotton farmers. 
In addition, we signed and adopted the UN Women’s 
Empowerment Principles (WEPs) . Supported by more than 
6,000 corporate signatories, the WEPs were established by

Amazon Partnership With Nest
To advance our gender equity commitments, we support 
female business leaders, entrepreneurs, and makers across 
our supply chain. As part of this effort, in 2021, Amazon 
Handmade and Nest teamed up to support artisan and maker 
businesses to increase their sales and impact by leveraging 
the power of Amazon’s marketplace. Nest, a nonprofit 
supporting the responsible growth and creative engagement 
of the artisan and maker economy to drive gender equity, 
supports a growing network of over 1,600 artisan businesses 
across 120 countries. The partnership between Nest and 
Amazon Handmade led to the launch of a dedicated cohort 
of Nest artisan businesses that were promoted through a 
dedicated gateway on Amazon Handmade.In the wake of COVID-19, providing artisan businesses with 
a multichannel sales strategy is essential to their resilience 
and ability to withstand unprecedented times for small 
maker businesses. For example, Espacio Handmade, based in 
Austin, Texas, is a women-owned leather goods business that 
was highlighted in our 2020 Sustainability Report. Amazon 
Handmade also featured the business in the “Our Favorite 
Finds” section, and within weeks, Espacio Handmade had 
received hundreds of orders. Amazon Handmade is proud to 
support creative maker and artisan businesses as they navigate 
optimal ways to leverage the direct-to-consumer platform that 
both Amazon and Amazon Handmade provide. 
Gender Equity Training for Workers 
in Our Supply Chain
Amazon partners with BSR’s HERproject, an initiative 
that brings together global brands, their suppliers, and 
local partners to create and implement workplace-based 
interventions on health, financial inclusion, and respect for 
women’s rights. Through our BSR partnership, we engage 
suppliers in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. As of 
2021, we supported nearly 16,000 workers—including 
10,000 women—with trainings on health and financial 
skills, and we helped workers and factory management to 
combat gender-based discrimination in the workplace.
Sunita Giri is a garment worker at Dhruv Globals Ltd. 
in India who attended a HERfinance program. She is a single mother of two children, and her family depends on 
her income alone. Through HERfinance training, Sunita 
learned the value of investing and saving for health and 
future expenses. The training taught her about financial 
planning tools and options to build her savings to support 
her short-term and long-term goals. It also inspired her to 
open a savings account, where she regularly deposits funds, 
and enabled her to use digital payment tools that support 
fair wage payments. Sunita shared what she learned with 
her colleagues, family, and neighbors, so that they also 
benefited from the information she received. 
“It is because of this training that I have 
started to think about myself and my future, 
as I do not want to depend on anyone [in] my 
old age,” she said.Learn more on About Amazon .

Responsible Recruitment and Freely 
Chosen Employment 
Amazon does not tolerate the use of forced labor. Forced 
labor is a hidden crime that is hard to combat, and workplace 
environments and recruitment practices are dynamic. For 
vulnerable groups such as foreign migrant workers, we are 
increasing our understanding of forced labor risk across both 
home and destination countries. Worker voice mechanisms 
are important to enable workers to raise issues in a safe 
and confidential manner. We recognize real progress in this 
space will only be achieved through collaborative action—
by companies, governments, and civil society—to spur 
systemwide change. 
With operations and supply chains spanning the globe, we 
are committed to improving the working conditions of people 
who are connected to our business and recognize the need 
to monitor for conditions that put workers at risk of modern 
slavery. We work to identify and reduce the risk of forced 
labor. Our Supply Chain Standards prohibit all forms of forced 
labor and human trafficking, and set requirements aimed at 
reducing risk. For example, workers must not be required to 
pay recruitment fees, and suppliers must not retain passports 
or personal documentation. During assessments of Amazon-
branded suppliers, we track where workers migrated from and 
how much they paid in recruitment fees. If fees have been paid, 
we require the supplier to reimburse workers in full. In 2021, we expanded our relationships with key external 
partners RBA and the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM). We also began partnering with the Issara Institute to 
address issues of human trafficking and forced labor through 
worker voice, partnership, and innovation. We are working with 
these organizations to better understand hotspots across our 
supply chain so that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced 
labor continue to be respected and promoted. We are also 
working with them to leverage collective industry responses for 
improved due diligence and develop impactful risk mitigation 
strategies that put the interests of workers first.
Additionally, we expanded our training on responsible 
recruitment practices to over 50 suppliers through the RBA’s 
Responsible Labor Initiative and IOM. We also offered worker 
awareness training to workers at sites in high-risk regions to 
improve the well-being of foreign migrant workers. These 
training programs focused on modern slavery risks and the 
importance of responsible recruitment, including teaching 
participants how to implement effective risk mitigation 
controls, identify issues in their recruitment and hiring processes 
for migrant workers, and draft an implementation plan for 
addressing these issues. Standing in Partnership Against  
Child Labor
The UN designated 2021 as International Year for the 
Elimination of Child Labour. Building on our work with 
The Centre for Child Rights and Business, Amazon 
committed to the Joint Action Pledge to strengthen 
the protection of children’s rights and accelerate 
action to address child labor in global supply chains. 
Through this commitment, we will work with other 
retailers to further extend due diligence, remediation, 
and monitoring activities. This will enable us to 
increase our understanding of child labor in supply 
chains, deliver programs to support juvenile workers, 
build the capabilities of suppliers to address child labor, 
work collaboratively as a group to share learnings, and 
establish best practices to address child labor.
“  Amazon is committed to ensuring our 
products and services are provided in 
a way that respects human rights, and 
combating forced and child labor in 
global supply chains is an important part 
of that pledge. In this International Year 
for the Elimination of Child Labour, we 
are proud to reinforce our commitment by 
joining the Joint Action Pledge and look 
forward to working collaboratively with 
The Centre for Child Rights and Business, 
peer companies, and other stakeholders 
to strengthen protections for children’s 
rights and eliminate child labor.” 
Leigh Anne DeWine  
Director of Social Responsibility, AmazonFair Wages 
We are committed to working closely with suppliers, business 
partners, and multistakeholder associations to monitor and 
promote continual improvement in working conditions, 
including fair and on-time payment of wages. We have 
dedicated teams across the globe that work directly with 
suppliers to track and report performance against these 
standards. Our suppliers are required to pay legally required 
compensation, including overtime and benefits, and we 
encourage them to continually evaluate whether their 
workers earn enough to meet their basic needs and the 
needs of their families.
Making sure workers are paid fairly is a challenge across 
all industries in global supply chains. We are working to 
better understand wage payments in our supply chain to 
meaningfully engage with suppliers and enhance our due 
diligence under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights on this issue. We will continue to enroll our 
suppliers in international programs that improve livelihoods, 
help suppliers invest in worker well-being, and contribute 
to the social and economic development of regions where 
we source and operate. Programs such as SCORE and 
Better Work address the holistic challenges workers face by 
focusing on improving working conditions and promoting 
respect for labor rights. An independent impact assessment 
of the SCORE program found increased productivity and 
increased wages for Amazon suppliers participating in 
the program.

• Tech Against Trafficking is a coalition of companies 
collaborating with global experts to help eradicate 
human trafficking using technology. Amazon sits on the 
organization’s steering committee and has leveraged 
the expertise and resources of AWS to help explore and 
scale the use of technology solutions across the anti-
trafficking field. 
• Thorn, an organization that builds technology to defend 
children from sexual abuse, leverages AWS machine learning 
tools in its Spotlight product. Spotlight’s sophisticated 
machine learning capabilities save time for investigators by 
automatically flagging ads likely to represent victims of child 
sex trafficking. Investigators search Spotlight’s constantly 
growing database of ads and set up automated alerts to 
empower proactive investigations. Spotlight has helped 
identify more than 20,000 child sex trafficking victims.
• Amazon is an official corporate sponsor of Truckers 
Against Trafficking (TAT), an organization dedicated to 
combating human trafficking in the trucking industry. We 
began incorporating TAT training modules into trainings for 
our internal fleet of drivers to teach them how to identify 
and respond to potential victims of human trafficking. Since 
launching this partnership, we have trained over 9,000 
Amazon transportation associates.
• We support the UK-wide Modern Slavery & Exploitation 
Helpline operated by Unseen, investing in its efforts to 
provide immediate and long-term assistance to potential 
victims of modern slavery and to ensure the helpline’s 
continued growth. The helpline provides direct response and 
services to potential victims of modern slavery and helps 
shape trainings and wider services for vulnerable people.Combating Forced Labor
Amazon is currently working with these organizations to 
devise holistic approaches to combating forced labor:
• Amazon supports Polaris, a nonprofit leading a social 
justice movement to fight sex and labor trafficking at the 
massive scale of the problem—25 million people worldwide 
deprived of the freedom to choose how they live and work. 
Through the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, Polaris 
has responded to more than 73,000 situations of human 
trafficking since 2007. AWS works with Polaris to infuse 
cutting-edge technology into its infrastructure to accelerate 
the development of the largest known U.S. dataset on 
trafficking. With the guidance of survivors, Polaris uses 
that data to improve the way trafficking is identified, how 
victims and survivors are assisted, and how communities, 
businesses, and governments can prevent human trafficking 
by transforming the underlying inequities and oppressions 
that make it possible.
• Amazon is a member of the Responsible Labor Initiative, 
a multi-industry, multistakeholder initiative focused on 
ensuring that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced 
labor in global supply chains are consistently respected 
and promoted. 
• Amazon partners with StolenYouth, a Seattle-based 
organization with the mission to end child sex trafficking 
in the state of Washington through prevention, connecting 
trafficked youth to resources and services, and empowering 
survivors along their path to recovery and a promising 
future. We support StolenYouth by providing both financial 
support and goods donations.

Environmental Protection
We are committed to sourcing products and services that do 
not cause unnecessary environmental harm, and work with 
industry experts on ways to understand the environmental 
impact of our products. We are a member of the Sustainable 
Apparel Coalition, an industrywide group of leading apparel 
and footwear brands, retailers, manufacturers, NGOs, 
academic experts, and government organizations working 
to reduce the environmental and social impacts of apparel 
products around the world. 
We encourage our Amazon-branded suppliers to evaluate 
their practices using the Coalition’s Higg Index, a tool to 
help manufacturers measure the social and environmental 
performance of their facilities. We are committed to driving 
adoption of this assessment and helping our suppliers 
understand their environmental impacts. Our aim is to work 
with industry partners and our suppliers to understand 
their environmental footprints and set goals to reduce 
environmental impacts. 
Access to Effective Grievance Mechanisms
We are building our efforts to provide people connected 
to our value chain with access to effective grievance 
mechanisms as part of our supply chain due diligence and 
investments in worker well-being, and have added this as 
a key commitment area. 
We help our suppliers work with a number of global partners 
to provide supply chain workers with access to effective 
grievance mechanisms, including the Amader Kotha Helpline 
in Bangladesh; Ulula in China, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, 
and the UK; the amfori SPEAK FOR CHANGE Programme 
in Vietnam; the Responsible Labor Initiative’s Suara Kami 
helpline in Malaysia; and Sedex Direct Worker Reporting 
in India. These organizations are key to helping our suppliers listen 
to their workers and raise awareness of issues in our supply 
chain. We provide our suppliers and service providers with 
these tools in order to help them hear directly from workers 
about their experiences, and to support the resolution 
of issues from the workers’ perspectives. Across these 
mechanisms used in 2021, 92% of closed issues have had 
worker verification of remedial actions.
As an example of our work in this area, we enrolled our 
Bangladeshi suppliers in Amader Kotha, a helpline that 
provides workers in the ready-made garment sector a 
safe and effective way to report and resolve workplace 
issues. We provide ongoing capacity-building to suppliers 
enrolled in Amader Kotha, assisting with grievance handling 
mechanisms and worker voice tools. In our third year of 
working with Amader Kotha, we are seeing significant 
impact. More than 88% of workers employed with our 
Bangladeshi suppliers reported that they were satisfied with 
the usage of the Amader Kotha Helpline. In 2021, workers 
placed 530 calls to the helpline—86% related to labor issues 
and 4.6% related to safety issues. These cases are resolved 
directly in partnership with factory management in line  
with the helpline’s protocols.Commodities and Traceability 
Assessing and Mapping Risk
Commodity supply chains are complicated and fragmented, 
and improved visibility into raw material supply chains better 
enables businesses to identify human rights and labor rights 
violations and hold suppliers accountable. 
In 2021, we completed our first commodity and materiality 
risk assessment for Amazon-branded products and identified 
eight commodities with salient social and environmental risks 
as a key milestone in the development of our responsible 
commodity sourcing roadmap. 
Focus on Cotton 
In 2021, we continued to strengthen our efforts to address 
human rights risks in global cotton supply chains. Amazon 
joined Better Cotton’s Retailer and Brand Advisory Panel 
on Traceability to help steer Better Cotton’s initial vision 
and strategy toward achieving more traceable cotton in 
the coming years. We also participated in the Responsible 
Sourcing Network’s initiative YESS: Yarn Ethically & 
Sustainably Sourced. YESS works to address forced labor 
in the cotton value chain by providing training to, and 
managing the assessment of, spinners and fabric mills to 
identify and address forced labor in cotton production. 
Focus on Minerals 
In 2021, we increased our support for industry collaboration 
toward responsible mineral sourcing. We remain members 
of the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals 
Trade and the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). We also 
enhanced our cobalt due diligence program using the RMI’s 
cobalt reporting template.
We supported RMI’s Smelter Audit Fund to increase 
assessments for tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold smelters. 
These assessments are critical to responsible mineral sourcing in our supply chains. In 2022, we will implement 
additional smelter due diligence protocols as we work toward 
100% of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold mineral smelters 
and refiners in our supply chain being certified using a 
recognized minerals assurance program. 
Purchasing Practices
Supplier feedback on our purchasing practices is important 
in understanding how we can improve supplier relationships 
and understanding our potential impact on human rights in 
our supply chain. In 2021, Amazon partnered with the Better 
Buying Institute to capture anonymous supplier feedback 
on our purchasing practices through an annual survey. 
Benchmarked against industry peers, we identified key areas, 
including planning and forecasting, supplier engagement, 
and on-time payments, where we can improve practices to 
drive a better supplier experience of working with Amazon.
In 2021, Amazon partnered with Better Buying and other 
brands to create an e-learning course to raise awareness 
about the importance of the issue.
We are proud to have been part of the effort to 
end state-imposed forced labor in Uzbekistan’s 
cotton sector. In 2019, Amazon signed the 
Cotton Campaign’s Uzbek Cotton Pledge with 
over 300 brands and retailers to raise awareness 
and oppose the systemic use of forced labor in 
Uzbekistan’s cotton production. As of March 
2022, the International Labour Organization has 
independently verified that the government of 
Uzbekistan has ended the practice of state-imposed 
forced labor in its cotton sector and the Cotton 
Campaign has lifted the Uzbek Cotton Pledge, 
ending the boycott of Uzbek cotton. Learn more about our spotlight on worker voice .

Supplier Assessments
We assess our suppliers of Amazon-branded products 
across four main categories: 1) Labor, 2) Health and Safety, 
3) Environment, and 4) Ethics. These categories are divided 
into subcategories, such as nondiscrimination, emergency 
preparedness, hazardous substances, and transparency. 
Findings within each subcategory are flagged as High, 
Medium, or Low depending on the level of severity. Amazon 
focuses on setting a high bar for new suppliers and refusing 
to go to production until suppliers remediate High-level 
findings identified in our assessments. We recognize that 
some issues may take time to effectively remediate. For 
Medium-level issues, we expect suppliers to show they 
are making meaningful progress toward remediation 
within a defined timeline. For Low-level issues, we monitor 
suppliers for continual improvement. We have dedicated 
teams based in key sourcing countries around the globe 
that work directly with our suppliers to identify solutions to 
challenging problems and promote open dialogue. We seek 
to create long-term relationships with suppliers that align 
with our values and are committed to constantly improving 
conditions. Where we see trends in issues beyond individual 
suppliers, such as widespread health and safety deficits or 
industrywide failures to responsibly protect migrant workers, 
we work to define regional or global strategies to address 
underlying systemic challenges. We share our supplier assessment  data (see Appendix) 
to demonstrate our commitment to transparency and 
contribute to industrywide knowledge on complex and 
changing supply chain conditions. In 2021, we conducted 
5,952 assessments to help us determine which suppliers 
to work with and, for those we do engage, to help us 
understand and continually improve those suppliers’ 
practices. We utilize three types of assessments: 
•  Pre-Production Assessments: Suppliers must submit 
an Amazon-approved assessment of their facilities 
before beginning production of Amazon-branded 
products (28% of assessments conducted in 2021 
were Pre-Production Assessments). 
•  Ongoing Assessments: Suppliers must submit Amazon-
approved assessments on an ongoing basis while producing 
Amazon products (51% of assessments conducted in 2021 
were Ongoing Assessments). 
•  Verification Assessments: Where issues are identified, 
suppliers must develop a corrective action plan detailing 
actions to address identified issues and a long-term 
plan to prevent reoccurrence, and where necessary, 
must undergo a follow-up assessment to remediate 
issues (21% of assessments conducted in 2021 were 
Verification Assessments).Our assessment data reflects findings for suppliers evaluated 
in 2019, 2020, and 2021, and includes assessments of 
suppliers we no longer work with, or with which we never 
began a business relationship. Assessments may have 
found more than one issue listed. We accept assessments 
completed by qualified independent audit firms based 
on our own assessment standards and those of industry 
associations, including Sedex, amfori, and RBA; certification 
standard Social Accountability International (SA8000); and 
the Better Work program. 
Our assessment data helps us determine where to focus our 
efforts and resources, and provides insight into industrywide 
challenges and systemic issues. We are continually innovating 
to include new assessment types and data sources in 
our due diligence program. We attribute the increase in 
transparency issues to the 2021 introduction of a remote Learn more about our supplier assessments .assessment tool, which requires suppliers to provide records 
and documentation in real time. We now provide suppliers 
with additional notice of this expectation to help preempt 
transparency issues. In other cases, the increased rate of 
findings in specific categories represents industrywide 
challenges that require industry-level, long-term solutions. 
We have dedicated teams engaging directly with our 
suppliers on key safety-, wage-, and working hours-related 
findings. We recognize that we cannot address many of these 
systemic issues alone, and we are committed to engaging in 
industry-level interventions in order to drive improvement 
in working conditions. We are dedicated to working with 
our suppliers to understand root causes and build strong 
management systems to address and mitigate issues.

Health Equity for Communities
In 2021, AWS committed $40 million over three years to help 
organizations develop solutions to improve health outcomes 
for underserved or underrepresented communities. The 
program  is open to organizations around the world that 
want to harness AWS technology and expertise to advance 
health equity in any of the following areas:
•  Increasing access to health services for 
underserved communities
•  Reducing disparities by addressing social determinants  
of health
•   Leveraging data to promote more equitable and 
inclusive systems of care 
This program gives organizations another way to access AWS 
credits and technical expertise to advance their missions. 
In collaboration with local nonprofits, AWS also launched 
community development initiatives in villages adjoining AWS 
infrastructure sites in West Java, Indonesia, and Telangana, 
India. Initiatives include renovation of schools, provision of 
clean water facilities, toilets, waste management systems, 
hyperlocal environmental initiatives, and skill development 
programs for local youth.

program, we work alongside governments, nonprofits, 
international aid organizations, and private entities. We offer 
support through cloud computing technology, technical 
expertise, and volunteer time to help communities at every 
stage of a disaster lifecycle.In addition, we provide support and financial assistance, 
often in the form of grants, to employees and partners 
facing unexpected hardship. In 2021, we provided more 
than 19,000 grants, totaling $14 million, for natural disaster 
relief, including hardship due to a COVID-19 diagnosis or 
quarantine. We also supported nearly 1,800 employees, 
partners, and their families with nearly 100,000 essential 
items, nearly 17,000 hot meals, and critical personal services 
such as housing, transportation, and counseling.

Relief Planning
To enable an even faster response to natural disasters, 
we opened our first disaster relief hub in our Atlanta 
fulfillment center in 2021—a major advancement in 
disaster relief planning. 
It can take multiple days to respond to a natural disaster 
and assess, procure, consolidate, and pack supplies. To 
accelerate this process, Amazon analyzed data across four 
years of support to prepare ahead of hurricane season in 
the U.S. and Caribbean. 
We donated and pre-stocked over 500,000 relief 
supplies in our hub, which spans 10,000 cubic feet—
big enough to fill an Amazon Air 767 cargo plane. This 
preparation ensured readiness for helping six of Amazon’s 
humanitarian relief partners, and the hub was instrumental 
in providing support to Louisiana communities following 
Hurricane Ida. 
“  Amazon’s donation of critical relief supplies 
and advance pre-positioning efforts allow 
the American Red Cross to stand ready to 
help at a moment’s notice. We’re honored 
to count Amazon as one of our most valued 
partners and are grateful for their continued 
support to fulfill our mission.”

The AWS Infrastructure Community Engagement Program  
(AWS InCommunities) forges local relationships and creates community-
focused programs where AWS builds, operates, and is expanding our 
physical infrastructure. AWS InCommunities focuses on four key pillars:
1. STEM/STEAM (STEM + arts) education, equity, and access
2. Local tech upskilling
3. Environmental stewardship
4. Employee engagement
In addition, AWS InCommunities’ Signature Programs use AWS’ unique 
resources to develop or inspire future builders from underrepresented 
and underserved communities. These include Girls’ Tech Day, AWS 
Tech Week, Family Tech Series, and Think Big Space.Skills Training and STEM 
Education Programs 
Amazon believes in the power of education to unlock 
human potential, which is why we are investing in a range 
of subjects and tools to help children, higher education 
students, and adults tap into their potential.
Skills training and STEM education can have a big impact 
in an increasingly digitized, technological world, and we 
are helping people pursue careers of the future through 
computer science and coding skills. In 2020, we pledged to 
help 29 million people around the world grow their technical 
skills with free cloud computing skills training by 2025. To 
support this commitment, we have a number of initiatives, 
ranging from equipping higher education institutions with 
a free, ready-to-teach cloud curriculum to helping teachers 
bring coding classes to rural areas, and inspiring girls and 
young women to pursue careers in tech. Our programs 
include Amazon Future Engineer , AWS Training and 
Certification , AWS re/Start , AWS Academy , AWS 
Educate , AWS Think Big Experience , our partnership 
with Girls in Tech , and AWS GetIT .
For example, Amazon Future Engineer is our global 
childhood-to-career computer science program created 
to inspire and educate thousands of students each year 
from underserved and underrepresented communities. As 
part of this program, students explore computer science 
by meeting actual Amazon employees in virtual live career 
talks or explorations of our real-world innovations. In 2021, 
Amazon Future Engineer reached 1.8 million students, and 
it is now available in the U.S., the UK, India, France, Germany, 
and Canada.Amazon Future Engineer also awards 250 students in 
the U.S. each year with $40,000 scholarships and paid 
internships at Amazon, as well as honoring Teacher of the 
Year Award winners with more than $30,000 for themselves 
and their schools. 
Through Amazon Future Engineer, Amazon announced a 
new Advanced Placement Computer Science programming 
curriculum , in partnership with Code.org. Designed with 
equity at its core, the curriculum is intended to empower 
every student, regardless of their background, to envision 
themselves using computer science to bring their dreams 
to life.
AWS launched a $10 million scholarship program  to 
prepare underrepresented and underserved students 
globally for careers in machine learning. In addition, the 
AWS InCommunities Scholarship Program  offers a 
total of $100,000 in scholarships to students from U.S. 
states where AWS has data center operations to support 
their higher education ambitions in STEM. The program 
is open to students enrolling in courses such as electrical 
and electronics engineering, computer science, artificial 
intelligence, biochemistry, software engineering, and 
physics. Since 2019, AWS has awarded 120 scholarships 
to students across four U.S. states.1.8M

Housing Equity 
We believe that all people should have access to housing 
they can afford. In January 2021, Amazon launched 
the Amazon Housing Equity Fund , a commitment of 
over $2 billion to preserve and create more than 20,000 
affordable homes in three communities where we have a 
high concentration of employees: Washington state’s Puget 
Sound region; Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Virginia; and 
Nashville, Tennessee. 
The Housing Equity Fund helps create inclusive housing 
developments and preserve existing housing through 
low-rate loans and grants to community-based 
organizations, mission-driven housing providers, traditional 
and nontraditional public agencies, and minority-
led organizations. 
As of March 2022, the Amazon Housing Equity Fund had 
a significant, positive impact on rental affordability in 
communities Amazon calls home, with more than $1.2 billion 
in loans and grants committed. These commitments have 
preserved or created over 8,000 affordable units to house 
more than 18,000 people. $1.2B+

Corporate 
Governance
Amazon’s Board of Directors is 
responsible for the control and 
direction of Amazon. The Board 
represents the shareholders, and 
its primary purpose is to build  
long-term shareholder value.Board Leadership and Risk Oversight
Amazon’s Board of Directors regularly reviews reports on 
various aspects of our business, including related risks and 
the strategies for addressing them. While the entire Board 
has overall responsibility for risk oversight, the Board has 
delegated responsibility for certain risks to its committees. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
oversees management of risks related to our environmental, 
sustainability, and corporate social responsibility practices, 
including risks related to our operations and our supply chain. 
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee 
oversees management of risks related to succession 
planning, compensation for our executive officers, and our 
overall compensation program, including our equity-based 
compensation plans, as well as risks related to other human 
capital management matters, including workplace safety, 
culture, diversity, discrimination, and harassment. 
The Audit Committee oversees management of risks related 
to our financial statements and financial reporting process, 
business continuity, and operational risks, the qualifications, 
independence, and performance of our independent 
auditors, the performance of our internal audit function, 
legal and regulatory matters, and our compliance policies 
and procedures. Board and Committee Engagement in 2021
The Board meets regularly during the year, holds special 
meetings, and acts by unanimous written consent whenever 
circumstances require. During 2021, there were five meetings 
of the Board. In addition, the Board participated in regularly 
scheduled teleconference discussions on various topics, 
generally on a monthly basis. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held 
four formal meetings during 2021 and reviewed matters 
that included:
• The Board’s composition, diversity, and skills in the context 
of identifying and evaluating new director candidates to 
join the Board
• The Board’s recruitment and self-evaluation processes
• Board compensation 
• Board Committee membership and qualifications
• Consideration of Amazon’s policies and initiatives regarding 
the environment and sustainability, corporate social 
responsibility, and corporate governance
• Feedback from shareholder engagementThe Leadership Development and Compensation Committee 
held six formal meetings during 2021 and reviewed matters 
that included:
• Design, amounts, and effectiveness of Amazon’s 
compensation for senior executives
• Management succession planning
• Our benefit and compensation programs 
• Our human resources programs, including review of 
workplace discrimination and harassment reports, worker 
safety and workplace conditions, and diversity, equity, and 
inclusion matters
• Feedback from shareholder engagement
The Audit Committee held seven formal meetings during 
2021 and reviewed matters that included:
• Our risk assessment and compliance functions
• Data privacy and security3
• Public policy expenditures
• Treasury and investment matters

Board Diversity 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
seeks out candidates with a diversity of experience and 
perspectives, including diversity with respect to race, gender, 
geography, and areas of expertise. The Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee includes, and has any 
search firm that it engages include, women, individuals from 
underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, and individuals who 
identify as LGBTQ+ in the pool from which the Committee 
selects director candidates. When considering candidates as 
potential Board members, the Board and the Nominating 
and Corporate Governance Committee evaluate the 
candidates’ ability to contribute to such diversity. The Board 
assesses its effectiveness in this regard as part of its annual 
Board and director evaluation process. Currently, of our nine 
independent director nominees, five are women, two are 
from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, and three have 
served for five years or less. Board Diversity Matrix

We believe that effective corporate governance includes 
year-round engagement with our shareholders and other 
stakeholders. In a typical year, we will engage with dozens 
of shareholders, including our largest shareholders, two to 
three times. This outreach is complementary to the hundreds 
of touchpoints our Investor Relations team has with 
shareholders each year. We find it beneficial to have ongoing 
dialogue with our shareholders throughout the year on a full 
range of investor priorities. Depending on the circumstance, 
our lead director or another independent director may 
engage in these conversations with shareholders as well. 
In 2021, as part of our corporate governance engagement, 
we met with corporate governance representatives at 
shareholders owning over 35% of our stock (not counting 
the approximately 13% voted by our founder and Executive 
Chair) and responded to numerous letters from our investors. 
Our direct engagement with shareholders helps us better 
understand our shareholders’ priorities, perspectives, and 
issues of concern while giving us an opportunity to elaborate 
on our many initiatives and practices and to address the 
extent to which various aspects of these matters are (or 
are not) significant given the scope and nature of our 
operations and our existing practices. We take insights 
from this feedback into consideration and regularly share 
them with our Board as we review and evolve our practices 
and disclosures.

Business  
Ethics
Amazon encourages and enforces 
strict adherence to local, state, 
federal, and international laws. 
Our Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics  (Code of Conduct) 
outlines the behavior we expect 
from employees regarding 
potential ethical issues such as 
conflicts of interest, insider trading, 
discrimination and harassment, 
and compliance.Bribery and Corruption
Amazon has zero tolerance for bribery and corruption in 
any form for any of our businesses. Our anti-corruption 
compliance program is implemented as part of a centralized 
global compliance program, led by the Vice President for 
Business Conduct and Ethics. The program is grounded in our 
Code of Conduct, which is supported by numerous additional 
policies, procedures, and other communications, and includes 
an outright prohibition on bribery of any kind. 
Our Business Conduct and Ethics program includes a risk 
assessment and compliance goal-setting process that 
gathers broader business input through regular client 
interviews, a whistleblower hotline, centralized investigation 
and reporting of violations, due diligence processes designed 
to detect potential compliance issues before engaging in 
transactions with third parties, and a wide variety of online 
and in-person training about compliance-related topics and 
the company’s compliance policies. 
Amazon has extensive controls relating to financial 
transactions, through which groups such as accounting, 
finance operations services, accounts payable, and payroll 
all own processes that identify, monitor, and evaluate risks 
including fraud, misappropriation of assets, corruption, and 
the integrity of financial reporting. Other control functions 
such as finance, procurement, and internal audit all work 
together with the Business Conduct and Ethics team to 
prevent, detect, and deter corruption.Data Privacy
Amazon understands that customers care how their personal 
data is collected, used, and shared, and we work every day to 
earn and maintain customer trust. Across all of our products 
and services, our principled approach to privacy  begins 
with transparency, customer control, and security. 
We inform our customers of our privacy and data security 
policies, practices, and technologies through our privacy 
notices, including the Amazon.com Privacy Notice  and the 
AWS Privacy Notice . We are also enhancing cybersecurity 
awareness beyond Amazon by offering the training we use  
for our own employees free to individuals and businesses.
Data Privacy Oversight
An ad hoc committee of the Board appointed in 2022 
receives reports from management and reports to the 
Board at least annually on data protection and cybersecurity 
matters. This committee also reviews the measures 
implemented by Amazon to identify and mitigate data 
protection and cybersecurity risks. Amazon requires 
employees with access to information systems, including 
all corporate employees, to undertake data protection and 
cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually.Whistleblowing 
Amazon provides secure and accessible channels where 
employees can raise concerns and report violations in 
confidence and without risk of reprisal.
As described in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, 
employees can speak with anyone in their management 
chain or the Legal Department when they have a question 
about the application of the Code of Conduct or when in 
doubt about how to properly act in a particular situation. 
The Legal Department has provided guidelines for how 
employees can report concerns. We do not allow retaliation 
against an employee for reporting misconduct by others 
in good faith. Employees must cooperate in internal 
investigations of potential or alleged misconduct, and 
those who violate the Code of Conduct will be subject to 
disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
In addition, suggestions or complaints emailed to a member 
of the senior leadership team are considered Executive 
Escalations. Any employee can utilize this method of 
providing a suggestion or raising a concern to leadership. 
All escalations are independently reviewed by Human 
Resources, used as a learning opportunity, and may be used 
to update our processes to prevent gaps in the future.

Advocacy and 
Public Policy
We operate in regions all over the 
world, and remain committed to 
giving customers everywhere the 
same standard of excellence.Our Approach 
We engage with authorities at the local, state, national, 
and international levels to oversee the seamless operations 
of our international business through different legislative 
demands and compliance requirements. Our Public Policy 
teams work with a wide range of policymakers, multilateral 
organizations, industry associations, coalitions, and other 
partners across numerous regulatory and policy issues. Like 
our business interests, our policy issues are broad, forward 
thinking, and driven by what is best for our customers.
We have publicly stated our position on several key issues. 
These include, but are not limited to:
• Our belief that the minimum federal wage should be raised
• Our statement that bold action is needed to combat human-
induced climate change
• Our recognition of the fundamental importance of diversity, 
equity, and inclusion
• Our support for the Black, LGBTQ+, and 
indigenous communities
• Our commitment to access to affordable housing
• Our belief in the protection of data privacy
• Our support for common sense immigration reform
• Our commitment to help promote democracy and respect 
for human rightsSupporting Our Principles
We believe that the public and private sectors must act 
together to address the world’s most pressing challenges. 
We advocate on various topics that are material to 
our business, including climate action, community 
empowerment, immigration reform, and more. We seek out 
opportunities to partner with the public sector to advance 
new technologies, invest in needed solutions, and support 
public policies that provide certainty and advance innovation.
In 2021, we supported the U.S. federal government’s 
actions to address climate change. This included supporting 
emissions-reducing investments in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law and the climate provisions in the proposed 
Build Back Better legislation. We advocated for alternative 
fuel vehicles, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, 
sustainable aviation fuels, renewable electricity data, federal 
fleet electrification, wind and solar energy, and low-carbon 
research and development. We also joined the We Mean 
Business Coalition in calling for the U.S. to set as soon 
as possible an ambitious and attainable goal to reduce 
emissions by 2030. We also publicly supported the low-
carbon fuels standard proposed by the state of Washington.
In addition, we continued to advocate for higher federal and 
state minimum wages  and renewed our commitment to 
immigrant rights and immigration reform . We collaborated 
with the public sector on housing equity  and called for 
greater support and funding for computer science education in 
public schools , especially in underrepresented communities. We publish an annual political engagement report  on 
our Investor Relations website. The statement details our 
lobbying activities in the U.S. and discloses our specific 
spending on ballot initiatives and public organizations, as 
well as with representatives at state and local levels.

Discussion of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of 
product deliveryCG-EC-410a.2 Shipment Zero is our goal to deliver 50% of Amazon shipments with net-zero carbon by 2030 through sustainable process improvements, recycled materials, investments in vehicle 
electrification, renewable energy initiatives, and more. In 2021, more than 100 million packages were delivered to our customers’ doorsteps across Europe with a fleet of over 3,000 
electric delivery vans and other zero-emission vehicles. Also in 2021, more than half a million packages were delivered to our customers’ doorsteps in North America with electric 
vehicles (EVs). Approximately 8% of Amazon shipments were delivered to customers in North America and Europe without additional packaging in 2021.
To decarbonize our transportation network, we are deploying zero-emission vehicles, using low-carbon fuels, investing in emerging technologies, and collaborating to accelerate 
cross-sector innovation. In 2019, we ordered 100,000 custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian and thousands more from manufacturers such as Stellantis and Mahindra  
Electric. We started deploying battery EV trucks across our heavy commercial trucking fleets and began switching to vehicles that use alternative fuel sources, like compressed 
natural gas trucks. Micromobility technologies, such as cargo bikes and walkers, are used to deliver packages in urban settings. Read more about how we are decarbonizing our 
transportation  on pages 24–25.
To reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging options, we use a science-based approach that combines lab testing, machine learning, materials science, and manufacturing 
partnerships to scale sustainable change across the packaging supply chain. Frustration-Free Packaging is our flagship program to offer more-sustainable packaging that is easy to

Our Approach 
We aim to consistently deliver progress on our climate-
related performance, whether in our own operations or by 
enabling meaningful change beyond our business. We take a 
science-based, customer-centric approach to climate, using a 
structured lifecycle assessment (LCA) model to measure and 
map environmental hotspots across our value chain. 
Our approach to quantifying our carbon footprint reflects 
the complexity of our business. Our team of researchers 
and scientists has combined cutting-edge LCA science and 
AWS technology to develop a robust software solution 
that processes billions of operational and financial records 
from Amazon’s operations across the world to calculate our 
carbon footprint. The software estimates carbon emissions 
for all activities within our system boundary using a dollar-
based environmental assessment model, then enhances the 
accuracy of carbon-intensive activities with detailed, process-
based LCA models. 
We categorize climate risks and opportunities by considering 
customer and stakeholder expectations, regulations, 
business risks, industry best practices, and emerging trends. 
We embed a variety of mechanisms across our business 
operations to address sustainability issues, including climate-
related risks, and we integrate sustainability practices into 
our everyday operations through goal-setting, metrics, and 
leadership reviews.Governance
We have an established governance framework to help 
ensure that risks associated with climate change are 
considered at the most senior levels of our business.
• Board Oversight: The Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee of Amazon’s Board of Directors 
oversees environmental, sustainability, and corporate social 
responsibility practices, and our corporate governance 
policies and initiatives. The committee also oversees our 
progress on The Climate Pledge and risks related to our 
operations, supply chain, and customer engagement.
• Management Oversight: Amazon’s Worldwide 
Sustainability team, along with dedicated teams across 
the company, are working to make operational changes 
that reduce or eliminate carbon in our business. Our 
companywide carbon accounting model provides specific 
operational metrics to business teams on their emissions 
and allows them to track progress on decarbonization. 
We also hold quarterly business reviews with Amazon 
leadership teams to track our progress.Climate-related Risks 
and Opportunities
We are committed to minimizing our carbon emissions 
by optimizing our transportation network and investing 
in electric vehicles; improving product packaging to drive 
efficiency in the distribution of products; implementing 
energy efficiency measures in our operations; using 
renewable energy to run our business; and supporting 
global reforestation. We have joined numerous industry 
partnerships including Ceres, American Council on 
Renewable Energy, Advanced Energy Buyers Group, Carbon 
Leadership Forum, We Mean Business Coalition, First Movers 
Coalition, and Clean Energy Buyers Alliance to express 
support for action on climate change and to accelerate 
the transition to a low-carbon economy.Metrics and Targets
We have a comprehensive understanding of the carbon 
emissions across our business and have done extensive 
analysis to develop science-based targets, strategies, and 
metrics to reduce them. Learn more about the science 
and technology behind our carbon footprint in our 
Carbon Methodology .
Our carbon footprint , including Scope 1, Scope 2, and 
Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, is available on page 97.
Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge—a commitment 
to be net-zero carbon across our business by 2040. We have 
a goal to deliver 50% of Amazon shipments with net-zero 
carbon by 2030. We are also on a path to powering our 
operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five 
years ahead of our original target of 2030. See our public 
methodology  for more on our approach. 
As part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, we are 
proud to have joined the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi) and are working toward setting science-based targets. 
This reaffirms our commitment to reduce carbon emissions 
in line with our ongoing science-based approach to tackle 
climate change.

Climate-related Risks:
We have identified the following climate-related risks based on TCFD risk types and classifications. Physical risks are classified as either: 1) Acute (extreme weather events) or 2) Chronic (changing weather 
patterns and rising mean temperature and sea levels). Transition risks are classified as one or more of the following: 1) Policy and Legal; 2) Technology; 3) Market; and 4) Reputation.
Risk Type Description Classification
Physical Increasing risk of flood or damages due to climate-related events could increase our physical and operational risks and the cost to insure our buildings. Repeated damage due to 
flooding could result in an inability to insure existing buildings.Acute
Weather-related events such as hurricanes could cause asset damage to our buildings, prevent deliveries to customers, and negatively impact sales. Acute
Extreme and prolonged weather events such as droughts could impact water availability for data center operations. Acute
Weather-related events could impact our ability to access raw materials and deliver final products. Acute
A warming climate could increase thermal stress and outdoor associate exposure to criteria air pollutants. These stresses could negatively impact the health of our employees, 
close sites, and delay customer deliveries.Chronic
As temperatures increase and water availability decreases, we could experience rising costs for data center cooling. Chronic

Renewable Energy
Amazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of our original target of 2030. See our public methodology  for more on our approach.. With 274 renewable energy projects 
announced as of the end of 2021, Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy. In 2021, we reached 85% renewable energy across our business, with more than 12 gigawatts of renewable energy production capacity 
across our global portfolio. Once these projects are fully operational, they are expected to deliver up to 33,700 gigawatt-hours of energy annually—the electricity output equivalent to powering more than 3 million U.S. homes for one year.
In 2021, we expanded our renewable energy footprint into new geographies, and by the end of the year, announced renewable energy projects across 18 countries. Our first solar projects in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates came 
online and we announced new projects in locations including Singapore, Japan, Australia, and China. Our projects in South Africa and Japan are the first corporate-backed, utility-scale solar farms in these countries.

Transportation
Decarbonizing our transportation network is a key part of meeting The Climate Pledge by 2040 and making 50% of shipments net-zero carbon by 2030, which is why we are actively transforming our fleet network and operations. We are 
deploying zero-emission vehicles, using low-carbon fuels, investing in emerging technologies, and collaborating with others to accelerate cross-sector innovation. 
In 2019, we ordered 100,000 custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian and thousands more from global manufacturers such as Stellantis and Mahindra Electric. In 2021, more than 100 million packages were delivered to customers’ 
doorsteps across Europe with a fleet of over 3,000 electric delivery vans and other zero-emission vehicles. Also in 2021, more than half a million packages were delivered to customers’ doorsteps in North America with electric vehicles (EVs).
We also started deploying battery EV trucks across our heavy commercial trucking fleets and began switching to vehicles that use alternative fuel sources, like compressed natural gas trucks. Micromobility technologies, such as cargo bikes 
and walkers, are used to deliver packages in urban settings. In 2021, we helped launch Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels and became a founding private sector member of the First Movers Coalition to lead decarbonization of the 
maritime shipping industry.

Waste and Recycling
Amazon is working to send less material to landfills and more back into the circular economy loop by developing waste-prevention and -reuse programs within our own operations and for our customers. Through Amazon Second Chance, 
we offer customers access to a range of services to recycle, repair, or trade in their items, as well as shop for like-new and refurbished products. At our global fulfillment centers, we use software to identify and sort eligible items that are fit 
for donation. We partner with local community organizations to collect these items from Amazon facilities and distribute them to people in need. Since 2019, Amazon has contributed more than 100 million products to our global charity 
partners in North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.
We work with third-party recycling haulers to remove excess corrugated board from our facilities for off-site recycling. Many of these haulers also supply Amazon with the packaging materials that we use for customer shipments, 
converting waste material recovered from Amazon operations into new, recycled packaging. For plastic film, which is not commonly accepted through municipal recycling programs, we have developed on-site recycling systems that enable 
us to convert plastic film into bags made of 100% recycled material.
We incorporate recycled plastics, fabrics, and metals into many new Amazon devices, giving new life to materials that could have otherwise ended up in waste streams. In 2021, we launched several Echo, Fire TV, Fire Tablet, Kindle, and 
Smart Home devices and accessories that include up to 60% recycled molded plastic, up to 100% recycled fabrics, up to 100% recycled aluminum, and up to 70% recycled magnesium, depending on the product.

Product Sustainability 
As part of our mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, we are giving customers access to products that are more sustainable. This includes both our Amazon-branded products and the third-party items we offer that feature 
sustainability certifications through our Climate Pledge Friendly program. Since we launched Climate Pledge Friendly in 2020, the number of products included in the program has grown from 75,000 to more than 250,000. In 2021, more 
than 370 million Climate Pledge Friendly units were shipped to Amazon customers, and we welcomed 20 new third-party sustainability certifications to the program. In early 2022, we launched Amazon Aware, a new line of everyday 
essential items, all with third-party certifications featured in our Climate Pledge Friendly program. 
In addition to offering more-sustainable choices, we want our Amazon Private Brands to support responsible supply chains and contribute to growing circular economies. We are working to enhance the certification and traceability of key 
raw materials and ingredients in our consumable products. We participate in industry partnerships and working groups that drive greater adoption of sustainable and responsible practices. Additionally, we are increasing the amount of

Our holistic approach to water stewardship minimizes both energy and water consumption in our data center operations and guides our water use strategy for each AWS Region. This starts with evaluating climate patterns, local water 
management and availability, and opportunities to avoid using potable water sources whenever possible. We are committed to conserving and reusing water, both in our on-site operations and by working with private and public entities to 
support water availability in communities where we operate data centers.

Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)
ASDI helps researchers, scientists, and innovators around the world advance their work on sustainability-related research. The program provides publicly available, free access to important scientific data that can otherwise be hard for 
researchers to access or analyze. ASDI works with scientific organizations like the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA, the UK Met Office, and the Queensland government to identify, host, and deploy key datasets 
on the AWS Cloud, including weather observations, weather forecasts, climate projection data, satellite imagery, hydrological data, air quality data, and ocean forecast data.
