2018 — Trevo  Retriever receives  expanded indication  for stroke treatment  up to 24 hours in U.S. Boris, who is 71, suddenly stopped  talking during the drive.
When  Benjamin realized something was  wrong with his grandfather, he  grabbed the steering wheel to  avoid crashing and guided the   car to the side of the highway   to call 911.
“I started to scream and scream,  and he didn’t respond at all,”  Benjamin recalls.
“I was scared,   so I called my mom and she told  me to call 911.
I pressed all the  buttons, and I’m not sure what  stopped the car.” “I lost everything.
I couldn’t hear  anything, and I could only see  from the left side,” says Boris.
An ambulance arrived to take  him to UMass Memorial Medical  Center in Worcester, MA, where  he was seen by Dr. Ajit Puri, an  experienced neurointervention  specialist who uses minimally  invasive techniques to treat  stroke, brain aneurysms and  carotid stenosis.
“Boris had a massive stroke where  the main artery of the brain,  called the middle cerebral artery,  was blocked by a big clot,” says Dr. Puri.
“We call that a large  vessel occlusion.
He could not  move the entire right side of his  body.
He could not speak at all,  and he was having a severe gaze  preference,” which indicates eye  movement limitation.
Boris’s best chance for recovery  with a large vessel occlusion was  to have the clot removed using  a stent retriever, a minimally  invasive procedure that is now  the standard of care for large  vessel blockages.
Dr. Puri guided  Stryker’s Trevo Retriever  from  Boris’s femoral artery in his leg up  to the brain, where the retriever  ensnared the clot.
Dr. Puri was  then able to remove the retriever  with the clot back through  a catheter.
With Dr. Puri’s extensive  experience using the stent  retriever, the procedure, from   the time the catheter was inserted,  only took 21 minutes to restore  blood flow to the brain.
As a result,  Boris was soon able to move the  right side of his body and his  speech is now back to normal.“I feel lucky, because if it weren’t  for Ben, if I was alone in the  car — I’m pretty sure I was going  65 miles an hour — I would crash  somewhere,” says Boris.Trevo Retriever   and Benjamin Seventh-grader Benjamin Bubis was going to soccer  practice, as usual.
When he got in the car with his  grandfather, Boris Hutorin, little did he know he  would become a lifesaving hero 40 minutes later.
Saving a life … and a way of living.

Dr. Puri saved my  way of living.” Trevo Retriever: around the globe Training and education Boris’s story   In the news  Suzhou Training Center China Every second counts Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in   the U.S. “Getting emergency help as soon as you  recognize the signs of stroke for you or a loved  one is critical,” says Dr. Puri.
In fact, patients  can lose nearly two million brain neurons  every minute until the clot is removed.
Boris was able to avoid long-term brain  damage, thanks to Benjamin’s actions and  the quick response at the hospital, including  the use of advanced treatments like the  Trevo Retriever.
Until recently, the use of a stent retriever to  remove a clot was limited to the first six hours  after an ischemic stroke, which meant patients  seeking help outside of this time window faced  severe disability and even death.
In early 2018  Stryker’s Trevo Retriever became the first  and only thrombectomy device to receive FDA  clearance to significantly reduce disability   in patients up to 24 hours from   symptom onset.

Stryker | 2018 Annual Review  1Stryker | 2018 Annual Review  1We surpassed $13 billion in sales for the first time,  recorded our 39th consecutive year of sales growth,  posted strong adjusted earnings, completed numerous  acquisitions and garnered accolades as a great place  to work.
Culture and leadership Our mission — Together with our customers, we are  driven to make healthcare better — is a unifying  force in the company, as are our values: Integrity,  Accountability, People and  Performance .
Our people  are driven, team-oriented and humble.
We continue  to be seen as a great place to work (see page 12) and  are honored to have received many international and  diversity and inclusion recognitions.
Our leadership team (see page 16) has changed   following the retirement of Lonny Carpenter and   David Floyd, who both made significant contributions   to our success.
Tim Scannell was appointed President  and Chief Operating Officer, and I look forward to   his leadership in driving performance across our   businesses and regions.
We named two new   commercial Group Presidents — Andy Pierce  (MedSurg) and Spencer Stiles (Neurotechnology,  Instruments and Spine) — and, like Tim, both are  longtime Stryker employees who have demonstrated  excellent performance.
Viju Menon also joined the  company as Group President of Global Quality and  Operations after a successful career in the technology  industry.
Howard Cox retired from our Board and was  named Director Emeritus, while two new directors   were added: Sheri McCoy and Rajeev Suri.
Financial performance  Our organic sales growth of 7.9 percent (which excludes  the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange  and the adoption of Accounting Standards update   ASC 606) was once again at the high end of the medical  technology industry and marked our sixth consecutive  year of accelerating organic growth.
Our sales growth  was well balanced across geographies, with strong  performances in the United States, South Pacific, Japan,  Europe, Latin America and emerging markets.
In fact,  our organic sales growth outside the United States was  higher than our United States growth.
Reported sales  growth was 9.3 percent, including 1.9 percent growth Our momentum continues  as we delivered another  successful year in 2018!Dear   shareholders, Kevin A.
Lobo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 2from acquisitions and increased unit volume partially  offset by a 1.4 percent impact from lower prices.
We also continued to generate healthy operational   cash flow that contributed to a year-end cash and  marketable securities position of $3.7 billion, enabling  us to increase our dividend rate by 10.6 percent for   the January 2019 payment.
Our reported net earnings   grew 248.3 percent, aided by the favorability of   onetime tax events, and our adjusted net earnings   grew by 12.7 percent.
Innovation In 2018, our strong innovation pipeline helped   power our growth, as we spent 6.3 percent of sales   on research and development and launched many   exciting products, such as the Neuroform Atlas   Stent System in Neurovascular and the Trident II   Acetabular System in Joint Replacement.
We continued to add innovations to our product and  service portfolios through acquisitions (see pages 4–5),  including the high-growth spinal implant company  K2M.
Our Instruments business added Entellus, which  expands our Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) offering,  along with Invuity, which offers lighted retractors  and advanced energy products.
We also acquired  HyperBranch, a dural sealant product that strengthens  our Craniomaxillofacial (CMF) portfolio, and Hygia,   to deepen our Sustainability Solutions business.Cost transformation  Our multi-year effort to systematically reduce costs  continues to progress.
We were pleased to deliver 40  basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion  in 2018 (excluding the impact of ASC 606), despite  significant dilution from acquisitions.
And we continue  to make progress establishing shared services in Human  Resources and Finance and implementing a single ERP   system to support our commercial businesses and  optimize our manufacturing and supply chain.
Looking ahead, we expect Stryker to continue to grow  sales at the high end of the medical technology industry,  while driving leveraged earnings.
Our strategy, people  and culture will enable us to maintain our strong  performance in the years ahead.
I would like to thank our management teams, our Board  of Directors, and our 36,000 employees worldwide who  live our mission and values every day.

Stryker | 2018 Annual Review  7People and culture Driven to innovate Customers and patients are at the heart of everything we do.
We nurture innovation to address customer challenges.
That approach began with our  founder, Dr. Homer Stryker, an  orthopaedic surgeon in Kalamazoo,  Michigan, who invented products in  the local community hospital where  he worked to better serve the needs   of his patients.
This spirit of innovation continues to  drive us today.
We collaborate with  hospitals and healthcare providers  to make sure we understand their  practice environment, treatment  protocols and unmet needs.
Our deep understanding of our  customers helps us design and  manufacture products and services  that make a difference for them.
We collaborate across the company  and leverage our talented innovators  to develop meaningful technology   and solutions.
And we recognize  our best.
Our R&D Fellows Award recognizes  significant accomplishments in  research and development over time, reflecting the importance of  innovation and collaboration to help  solve customer problems and develop  products and services that advance  our mission.
Nominated by their R&D leader and  division president, Fellows have  developed breakthrough technology  and market-leading products that  have influenced the direction of  our business.
Early in his career, John played a key role in  developing and introducing many new knee, hip  and bone cement products before leading teams  in the development of our additive manufacturing  technology.
His work included technical and process  design as well as the creation of a software and  equipment supplier base for producing high-quality,  innovative additive products.
John’s leadership  resulted in the launch of our first additive implant,  the Triathlon Tritanium Tibial Baseplate, in   June 2013, and many others that followed.Robert’s many contributions to the advancement  of hip and knee products over the years are evident  in the 28 patents for which he is responsible,  including the tibial component delta fit keel design,  which is integral to tibial component stability and  initial fixation.
Robert was also instrumental in  transitioning Mako robotics from being a niche   player in partial knee replacement to establishing   a broad-based arthroplasty platform, while guiding   the development process and regulatory strategy   for Mako Total Knee.

That’s why our Stryker’s  Women’s Network (SWN) partnered  with I WISH (Inspiring Women in  STEM), an initiative to inspire and  motivate young female students to  pursue careers in STEM.
I WISH  encourages female role models to  share their experiences, from school  subject choices and college and  career choices to day-to-day work  as engineers.
The statistics tell the story:  58 percent of students earning a  degree in the United States are  women, but only 39 percent of  students earning STEM degrees  are women.
I WISH hosted a conference and  interactive exhibitions in Cork and  Dublin, Ireland, where a Stryker  team met with 6,000 women to show  them how we are driven to make  healthcare better.
Our team members also spoke to  the teachers in attendance about  our graduate programs and the  opportunities that are available to students, including the Quality  Graduate Rotational Program, the  RISE Engineering Program, the  Global Engineering Development  Program and various internships.
We also had interactive, hands-on  demonstrations of our products  and technologies that improve and  save lives, including defibrillators,  endoscopes, cranial drills,  biomaterials, stents, catheters,  ultrasonics and robots, among others.
Employee resource  groups (ERGs)  SWN enhances opportunities for  members through networking,  professional development, leadership  messages, community outreach and  educational projects that drive the  attraction, development, engagement  and retention of talented women.
The network is open to all employees,  both men and women, and includes  thousands of members across  the globe.
Other Stryker ERGs include  Stryker’s Allies for Equality (SAFE),  Women in Stryker’s Engineering  (WISE), Stryker’s African American  Network (SAAN), SOMOS (Hispanic/ Latino), Stryker’s Emerging  Professionals (SEP) and Stryker’s  Veterans Association (SVA).58% of the students  earning a  degree in the  United States  are women 39% of STEM  graduates  are womenWe encourage, value and leverage the differences in people and  perspectives to make healthcare better.
