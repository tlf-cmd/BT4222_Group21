Running a responsible and sustainable business 
is foundational for The Home Depot. It reflects the 
core values upon which our company was built and 
the entrepreneurial spirit that allows us to thrive in 
a changing marketplace. It also reflects our view 
of what success will look like for our company, our 
communities and our planet in the years to come. 
We organize our approach around three key pillars:
This Responsibility Report details the daily work 
we do to support these three pillars, as well as the 
progress we made in 2018 thanks to the dedication 
and ingenuity of our associates and suppliers. 
You’ll discover high- and low-tech innovations. 
For example, materials engineering allowed us 
to eliminate enough PVC film from our private-
brand packaging to cover 28 football fields, while 
a simple-but-smart training change led to a 7% 
reduction in injuries among our new hires.
You’ll learn more about how we strive to create a 
work environment that’s inclusive, engaging and 
rewarding to associates. Our workforce of over 
400,000 people is more ethnically diverse than the 
U.S. working population. Our associates reflect the 
customers and communities we serve. Four out of 
five associates feel emotionally committed to our 
company. Their outstanding performance in 2018 
enabled 100% of our stores to qualify for Success 
Sharing bonus payments to non-management 
associates. We offer training and development 
that transforms jobs into careers; 90% of our store 
leaders began as hourly associates.Our partnerships with suppliers allow us to give 
our customers access to hundreds of products 
that are good for their homes and good for the 
environment. In 2018, our energy-saving products 
enabled customers to cut their energy consumption 
by 10 billion kilowatt hours, equivalent to eliminating 
emissions from more than 2 million cars. Our water-
saving products allowed customers to reduce 
consumption by 59 billion gallons.
In our operations, we continued efforts to use less 
energy. From 2010 to 2018, energy consumption 
at our U.S. stores dropped 26%, even as our store 
count grew over that time. 
We are strengthening our communities by giving 
back financially and through associates’ Team 
Depot volunteering — a hallmark of who we are. In 
2018, the Home Depot Foundation increased our 
long-standing commitment to veterans by pledging 
an additional $250 million, meaning we will give 
half a billion dollars to support veteran causes by 
2025. Associates contributed their time and energy 
to these causes, too. During our Celebration of 
Service in the seven weeks leading up to Veterans 
Day 2018, our people volunteered 100,000 hours to 
support veterans. 
But we can always do more. On Page 11 you’ll see 
the goals we’ve set for doing our part to build a 
better business and world.
The creativity and commitment of our associates 
and suppliers make The Home Depot successful. 
Thank you for your interest in our progress and our 
plans for improvement.

ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS  
& SETTING PRIORITIES
A variety of stakeholders are interested in how we 
run our business. Customers ask us questions 
when they walk into our stores or shop with us 
online. Citizens contact us with concerns. We 
meet with shareholders and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs). We take part in industry 
efforts to raise awareness about the social and 
environmental responsibilities we all share.
These interactions may be informal or formal, as 
detailed in our Materiality Assessment Framework 
on the following pages. Together with our regular 
materiality assessment, they help us gauge the 
impact of our business, set priorities, measure 
our progress and design ways to improve.
Our Sustainability Council, composed of 
representatives from different areas of the 
business, oversees our approach to sustainability. 
The Council focuses on seven key areas, as 
shown on the right.
The Council meets twice a year, and its chairman 
presents our sustainability strategy and activities 
to the Board of Directors annually. Our priorities 
and plans are communicated through our 
company structure from leaders to associates.
This understanding of our impact and 
collaboration with our stakeholders enables us 
to set objectives that improve the sustainability 
of our operations and maximize our influence 
in developing sustainable products for our 
customers.

FAQ: MEASURING OUR 
PROGRESS
Vice President of Environmental Innovation Ron Jarvis has spent nearly two decades working with 
stakeholders to drive sustainability progress at The Home Depot. Some of the frequently asked questions 
he responds to give insight into our efforts to improve and regularly measure progress.
People around the globe increasingly 
focus on the connection between carbon 
emissions and climate change. How 
does The Home Depot monitor its carbon 
emissions? Q.
We have been tracking our carbon emissions 
since 2009 using metrics that are industry 
standards:
• Scope 1: Direct emissions from 
combustible sources and refrigerants
• Scope 2: Indirect emissions from 
purchasing electricity
• Scope 3: Emissions from upstream 
transportation and distribution of freight
Through our efforts and focus we have 
reduced our absolute carbon emissions by 
over 3 million metric tonnes since 2009. This 
was achieved amid significant growth — from 
$66 billion in sales in 2008 to $108 billion in 
2018. Learn more on Page 44.A.
Does The Home Depot have consistent 
global workplace standards for suppliers 
— regardless of where their factories are 
located? Q.
We formalized our supplier standards in 2002. 
These standards apply to all suppliers in all 
countries and cover 14 categories, including 
worker safety, hours and wages, underage 
labor and more. In 2018, we performed a 
combined 3,011 factory audits and follow-up 
visits to supplier sites. Read more on Page 50.A.What is The Home Depot’s Wood 
Purchasing Policy, and how have you 
adapted it as the world’s forests have 
changed? Q.
We established our Wood Purchasing 
Policy in 1999 to help guide our suppliers 
in sourcing sustainable wood. We work with 
many stakeholders to understand ongoing 
global forestry issues and update our 
policy accordingly. In 2018, we increased 
protections for forests in Papau New Guinea, 
the Solomon Islands, the South American 
Amazon Basin and the African Congo Basin. 
Learn more on Page 54.A.Do you track the impact of water- and 
energy-saving products sold at The Home 
Depot? Q.
Our biggest environmental impact comes from 
the products we sell. We track and report on 
the results that come from our customers 
choosing more eco-friendly products. We are 
ahead of our stated goals to help customers 
cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 million 
metric tonnes and reduce water use by 250 
billion gallons by 2020 through the purchase 
and proper use of our consumption-reducing 
products. Find out more on Page 64 and 
Page 66.A.17
2019 Responsibility Report
How does The Home Depot select which 
product categories to focus on to address 
environmental concerns? Q.
Every year we review our major product 
categories to identify largest volumes. 
We then assess stakeholder feedback 
and concerns and prioritize potential 
environmental improvements that could 
have the greatest impact. In addition, we 
continually assess and address stakeholder 
concerns, even for small-volume product 
categories, to guide improvements 
throughout the year. Read more about how 
we work with stakeholders on Page 6.A.
What does The Home Depot’s Eco Options 
product classification mean?Q.
Our Eco Options® program identifies 
products that have less of an impact on 
the environment than comparable standard 
products. It’s our effort to better define and 
clarify manufacturers’ green claims. Just 
knowing the potential impact of certain 
products or how we use them can help all of 
us make better choices about how we use 
energy, water and chemicals in our homes. 
Thousands of people go through our doors 
every day, which puts us in a unique position 
to educate customers about products that are 
good for their homes and the environment. 
Discover more about Eco Options and our 
Chemical Strategy on Page 58.A.- Ron Jarvis, Vice President of Environmental InnovationJust knowing the potential impact of certain products and 
how we use them can help all of us make better choices.”18

DIVERSITY & INCLUSION
A diverse and inclusive workplace is about much 
more than measuring data. At The Home Depot, 
it is an integral part of our culture. It’s the right 
thing to do, and it’s also good for our business. 
People from different backgrounds bring different 
perspectives and ideas to our company, and that 
cultivates innovation.
We actively integrate diversity and inclusion into 
every aspect of our business. Our associates 
and our suppliers, our product selection and 
the services we offer — all reflect our aim to 
create a workplace and company that reflects 
the communities we serve. Associate feedback 
helps us gauge progress. Through our Voice 
of the Associate Survey, we ask for and act on 
associates’ assessments of our workplace.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion was 
established almost 40 years ago in our eight 
core values. We remain committed to those 
values and to fostering an environment where our 
associates, customers and suppliers are valued 
and respected.  
The Home Depot Values Wheel
DID YOU KNOW?+
In 2018, over 40% of promotions were earned by 
minority associates, and over 45% were earned by 
female associates.Hiring  
Our inclusive practices make The Home Depot a 
great place to work and shop. We are intentional 
in our efforts to build a workforce that reflects the 
communities in which we do business, even as 
demographics shift. 
We also lead by example through diversity on our 
Board of Directors and executive team. Here are 
some of the ways we foster an inclusive workplace:
• The Home Depot career website offers 
candidates a view of the company’s 
commitment to diversity and inclusion.
• We post openings on diversity-focused job 
boards to increase diversity among applicants.
• We regularly participate in diversity-related 
career fairs around the nation.
• We use social media, traditional advertising in 
multicultural markets and other outreach

ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT
Engaged associates care about their work and 
the performance of The Home Depot. They work 
with enthusiasm and understand that their efforts 
make a difference. Associate engagement is the 
emotional commitment our associates have to our 
company and our goals. Engagement is vital to  
The Home Depot’s culture and to our success.
Voice of the Associate Survey  
We create an engaging workplace by asking and 
acting on associate feedback. Our annual Voice 
of the Associate survey helps us determine how 
emotionally connected our associates are to the 
company, their jobs, coworkers and leaders. The 
survey data and associate feedback are used to 
help improve associate experiences. Over 310,000 
associates participated in the most recent survey. 
The results show that, on average, four out of five 
associates feel emotionally committed to The Home 
Depot. Female and minority associates rate our 
company at 80% or better for our commitment to 
diversity and inclusion.Success Sharing & Bonuses  
Our philosophy of taking care of our people and 
motivating them to deliver a superior customer 
experience shapes our profit-sharing program for 
hourly associates. Success Sharing provides semi-
annual cash awards for performance against our 
business plan, including sales and productivity goals. 
The program has granted awards totaling more than 
$1 billion to associates over the last five years.
The outstanding performance of our associates in 
fiscal 2018 enabled 100% of stores to qualify for 
Success Sharing in both the first and second half 
of the year. This resulted in bonus payments to our 
non-management associates of approximately  
$222 million.
In 2018, we also paid a one-time bonus of up to 
$1,000 to our U.S. hourly associates related to the 
expected benefit from U.S. tax reform. In addition, 
we established a merit increase budget for our 
associates of between 2.5% and 3%.

PARENTAL LEAVE GIVES  
DADS AND NEWBORNS  
TIME TO BOND
Meet two fathers who took advantage of 
The Home Depot’s updated parental leave 
policy to spend time with their families. 
Bonding with their newborns helped them 
at home and at work.
First-Time Parents Welcome Three  
Matt Sullins and his wife had a big surprise 
when they went in for an ultrasound. 
“We saw there were actually two babies. 
We were in shock for 10 minutes,” Matt 
said. Then came another surprise. “The 
technician’s eyes got big, and we said,‘Is 
that a third baby?’” 
His wife spent the final 10 weeks of the 
pregnancy on bed rest, so Matt, a garden 
associate in Flowery Branch, Georgia, 
started preparing to take paid parental 
leave. “With multiples, you don’t know 
when your babies are going to be born,”  
he explained. 
When Piper, Roman and Blakely were born 
at full-term in July, Matt’s leave began 
immediately. His time at home gave his wife 
an opportunity to rest and recover. It also 
allowed the first-time father get to know his 
children. “I was able to bond with the kids,” 
he said. “There’s nothing like waking up 
and taking them downstairs, knowing that 
you get to spend the entire day with them.”
Matt was initially anxious about returning to 
work, but it was a smooth transition. “When 
I got back, I was able to hit the ground 
running,” he said, “and the team here was 
happy to see me back.”Getting Past the ‘Mental Block’
Shay Thomas became a dad for the third time 
in November when his son, Micah, was born. 
“For my previous two [children], I didn’t have 
more than 14 days away,” said the district 
manager for northern Connecticut.
His wife was thrilled about The Home Depot’s 
updated parental leave policy, but Shay was 
initially hesitant to take advantage of the 
benefit. “I prided myself on being a guy who 
didn’t take time off. I had to get past the 
mental block.”
Shay’s regional vice president, a champion of 
the updated policy, encouraged him to take 
parental leave. Shay was able to help care for 
his wife while she recovered from childbirth, 
take his older kids to school and help transition 
Micah into the family.
Meanwhile, back at work, associates who 
had stepped up to cover his duties gained 
confidence and demonstrated their ability to 
lead. “That will help us over the long term,” 
Shay said.
Associates Matt Sullins and Shay Thomas benefited from THD’s 
updated policy to provide six weeks of paid leave to parents 
welcoming a new child through birth, adoption or foster care.34

2019 Responsibility ReportSPOTLIGHT: EASING THE 
FINANCIAL BURDEN  
OF A MEDICAL EMERGENCY
Soon after joining The Home Depot, Ray Ferry 
learned about The Homer Fund and began 
donating. As a veteran, he saw parallels 
between the company’s core value of taking 
care of our people and ideals he practiced 
during his 20 years in the military as a medic.
“In the Army, it’s all the same,” he said. “It’s 
being part of a huge, huge family. You have a 
brother or a sister to your left or to your right, 
and they look out for you, and you look out for 
them. That’s how it is with The Home Depot.”
Ray’s life changed when he was rushed to 
an emergency room with early stage organ 
failure. Doctors put him in an induced coma 
for a month and a half, during which he 
underwent six abdominal surgeries.
Ray’s store manager applied for a Homer 
Fund grant on his family’s behalf. The financial 
support helped his wife and daughter with 
living expenses while Ray was recovering. 
“It was such a relief to know that somebody 
else cared enough about not only me, but my 
family, also,” he said.
It’s being part of a huge, 
huge family. You have 
a brother or a sister to 
your left or right, and 
they look out for you.”

2019 Responsibility ReportSPOTLIGHT: INNOVATING TO IMPROVE ASSOCIATE SAFETY
Our people are our most important asset, and 
in 2018 we took an entrepreneurial approach to 
improving their safety.
Helping New Associates Stay Injury Free
We increased new associates’ safety with a training 
program designed just for them. New associates 
kept learning after their initial training by participating 
in monthly InFocus training modules. The modules 
detailed best practices for avoiding injuries and kept 
safety top of mind.
Those fundamentals were reinforced by store leaders 
who met with new hires to explain the importance 
of injury prevention and The Home Depot’s 
commitment to their safety.
Over 150,000 associates received this specialized 
new-hire training in 2018. The result: a 7% reduction 
in injuries among new hires, compared to 2017.
Engineering Against Risk
Our Store Support Center and field teams continually 
collaborate to create processes and tools that make the associate experience safer. In 2018, their 
innovation was a small but powerful lift-assist 
tool that lets a single operator load a bulky, heavy 
item into a customer’s vehicle with very little 
ergonomic demand on the body.
The tool, which is akin to a portable loading 
dock, does the lifting for the associate. We co-
developed it in partnership with a supplier and 
rolled it out to about 20 stores in 2018. More 
stores are getting the device in 2019.
Being There for Injured Associates
We put a lot of energy into safety awareness and 
injury prevention, but injuries still occur. Part of 
how we live The Home Depot values is by being 
there for associates.
In 2018, we began a process of fostering formal 
conversations between store leaders and 
injured associates. Our goals: learn from what 
happened, prevent recurrence and reinforce to 
our associates that they are the company’s most 
valuable resource.

DATA SECURITY
The Home Depot values and respects the privacy 
of its customers and visitors. Our Privacy and  
Security Statement  provides information about 
how we collect, use and share information we 
collect from our customers and visitors.
We leverage the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework 
as the foundation of our cybersecurity program. 
As cybersecurity attackers become increasingly 
more sophisticated, our program prioritizes threat 
mitigation, while focusing on maintaining the 
integrity and resiliency of our systems. We invest 
in our ability to identify, protect and detect security 
risks within our environment.
In the event that we identify a security issue, we 
have defined procedures to respond and recover 
as quickly as possible. Overseeing our efforts on 
a day-to-day basis is our Information Technology 
Security team, led by an officer-level chief 
information security officer. Our approach enables 
us to drive a collectively secure culture.

our business and improvements in data collection 
and reporting.
We participate in the CDP® reporting process. 
CDP , formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, 
is an independent, international, nonprofit 
organization that provides a global system for 
companies and cities to measure, disclose, 
manage and share environmental information.
We received a score of A from CDP for our 
latest report, reflecting our high level of action 
on climate change mitigation, adaptation and 
transparency in 2017. CDP also named our 
company an industry leader.
In 2018, we set a science-based target  
goal linked to our annual CDP reporting. We 
committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions 
2.1% per year to achieve a 39.9% reduction 
by 2030 and a 50.4% reduction by 2035. Our 
progress will come from continually improving 
energy efficiency in our operations and expanding 
our investments in renewable and alternative 
energy. In our U.S. stores, we reduced our energy 
use by 98 million kilowatt hours in 2018.

PROTECTING THE CLIMATE
ENERGY USE
We constantly strive to improve the sustainability 
of our operations because it’s good for our 
business and for the planet. Our efforts to 
increase operational efficiency and reduce our 
environmental impact have multiplier effects that 
drive innovation and benefit communities.
When we invest in technologies that supply 
new sources of energy or reduce consumption, 
we increase the viability of those solutions. The 
smart energy choices we make today contribute 
to a greener future.
Prioritizing Conservation  
The simplest way to reduce emissions from 
energy use is to use less energy. In 2018, 
electricity consumption by our U.S. stores was 
26% less than in 2010. That put us ahead of our 
stated 2020 goal to achieve a 20% reduction in 
store kilowatt hour energy use, compared to 2010 
consumption. In 2018 alone, U.S. store energy 
consumption dropped 2.9%.
Our results come from making improvements 
kilowatt by kilowatt. In 2018, we installed energy-
efficient heating, air-conditioning and ventilation 
systems in 133 stores. Over the last seven years, 
we’ve updated HVAC units in 467 stores.
We’ve upped the ante on LED lighting. A few 
years ago, we began retrofitting lighting from 6- 
to 4-lamp LED fixtures — ultimately upgrading 
lights in over 1,300 stores. We learned from 
those improvements, and in 2018, we installed 
even more efficient LED lights above the aisles 
and garden centers of 295 stores. The energy-
saving results so far have been impressive. We’re 
collecting additional data in 2019 as we expand 
LEDs to more stores.We continue to benefit from earlier initiatives to 
install upgraded building automation systems in 
all U.S. and Canadian stores and add variable 
frequency drives (VFDs) to more than 600 
stores. VFDs conserve energy by ensuring 
equipment uses only the electricity needed to 
meet immediate HVAC demands.
Balancing Energy Supply and Demand  
More than 750 stores participate in demand 
mitigation to help balance power supply and 
demand. Here’s how it works: During peak 
demand, utilities or grid operators strategically 
divert electricity from some of our stores, 
reducing the chance of regional outages and 
optimizing the price we pay for electricity.
In addition, we use on-site batteries to store 
electricity during off-peak times for use when 
demand rises. At the end of 2018, batteries 
were in place at 10 stores in California. We’re 
installing more in 2019.
Our U.S. stores reduced energy consumption 
by 98 million kilowatt hours in 2018, even as 
we added a new store to our footprint. LED 
lights contributed significantly to the savings.DID YOU KNOW?+47

• On-site solar: We began 2018 with 13 small-
scale solar farms atop U.S. stores, and we 
ended the year with 45. Rooftop solar takes 
advantage of the soccer field-size space at 
the top of our big boxes. Each solar farm 
reduces the store’s annual electricity grid 
demand by an estimated 35% or more. That’s 
the equivalent of powering 2,300 average 
U.S. homes for a year. Our goal is to have 
sun-fueled power plants on more than 50 U.S. 
stores.
• Fuel cells: Where rooftop infrastructure won’t 
support solar panels, we’re looking at other 
alternative energy options, including fuel 
cells. These mini power plants cut polluting 
emissions significantly — in some cases by 
50% — compared to using traditional power 
sources. By the end of 2018, fuel cells were 
operating outside 202 stores — 26 more 
locations than the year before. The fuel cells 
produce more than 90% of each store’s 
electricity needs. More fuel cell installations 
are underway in 2019.  Leveraging Alternative and Renewable Energy  
We support and tap into sustainable energy that’s 
produced off-site and on-site. All of these sources 
bring us closer to our goal of leveraging 135 
megawatts of alternative and renewable energy 
by 2020. In addition, when The Home Depot buys 
or produces energy from renewable sources, we 
strengthen the business case for such alternatives.
• Off-site wind: In early 2017, we became a 
customer of the Los Mirasoles Wind Farm 
northeast of McAllen, Texas. The energy 
purchased from the farm is enough to power 
90 stores. We also purchase power from the 
Zopiloapan Wind Farm in central Mexico.
• Off-site solar: We partner with solar energy 
providers in Delaware, Massachusetts and 
Minnesota. Our support boosts the viability of 
solar power in these areas.PROTECTING THE CLIMATE

We owe it to our customers, associates and 
communities to further the collective commitment 
to human rights, safety and environmentally sound 
practices through ethical sourcing. We engage our 
suppliers in this commitment by prioritizing the 
purchase of products made in factories that adhere 
to our responsible sourcing standards. We report 
on our progress in an annual Responsible Sourcing 
Report .
Our responsible sourcing standards mandate that 
suppliers and factories abide by all applicable 
international and local laws, rules and regulations in 
the manufacturing and distribution of merchandise 
or services provided to us. We conduct audits 
around the world to ensure compliance with our 
responsible sourcing standards.
Suppliers must keep on-site documentation that 
demonstrates compliance with our responsible 
sourcing standards. They also must allow Home 
Depot associates and/or representatives full access 
to production facilities, worker records, production 
records and workers for confidential interviews in 
connection with monitoring visits. We expect our 
suppliers to promptly correct any non-compliance, 
starting with timely preparation and presentation of 
a corrective and preventative action plan.ETHICAL SOURCING
If suppliers fail to improve, we may terminate 
our business relationships with them. Equally 
important, we support factories that take action to 
create lasting social and environmental compliance 
programs. We encourage suppliers and factory 
workers to communicate concerns via processes 
outlined in our corporate Code of Conduct .
Our responsible sourcing audits are designed to 
assess compliance in these areas: 
 
•     Laws and regulations 
•     Child labor 
•     Forced labor 
•     Harassment and abuse 
•     Compensation

Our company expects all suppliers that 
manufacture our products to provide appropriate 
information and conduct due diligence to enable 
our compliance with conflict minerals laws. 
We also expect these manufacturers to obtain 
products and materials from suppliers that are 
not involved in funding conflict in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining 
covered countries. We partner with our private 
brands and proprietary product suppliers whose 
products contain tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold 
(referred to as 3TG) to identify the source of any 
of these minerals in the supply chain.
2018 Progress  
As detailed in The Home Depot’s Conflict  
Minerals Report  for 2018, our efforts focused 
on collecting and disseminating information 
about sourcing practices of our suppliers. 
We cataloged that information in a database 
using the conflict minerals reporting template 
developed by the Responsible Minerals  
Initiative® (formerly the Conflict-Free Sourcing 
Initiative, or CFSI).
We continued to refine our supplier review 
processes for suppliers by excluding 
any that merely affixed company brands, 
trademarks, logos or labels to generic products 
manufactured by a third party, as permitted 
by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
guidance. As a result, in-scope Tier 1 suppliers 
decreased to 153 in 2018 from 212 in 2017.CONFLICT MINERALS  SOURCING RESPONSIBLY
Through our due diligence process, which 
aligns with guidance from the Organisation for  
Economic Co-Operation and Development , we 
received 100% participation from our in-scope 
private brands and proprietary-product Tier 1 
suppliers.
Thirty-four percent of our Tier 1 suppliers 
indicated that one or more conflict minerals were 
necessary to the functionality or production of 
covered products. Of the smelters or refiners 
reported by these suppliers, only 52 out of a total 
of 312 sourced conflict minerals from covered 
countries. All of these smelters or refiners were 
certified as DRC conflict-free by the Responsible 
Minerals Initiative, the London Bullion Market 
Association and/or the Responsible Jewellery 
Council. However, a small number of suppliers 
below the Tier 1 level were unable to complete 
chain-of-custody surveys back to the level of the 
smelter or refiner.
We continue to work closely with our suppliers 
to ensure they implement responsible sourcing; 
obtain current, accurate and complete information 
about the supply chain; and encourage their 
smelters to obtain a “conflict-free” designation 
from an independent third-party auditor.53

SUPPLY CHAINSOURCING RESPONSIBLY
Our multiyear supply chain synchronization 
initiative, called Project Sync, continues to improve 
the way we store and move products. Project Sync 
incorporates and builds on clean transportation 
best practices throughout our supply chain. 
That omnichannel approach and our focus on 
sustainability earned The Home Depot a spot on 
Gartner Research’s list of the Top 25 corporate 
supply chains in 2018. 
Reducing Emissions Intensity  
In late 2017, we announced our company would 
invest $1.2 billion to update equipment, technology 
and infrastructure across our supply chain to meet 
customers’ evolving demands. In 2018, some 
of those improvements began to take shape. 
They’re helping us reduce our carbon dioxide 
emissions intensity. That means we’re lessening the 
environmental impact of our each mile our goods 
travel, even as our business grows.
Our supply chain leverages green technologies 
like hydrogen fuel cells, which produce off-the-
grid power that doesn’t create polluting emissions. 
More than 170 fuel cells power forklifts at our direct 
fulfillment center in Troy Township, Ohio. At our 
stocking distribution center in Savannah, Georgia, 
over 130 fuel cells do the job. Combined, these 
fuel cells save nearly 4 million kilowatt hours of 
electricity a year.
Reporting Our Results  
We participate in the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency’s SmartWay® program to collect and report 
greenhouse gas emissions data from corporate 
supply chains — and we encourage others to, 
as well. We require all Home Depot carriers to 
be SmartWay partners, and we audit our carriers 
annually to ensure their data is properly submitted 
to the EPA. We are a six-time recipient of the

We know that yards, patios and balconies are 
more than outdoor spaces — they’re ecosystems 
that have an impact on their surroundings. That’s 
why The Home Depot works closely with our 
growers and suppliers to offer healthy trees, 
blooms and edible plants that support local 
environments and pollinators. We’re excited about 
meeting customers’ growing demand for organic 
and environmentally beneficial plants.
Organic Edibles  
We’re making it easier for our customers to grow  
organic. We now offer more than 50 varieties of 
organic, non-GMO vegetable and herb plants 
grown according to methods approved by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National 
Organic Program. Only products that have 
been certified as meeting the USDA’s organic  
production and handling standards  may carry  
the USDA Organic seal.
Native & Healthy Plants  
Native plants contribute to the health of 
ecosystems and pollinators. Our growers 
work closely with U.S. states’ departments of 
agriculture to identify invasive plants that may 
threaten local native plants.
Growing Local  
Each region in which we operate has a unique 
ecosystem with its own weather patterns, soils 
and growing challenges. We are proud to partner 
with 250 local growers who carefully balance the 
impact of their production with local environmental 
issues. These partnerships reduce transportation 
costs and carbon dioxide emissions, and they 
enable us to offer affordable selections of plants 
and trees — while supporting the local economies 
of communities we serve.

SPOTLIGHT: REDUCING SINGLE-USE 
PLASTIC IN THE GARDEN
For more than 10 years, the Home Depot has been 
participating in the Plant Pot Recycling Program, 
which helps our customers reduce and recycle 
plastic used for their gardens. We ask customers to 
bring back the plastic pots that hold plants they buy 
at our garden centers across the U.S. Then we send 
the pots back to growers, who return them to our 
stores with new plants for sale.
When the pots are no longer usable, program partner 
East Jordan Plastics recycles them into new pots, 
trays and hanging baskets. This creates a closed-
loop solution to reducing plastic — also called the 
circular economy. The Home Depot is the largest 
retail contributor to the program, which recycled 
about 15 million pounds of plastic in 2009 and now 
recycles more than 33 million pounds a year.
Recycling plastic containers recovers more than 60% 
of the energy tied to initial production and diverts 
waste from landfills. It streamlines the supply chain, 
too. Shipping racks now have a two-way purpose. 
They travel back to plant nurseries filled with pots 
that the suppliers can reuse.
In 2018, we returned 
enough plant pots for 
recycling to fill more than 
800 15-yard dumpsters 
— keeping all that plastic 
out of landfills.We accept containers with

Our customers’ demand for clean, sustainable 
energy is growing as residential solar energy 
systems become more available and affordable 
than ever before. Our partnerships with Sunrun® 
and Vivant Solar® make it easier for our 
customers to access clean energy by capturing 
the power of the sun at home.
The solar energy systems from both of our 
suppliers are able to send excess power from 
customers’ homes back to the electric grid. 
That enables the whole community to benefit 
from clean power from the sun. Some utilities 
even offer solar credits to customers, essentially 
buying the extra solar power their homes 
produce.

Smaller packages saved nearlyThe Home Depot’s packaging team works with 
our private-label product suppliers to apply 
science to creating better packages. Our goals 
are to reduce package footprints and use more 
sustainable materials.
The innovations we achieve are good for the 
environment and for our business. We cut down 
on waste, boost shipping efficiency and reduce 
damage to products.
Using Less EPS  
In 2018, our packaging team continued a multi-
year effort to find substitutes for expanded 
polystyrene (EPS) foam. EPS foam is good at 
protecting products, but it contains beads of 
chemicals and oil that are often difficult to recycle 
and can take more than 500 years to biodegrade.
We’re replacing EPS with recyclable materials 
like molded pulp and paper in some private-label 
packaging. In 2017, we eliminated 341,000 cubic 
feet of EPS foam from our packaging. In 2018, 
we eliminated more than 517,600 cubic feet 
— enough to keep six Olympic-size swimming 
pools of EPS foam out of landfills.
Reducing PVC  
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film is widely used 
in packaging. The thin, rigid synthetic plastic 
polymer is molded around products to protect 
them from damage. But, like EPS, PVC film 
is difficult to recycle and takes a long time 
to biodegrade. In 2018, our packaging team 
eliminated 1.6 million square feet of PVC film 
from private-brand packaging, enough to cover 
28 football fields.REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

miles from downtown Miami. Pure Beauty also has 
a Georgia farm with about 120 acres. Plants don’t 
travel far to reach Home Depot stores and customers’ 
homes across the Southeast. 
We are fortunate to be in this country. 
We came from a family of immigrants 
and worked hard from an early age.”
— Victor Yanes, Pure Beauty FarmsSPOTLIGHT: MINIMIZING WASTE 
AND MAXIMIZING SELF-SUFFICIENCY 
BOOST SUPPLIER’S SUCCESS  
 
Recycling and reusing are part of the Yanes brothers’ 
business. They focus on minimizing waste and 
maximizing self-sufficiency. Pure Beauty generates its 
own compost. It uses torn-up asphalt from Miami’s 
highways as the foundation for greenhouse beds. 
The company manufactures its own greenhouses, 
which adds efficiency and speeds up recovery after 
hurricanes.
The Yaneses are thinking about who will lead Pure 
Beauty Farms in the future. Most of their children are 
in the business, and the brothers are working on a 
succession plan. “We feel blessed that The Home 
Depot has allowed us to do this for us and for our 
families,” Victor Yanes said. “You can’t get any luckier 
than that.”93

THE HOME DEPOT FOUNDATION
Support for Veterans
Since 2011, The Home Depot Foundation® 
has invested nearly $283 million to support U.S. 
veterans. In 2018, the Foundation committed an 
additional $250 million to veteran causes, taking 
the total to half a billion dollars by 2025.
Trades Training Program  
The Home Depot Foundation has pledged $50 
million to train 20,000 tradespeople by 2028 to 
help address the skilled trades labor shortage. As 
part of that commitment, the Foundation partnered 
with the Home Builders Institute (HBI) in 2017 
to launch a 12-week trades-training program 
for transitioning military members, spouses and 
veterans. Active duty military members within 180 
days of separation are eligible for the courses, 
which are taught at military bases. Participants 
pay no fees.

DISASTER RESPONSE
When natural disasters hit the communities we 
serve, Home Depot stores are among the last to 
close and first to reopen as soon as it’s safe for our 
associates to return to work. That’s how we ensure 
our customers have what they need before and 
after disaster strikes.
Our merchandising, supply chain and operations 
teams work together to get products and 
equipment to areas of impact. We connect with 
the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
state agencies, first responders, relief organizations 
and others to ensure we receive and provide 
credible information. 
At our Disaster Response Command Center in 
Atlanta, merchandising, operations and supply 
chain teams work to get truckloads of products  
and supplies to stores in areas affected by natural 
disasters, particularly hurricanes. We take pride in 
setting the example for disaster preparation and  
recovery . 
Through funds from The Home Depot Foundation 
and hands-on assistance from our crew of Team 
Depot associate volunteers, we help communities 
repair and rebuild. In 2018, The Home Depot 
Foundation gave nearly $5 million to support our 
nonprofit partners helping communities affected by 
natural disasters.

At The Home Depot, doing the right thing is 
embedded in our culture. That applies to how 
we serve customers, give back to communities, 
support our people and conduct our business. 
Our Business Code of Conduct and Ethics  
provides straightforward information about The 
Home Depot’s operating principles and offers 
tools to help associates make decisions that align 
with our ethical and legal obligations. The code 
applies to associates worldwide, and the company 
expects them to comply with the code and with 
all applicable laws and regulations in countries 
in which we do business. In particular, the code 
outlines The Home Depot’s ethical and legal 
standards in these areas:We empower associates to speak up when our 
ethical standards are not being met. We encourage 
them to voice concerns, express doubts, discuss 
problems and ask questions. In addition to sharing 
concerns with any member of their management 
team or a human resources partner, associates can 
report ethical or legal concerns to our Associate 
AwareLine, a 24/7 hotline. Reports can be made 
via thdawareline.com  or through a live operator 
available in local languages. Associates may remain 
anonymous when reporting concerns. Reports are 
handled using a case management system. We 
have a longstanding policy that prohibits retaliation 
for making a report.

The Home Depot has a long-standing 
commitment to strong corporate governance, 
which promotes the long-term interests 
of shareholders, strengthens Board and 
management accountability, and helps build 
public trust in the Company. We understand our 
responsibility to behave ethically, to understand 
the impact we have on people and communities, 
and to fairly consider the interests of a broad 
base of constituencies.
Our Board of Directors  has adopted policies 
and processes that foster effective Board 
oversight of critical matters such as strategy, 
risk management, financial and other controls, 
compliance, culture and management 
succession planning.
At least once a year, our Board discusses our 
sustainability strategy and activities, including 
this report.
Leadership Structure  
We believe having a combined chairman, CEO 
and president; an independent Lead Director; 
and Board committees composed entirely of 
independent directors currently provides the best 
Board leadership structure for The Home Depot.  
 
This structure, together with other robust 
corporate governance practices, provides strong 
independent oversight of management while 
ensuring clear strategic alignment throughout  
the company.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Our corporate governance policies reflect  
best practices:
• Annual election of directors
• Majority voting standard in director elections
• Shareholder ability to act by written consent  
and call special meetings
• Shareholder right of proxy access
• Independent Lead Director
• Over 90% of directors and all Board committee 
members are independent
• Independent directors meet without 
management
• Mandatory retirement age for directors
• Annual Board strategy session and review of  
the company’s strategic plan
• Director overboarding policy
• No shareholder rights plan, also referred to as  
a “poison pill”
• Store-walk policy for directors
• Board education and orientation program
• Management succession policy set forth in 
Corporate Governance Guidelines
• Annual Board and committee self-evaluations, 
including individual director interviews with the 
independent Lead Director

2019 Responsibility ReportBoard Committees  
Our Board of Directors has established four standing committees,  comprised solely of independent 
directors and governed by a written charter that sets forth its purpose, composition, powers, duties  
and responsibilities. 
Board Oversight of Risk  
The company has a robust framework designed to identify and ensure proper management of risk, including 
risk relating to our ability to operate responsibly and sustainably. The framework used to identify and manage 
risk considers enterprise-level issues, including competitive environment, brand and reputation, regulatory and 
compliance, and security. The framework also considers external and internal factors that could distract from 
or derail strategic objectives. The Board oversees risk through this framework, with oversight accomplished 
by identifying key risks and mapping them to the appropriate Board committee or to the full Board. 
 
Our Board reviews these key risks and the related framework annually, and the full Board or appropriate  
Board committees discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year. The table below identifies key  
risk areas overseen by the Board and its committees.
FULL BOARD
• Has primary responsibility for risk oversight, including approval of strategic objectives and defining risk appetite
• Delegates oversight of management of certain risks to Board committees
• Receives regular reports from the committees regarding risk-related matters

UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT GOALS
The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for action to end extreme poverty, fight inequality 
and injustice and protect our planet. The plan, outlined in 2015, focuses on 17 areas in which nations, 
governments, businesses and citizens can work to achieve measurable results by 2030.
 
The Home Depot shares many of the same goals, which are articulated in our core values. We aim to 
continuously improve our products, our business and our operations to benefit our customers, associates, 
suppliers and communities by building a better workplace, business and world. 
10 SDGs  ALIGN WITH THE HOME DEPOT’S SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
Good Health and Well-Being
• The Home Depot’s Eco Options 
program identifies environmentally 
preferred products for our customers. 
• Our annual health challenge engages 
associates in activities to improve their 
overall health.
Gender Equality
• Our Women’s Link associate resource 
group promotes inclusion and 
professional development for female 
associates working at the SSC.
• Our Lead-IN program supports leaders’ 
efforts to champion female talent in the 
field.
• We proudly partner with the Women’s 
Business Enterprise National Council 
to promote gender equality among our 
suppliers.
• Our Corporate Governance and Code of 
Conduct policies detail our commitment 
to workplace equality.Clean Water and Sanitation
• 100% of our in-store toilets, bath faucets 
and showerheads are high-efficiency 
products approved by the EPA’s 
WaterSense program.
• We estimate that our customers saved 
over 59 billion gallons of water in 2018 by 
properly using our water-saving products. 
• Water reclamation tanks in 145 garden 
centers in our stores conserve water use.
Affordable and Clean Energy
• We purchase enough wind-generated 
energy to power 90 stores, and we operate 
alternative energy projects — such as 
rooftop solar panels and fuel cells — at 
more than 250 stores.
• Our partnership with the EPA’s ENERGY 
STAR program enabled customers to 
purchase products capable of reducing their 
energy use by 10 billion kilowatt hours in 
2018 alone. That’s equivalent to removing 
more than 2 million cars from the road.
109
2019 Responsibility ReportLife on Land
• Our Wood Purchasing Policy helps 
ensure our suppliers and manufacturers 
support sustainable forestry. 
• In 2018, we stopped accepting wood 
products from Papau New Guinea, the 
Solomon Islands, the South American 
Amazon Basin and the African Congo 
Basin, unless the Forest Stewardship 
Council has certified the products.Responsible Consumption and 
Production
• We have set a goal to produce and 
procure 135 megawatts of energy for our 
stores through renewable or alternative 
energy sources by 2020. 
• We challenge our suppliers to offer 
products with the lowest-possible 
environmental impact and pursue third-
party certification to verify efficacy.
• Our Chemical Strategy challenges 
suppliers to eliminate suspect chemicals 
from the products we sell.
Decent Work and Economic Growth
• We employ over 400,000 associates 
internationally, and our supply chain has 
a total economic impact on millions of 
workers globally.
• We conducted 1,362 factory audits and 
1,649 follow-up visits in 2018, focusing on 
worker health, safety and well-being in our 
suppliers’ operations.
Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
• We partner with organizations such 
as the Coalition for Responsible 
Transportation Priorities. 
• We have repeatedly earned the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency’s 
SmartWay Sustained Excellence Award 
for improving freight efficiency and 
contributing to cleaner air throughout our 
supply chain.
• The Home Depot Foundation has 
pledged $50 million to help train 20,000 
tradespeople by 2028 to ease the skilled-
labor shortage.
Sustainable Cities and Communities
• In 2018, we sold over $10 billion in 
sustainable products to our customers.
• Our emergency response team offers 
direct help after natural disasters. In  
2018, we delivered more than 2,600 
shipments of disaster-relief supplies to 
affected areas.
• The Home Depot Foundation has 
committed $500 million to support 
veteran-related causes by 2025.Climate Action
• From 2009 to 2018, we reduced our

metric tonnes.
• We have a current score of “A” from 
the Carbon Disclosure Project, which 
assesses action on climate change.
• In 2018, our U.S. store energy 
consumption was 26% less than in  
2010, putting us ahead of our energy- 
use reduction goals.
