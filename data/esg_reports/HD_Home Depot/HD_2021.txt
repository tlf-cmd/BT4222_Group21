We organize our approach 
to corporate responsibility 
around three key pillars: 
focusing on our people, 
operating sustainably 
and strengthening our 
communities.CEO LETTER
DOING OUR PART MAKES 
OUR COMPANY STRONGER
When our founders opened the first Home 
Depot store, they did so with a well-defined 
culture. More than 40 years later, our eight 
core values and our commitment to put 
customers and associates first are still the 
lens through which we view every decision. 
So, running a responsible and sustainable 
company is foundational to our business. 
Doing our part creates value for all of our 
stakeholders.  
We all know 2020 was filled with challenges 
as the world navigated a pandemic, people 
protested across the globe and we felt 
the effects of record-setting wildfires in 
the West and the most active Atlantic 
hurricane season ever. For The Home Depot, 
the events of 2020 highlighted, perhaps 
more than ever, the critical importance of 
our culture. This report captures how we 
responded with fortitude to a year like no 
other — and made progress along the way.
We navigated this unprecedented 
environment by aligning our decisions 
and actions to two of our most important 
values: doing the right thing and taking 
care of our people. We adjusted our 
business to promote safe shopping and 
working environments. We supported our 
communities by contributing over $50 million 
in funds and supplies to support community 
needs during COVID-19.
In fiscal 2020, we invested approximately  
$2 billion in enhanced pay and benefits 
to help alleviate some of the challenges 
associates faced because of the pandemic. 
We’ve now transitioned to permanent 
compensation enhancements for our front-
line, hourly associates. The outstanding 
performance of our people in 2020 also resulted in record Success Sharing awards 
for non-management associates, adding up 
to approximately $616 million.
We continued to focus on our people by 
furthering workplace diversity and inclusion. 
Respect for all people has always been 
one of our core values, and 20 years ago 
we formalized diversity and inclusion as a 
corporate initiative. In 2020, we enhanced 
our efforts with a focus on equity and 
renamed our program Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion (DEI). We also elevated the chief 
diversity officer role to drive strategic focus 
and alignment across our business. In 
2020, over 35% of our hires were women, 
and nearly 53% were ethnically and racially 
diverse. We’re proud of that progress, but 
we know there is more work to do. We are 
intentional in striving for improvement.
We also made progress in 2020 by operating 
more sustainably, including by reducing 
electricity consumption in our U.S. stores 
more than 14% year over year. We’ve cut 
U.S. store electricity use a remarkable 
44% since 2010. This far exceeds the goal 
we set a few years ago to reduce store 
kilowatt-hour electricity use 20% by 2020. 
That’s a big reason we are on track to meet 
our science-based target, set in 2020, to 
decrease our emissions to achieve 40% 
reduction by 2030 and 50% reduction by 
2035. In addition, we’ve committed to having 
100% renewable electricity for all Home 
Depot facilities worldwide by 2030.
Since our founding, supporting our 
communities has been central to our 
business — not only in moments of crisis, 
but through initiatives that build strength 
over the long term. For example, in 2020, 5
2021 ESG Report     The Home Depot
we increased our spending with diverse 
suppliers, further investing in businesses that 
provide The Home Depot with innovative 
products and create jobs in the communities 
we serve. We value the fresh ideas and 
entrepreneurial spirit our diverse suppliers 
bring to our partnerships.
We also value our nonprofit partners that 
enable The Home Depot Foundation to 
improve the homes and lives of U.S. veterans, 
train skilled tradespeople to fill the labor gap 
and support communities affected by natural 
disasters. The Foundation is on track to 
contribute half of a billion dollars to veteran 
causes by 2025. In 2020, we reached a 
milestone of $350 million toward that goal.
We know that when we invest in running a 
responsible, sustainable company, we make 
our business stronger, more flexible and 
more resilient. I am incredibly proud of all we 
accomplished in 2020 and want to thank our 
associates for the many ways they enable us 
to do our part and live our values every day. – Craig Menear, Chairman and CEO“Running a responsible 
and sustainable company is 
foundational to our business. 
Doing our part creates value 
for all of our stakeholders.”

ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS  
& SETTING PRIORITIES
One of the best ways of understanding our 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
impact is by listening to and talking with our 
broad spectrum of stakeholders. We seek 
out this dialogue with stakeholders and 
welcome ESG-related feedback that comes 
to us in multiple ways.  
 
Customers ask us questions every day 
as they shop with us in stores and online. 
Individuals and organizations from around 
the globe reach out to us with questions 
or concerns about our operations or 
products. We meet with shareholders and 
nongovernmental organization (NGOs) 
interested in our business practices. We take 
part in industry efforts to raise awareness 
about the ESG responsibilities we all share.
Our ongoing interactions may be formal 
or informal, as detailed in our Materiality 
Assessment Framework on Page 8 . These 
interactions help validate our own materiality 
assessment; they also help us gauge the 
impact of our business, refine ESG priorities, 
measure our progress and design ways  
to improve.By better understanding our impact and 
collaborating with stakeholders, we position 
our company to set objectives that allow us 
to contribute to building a better business, 
workplace and world.
Our Sustainability Council, composed of 
representatives from different areas of 
the business, oversees our approach to 
sustainability. Members of the Council share 
stakeholder feedback from their functional 
areas. The Council focuses on several key 
areas, as shown below.
The Council meets twice a year, and its 
chair presents our sustainability strategy 
and activities to the Board of Directors 
annually. Our ESG priorities and plans are 
communicated internally and externally via 
various channels, including in this annual 
report.
 We value seeing ESG 
impact and opportunities 
through our operational 
lens and also through the 
lenses of our stakeholders.

This chart highlights The Home Depot’s key ESG metrics. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on many 2020 results. For example, 
customer demand and supply chain volume rose substantially. In addition, we saw a decline in some materials collected from customers 
through our in-store recycling programs. We also temporarily halted Team Depot community volunteer projects and associate fundraising 
for The Homer Fund. Data from 2018 reflects the calendar year. Data for 2019 and 2020 reflects the fiscal year, except as otherwise 
noted. For detailed diversity, equity and inclusion data, see pages 28-31 .15

Chief Sustainability Officer Ron Jarvis has 
spent two decades driving sustainability 
improvements at The Home Depot. Some of 
the frequently asked questions he responds 
to offer insights into our progress.FAQ: GROWING 
SUSTAINABLY
When we make progress 
in reducing The Home 
Depot’s environmental 
impact, we strengthen 
our business and the 
communities we serve.How are you reducing carbon 
emissions related to company 
operations?
We have made strides in decreasing 
emissions across our business. Our 
U.S. stores cut electricity consumption 
more than 14% year over year in 
2020 through our diligent efforts to 
find electricity savings storewide. LED 
lighting upgrades were a big part of that 
success. Go to Page 56  to find out how 
we’re saving electricity in our stores.
In 2020, we moved more products than 
ever as customers turned to us for 
appliances, air-conditioning systems, 
cleaning products and other essentials. 
As we managed a 20% increase in What are you doing about the 
environmental impact of products 
sold at The Home Depot?
We understand that our biggest impact 
on the environment comes from 
the products we sell. We continue 
to work with our suppliers to make 
products more sustainable through 
improvements in materials sourcing, 
chemistry, packaging, manufacturing 
and distribution. We track the product-
related emissions embedded in 
manufacturing, distribution and our Q.

our previously planned operational 
improvements. The energy-saving, 
emissions-reducing efficiencies we’ve 
gained in recent years helped decrease 
our carbon intensity. In 2020, we 
achieved a 22% reduction in the amount 
of carbon dioxide emitted for each 
dollar of revenue we earned, compared 
to 2019. Learn more on Page 54.19
2021 ESG Report     The Home DepotThe Home Depot achieved 
several of its stated 
environmental goals in 2020. 
Walk us through that progress.
As outlined in our Goals section ( see 
Page 12 ), our company in 2020:
• Exceeded our goal to reduce U.S. 
store kilowatt-hour electricity use 
20%, compared to 2010 levels. We 
actually cut electricity consumption 
in our U.S. stores 44% between 
2010 and 2020.
• Completed our goal to procure 
or produce 135 megawatts of 
renewable or alternative energy. 
We’ve now set even more ambitious 
goals, including adding 200 
megawatts in a pledge to buy 
or generate 335 megawatts of 
renewable or alternative energy by 
2025.
• Achieved our goals to help 
customers save $2.8 billion on utility What sustainability trend excites 
you the most for its near-term 
potential?
Waste reduction through circularity. 
Through years of manufacturing, we 
now have an abundance of resources 
that can be repurposed, recycled and 
reused to produce new products. With 
the support of our suppliers, The Home 
Depot is continually searching for 
ways to use these existing resources 
to drive efficiency and reduce waste. 
Our partnership with Trex is a great 
example. We send our plastic waste to 
Trex — including more than 8,000 tons 
of plastic shrink wrap every year. Trex 
transforms it into decking that doesn’t 
rely on wood. Learn more on Page 7 5.Q.

emissions by 20 million metric tons

• Achieved our goal to help 
customers reduce their water

through the purchase and proper 
use of the water-saving products 
we sell.

In 2020, we pledged to intensify our efforts 
as a company to make a meaningful, 
sustainable difference in accordance 
with our value of respect for all people. 
While we’ve long had a formal diversity 
and inclusion program to help diversify 
our workforce and support change in our 
communities, we expanded the scope in 
2020 and renamed it to fit an enhanced 
mission: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI).
Adding equity to our focus reflects our 
desire to promote fairness, remove bias 
and ensure all of our associates have 
access to the resources they need to 
succeed at work. 
During this time, we elevated the role 
of Derek Bottoms, vice president of 
associate relations, to also serve as our 
chief diversity officer to bolster leadership 
of these efforts. (Meet Derek on the 
opposite page.) We additionally laid the 
foundation to further grow our team and 
develop a roadmap for progress. At The 
Home Depot, we define diversity, equity 
and inclusion as:
Diversity:  Composition of people, such 
as their similarities and differences (e.g., 
gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation).
Equity:  Norms, practices and policies 
in place that ensure just and fair 
opportunities and outcomes, allowing 
individuals to reach their full potential. 
Inclusion:  How we embrace and enable 
our associates to feel safe, respected, 
engaged, motivated and valued for who 
they are and their contributions to the 
organization.In 2020, we established three key areas of 
focus to create change and make a bigger 
impact.
ASSOCIATES
• Increasing diverse representation 
throughout our organization
• Creating an environment where every 
associate feels included and valued 
for who they are
• Promoting equal opportunity 
in recruitment, hiring, training, 
development and advancement
COMMUNITY
• Striving to close the wealth gap
• Advancing education for all
SUPPLIERS
• Increasing our penetration and spend 
with diverse suppliers
• Developing diverse suppliers by 
providing mentorship and shared 
resources
Learn more about how our spending with 
diverse suppliers benefits our company 
and our communities on Page 100 .  
 
In 2021, we are taking thoughtful actions 
in each of these three focus areas and 
related strategic priorities to create 
meaningful change.DIVERSITY, EQUITY &  
INCLUSION
We strive to create an 
environment centered on 
our core value of respect 
for all people, where 
diversity, equity and 
inclusion fuel associate 
engagement and career 
growth.

2021 ESG Report     The Home Depot
Derek Bottoms, chief diversity officer and 
vice president of associate relations, gives 
his take on our expanded focus on DEI.
Q: Is The Home Depot thinking differently 
about diversity now?
A: We are a values-based organization, and 
our values have always guided our business 
decisions and the way we treat each other. For 
The Home Depot, diversity has always been 
important. The highlight on social injustice 
and the resulting events following the death 
of George Floyd created a fierce urgency, 
and that reinforced our focus on supporting 
diversity, equity and inclusion among our 
associates, communities and suppliers.
Q: How is that urgency turning into action? 
A: Our expanded focus on diversity, equity 
and inclusion has laid the groundwork for 
three key areas centered on our associates, 
community partnerships and supplier diversity. 
As we grow our team, I am confident in the 
direction that our convictions, capabilities and 
tools will take us to enable our people and our 
company to make a lasting difference.
Q: What are some ways that we are 
making a positive impact on our associates, 
communities and suppliers?
A: For our associates, our team is working 
cross-functionally on initiatives including 
development and training; associate resource 
group (ARG) and diversity business council 
programming; discussions with subject matter 
experts on driving inclusivity; and recruiting 
and talent planning strategies designed to 
eliminate bias.Through our partnerships with community 
organizations focusing on arts, housing, 
education and entrepreneurship, we are striving 
to play our part in helping close the wealth 
gap and advancing education for all. And we 
are expanding our supplier diversity program, 
which we believe ultimately drives innovation, 
economic opportunities and shareholder value. 
Q: What are some of the projects you’re most 
excited about?
A: We’re expanding our associate resource 
groups and diversity business councils to include 
and engage more associates, growing the 
programs from our Store Support Center to our 
stores and supply chain facilities. (Learn more 
about ARGs on Page 35 .) 
 
We’re also laying the foundation for a Tier 
II supplier diversity program to create more 
economic opportunities for diverse businesses, 
including our existing supplier partners. Here’s 
how that can make a difference. Our Tier I 
suppliers are those we spend with directly. Those 
dollars that begin with The Home Depot go 
on to fuel our suppliers’ spending with other 
companies. Encouraging our suppliers to spend 
with diverse businesses, and tracking that 
spending, is the essence of the Tier II supplier 
diversity program we’re developing. Through 
this program, we’ll work to better ensure that 
a portion of the money we spend on products 
and services, even with suppliers that are not 
identified as diverse, makes its way to diverse 
businesses.
The Home Depot is building 
a more diverse, equitable 
and inclusive organization, 
within our enterprise and the 
communities we are proud to 
serve. Grounded in our core 
values, we have the conviction, 
capabilities and tools to make 
a difference for our associates, 
community and suppliers.Vision Statement

CREATING A SECOND-HOME 
WORKPLACE
District manager’s front-line experience informs her approach to leadership. Creating an inclusive, caring 
environment is job No. 1.
henell Leighton spent six 
years as a Home Depot 
hourly associate before 
she took her first salaried 
job. Although she’s been in leadership 
roles for 15 years, currently as district 
manager of several New York metro 
stores, that time on the front lines 
stays with her.
“Every time I’m in a store, I see 
myself as a cashier ringing up the 
register at the Valley Stream store 
where I started,” says Shenell, whose 
District 332 in Queens includes about 
1,700 associates. “My experience 
shapes how I lead. I am aware of the 
obstacles, as well as the opportunities.
“I was always self-aware that my 
actions and contributions were paving 
the way for other women and people 
of color,” Shenell says. She welcomes 
the company’s enhanced focus on 
diversity, equity and inclusion and 
believes our recent conversations 
about race, gender and equity are 
powerful and can be transformative. 
“We are talking openly about our 
experiences. We are talking about 
what’s difficult — and not just in one-
on-one conversations with mentors 
we trust, but in larger settings in our 
workplace. That open conversation 
is the thing that can make positive 
change happen,” she says. “That’s 
huge.”
Also essential: Putting equity front and 
center. “Becoming a salaried manager 
at The Home Depot changed my 
life. My first management incentive 
payment helped me erase my debt. 
It’s important that we give our people 
access to resources that enable 
them to succeed at work and build Sgenerational wealth. We also must 
offer associates the financial literacy 
tools they need to learn about growing 
their money. That may not have been 
part of their foundation growing up. It’s 
something I had to learn.” (Go to Page 
40 to learn more about financial literacy 
tools available to associates.)
The pandemic has put a spotlight 
on the challenges associates face 
in their daily lives, Shenell says, and 
also highlighted their fortitude. “I think 
about what our people have personally 
been through in their lives at home 
with their loved ones since March 2020 
— death, sickness, job losses in the 
family, struggles with home-schooling 
— that all happens before they walk 
into work. And, still, through resilience 
and determination, they make it to the 
store, and they treat it like a second 
home.”
Shenell believes a critical part of 
her job as a leader is to make sure 
that “second home” is a place 
where all associates are welcomed 
and included. She wants all our 
people, especially associates from 
underrepresented minority groups and 
women, to have the resources they 
need to ascend and create brighter 
futures for their families, as she has. 
“If we are intentional in our purposes, 
as a company and as individuals, we 
can chart our own path.”
Shenell Leighton
District Manager, Queens,  
New York“It’s important that 
we give our people 
access to resources 
that enable them to 
succeed at work and 
build generational 
wealth.”28

BUILDING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE
Our diverse workforce of approximately 500,000 associates strengthens our competitive advantages and reflects the customers 
and communities we serve. A comparison against U.S. Department of Labor data shows that our workforce is more ethnically 
diverse than the nation’s working population. These charts reflect the demographics of The Home Depot’s U.S. workforce from 
2018 through 2020. Data sets from 2018 reflect the calendar year. Newer data reflects the fiscal year. Certain percentages may 
not sum to totals due to rounding or some associates choosing not to self-identify by race/ethnicity or gender. Prior year data 
has been updated based on new reporting systems and to conform to current year presentation.

hristine Botnick already had 
a full-time retail job when she 
started working at Store 249 in 
Oakland Park, Florida. But she 
needed more money for rent, groceries and 
college tuition.
She was 19, on her own and living 
paycheck to paycheck, just as her parents 
had always done. But Christine wanted 
to do better. That’s why she was pursuing 
a degree in psychology, on her way to 
becoming the first person in her family to 
graduate from college. And that’s why, 
when her Home Depot manager suggested 
she stretch beyond her part-time role in the 
paint department, she listened. Christine 
increased her hours, quit that other retail 
job, and 18 months later became a paint 
department supervisor.
“I just really felt, for the first time in my life, 
that other people were interested in seeing 
me succeed,” Christine recalls. “They saw 
past my age and offered me an opportunity 
and the means to build an income and a 
better life for myself. They saw that I had 
potential, even when I didn’t.”
That was 2003. By the end of 2006, 
Christine was a 22-year-old assistant store 
manager. In 2011, she became a district 
services manager in South Florida. Three 
years later, she was promoted to store 
manager and ultimately led three Florida 
stores, in Sunrise, Punta Gorda and Miami 
Gardens. (Along the way, she earned that 
college degree.)
Then, in 2020, as our company was facing 
a huge surge in online orders, another 
Home Depot leader suggested that 
Christine take another stretch assignment 
— this time in supply chain. Today, she 
leads more than 700 associates as the CAssociate Christine Botnick got her start as a part-timer selling paint. Now she leads hundreds of supply chain 
associates. Her career demonstrates that embracing diversity, equity and inclusion fuels success, and she is 
committed to representing LGBTQ, women and minority associates climbing The Home Depot ladder.PRACTICING DIVERSITY  
EVERY DAYSPOTLIGHT
general manager of our Tracy, California, 
rapid deployment center. 
Christine’s career climb brought her what 
she wanted: economic security, upward 
mobility and a job she loves. But it also 
delivered something she hadn’t expected 
and now treasures. It turned her into a 
trailblazer. 
“Every time I got a promotion, it sparked 
a great deal of conversation with other 
female associates. They asked me how 
I did it. Then they started applying for 
higher-level jobs, too, and getting them,” 
Christine says. “That’s when I realized 
that success is contagious.”
Embracing her distinction as a trailblazer, 
Christine became diversity and inclusion 
captain in every store she worked. She 
found her own role models, too, among 
them, Laura Mathe, who started as an 
assistant general manager in our Ontario, 
California, rapid deployment center and 
rose through the ranks to her current role 
as senior director of operations leading 
our Western RDCs. Laura is one of 11 
SDOs companywide. Another role model 
for Christine is Hector Padilla, who  
began as an hourly store associate in 
Hialeah, Florida, in 1994, and now is 
executive vice president leading our 
Outside Sales & Service business.“What I can do 
every single day is 
set the tone and the 
intentional, deliberate 
focus so that leaders 
who work under me 
understand that 
diversity, equity and 
inclusion is important 
to the company and 
to me.”
Christine Botnick
General Manager, Tracy RDC33
2021 ESG Report     The Home Depot
When Christine became a store 
manager, she transformed routine 
workforce diversity reports into a call 
to action and focused on hiring and 
promoting associates to better reflect the 
communities that the stores served. 
“Once I got to a leadership position, I 
asked myself, ‘What can I do with my 
podium?’ The answer,” she says, “was to 
make sure the day-to-day actions under 
my direction aligned with The Home 
Depot’s core values.”
Christine describes herself as an atypical 
corporate leader. She’s under 40, gay 
and covered in tattoos. She grew up in a 
tough, impoverished environment. That’s 
why, she says, her success is bigger than 
she is. It gives others hope. “I have a 
responsibility to represent,” she says. 
“I look at the data and think, ‘Where can 
we do more?’ Our stores and supply 
chain facilities should look like the 
demographics of the communities where 
they operate,” Christine says. “We’ve got 
to get women deeper into the stores and 
higher up into management.” (See The 
Home Depot’s workplace diversity data  
on Page 28 .)Business has to come first, which 
in Christine’s case means keeping 
associates safe as they work on 
the supply chain front lines during 
a pandemic, and keeping products 
flowing to the more than 100 stores 
across four states served by the Tracy 
RDC. Nonetheless, she finds a way to 
make diversity, equity and inclusion a 
daily priority.
“What I can do every single day is set 
the tone and the intentional, deliberate 
focus so that leaders who work under 
me understand that diversity, equity and 
inclusion is important to the company 
and to me,” Christine says. “Then 
it becomes important to them, too, 
and influences how they manage and 
advance our people.” 
She remembers what it’s like to be on 
the bottom rung of the ladder — as a 
19-year-old store associate worried 
about making ends meet and unsure 
about the future. “That part-time 
associate selling paint is always in my 
head. I want to make sure the people 
who are on our front lines today get the 
same opportunities that I did. That’s 
how I pay it forward.”
 Christine Botnick’s guidance 
for leaders aiming to foster 
diversity, equity and inclusion: 
Make it an everyday mindset.
• Recognize the value of a 
diverse workforce, which 
brings fresh ideas, sparks 
innovation, aligns The Home 
Depot with our customers 
and communities and helps 
us avoid groupthink.
• Build a broad, diverse 
network inside The Home 
Depot, at all levels, and also 
in your community.
• Talk to and listen to people 
you don’t necessarily 
agree with; that’s where 
real conversation and 
understanding begins. 
• Keep an open mind, and  
be willing to amend your 
point of view. How to Practice DEI  
with Intention

ASSOCIATE  
ENGAGEMENT
Voice of the Associate Survey
Highly engaged associates care about 
their work and the performance of The 
Home Depot. Our passion is to create an 
engaging and inclusive workplace; we do 
so by proactively listening and responding 
to associate feedback.  
In 2020, to alleviate one of the pressures 
on associates as they took care of 
customers and one another, we suspended 
our annual companywide Voice of the 
Associate survey. Instead, we invited 
associates working in U.S. stores and 
distribution centers to complete an 
optional online pulse survey to ensure 
there was still an opportunity to provide 
feedback. We used internal communication 
channels and QR code posters to raise 
awareness about the survey.
The survey specifically asked about 
associates’ workplace experiences 
during the pandemic, and the feedback 
we received was extremely encouraging. 
Associates felt supported by their 
supervisors and by the company’s flexible 
scheduling to help them balance work and 
personal lives during the pandemic. An 
overwhelming majority also said they were 
proud to work for The Home Depot.
Engagement Platform
In 2020, we began transitioning to a new 
associate engagement platform, launching 
Yammer at the end of our fiscal year. The 
shift creates new opportunities for us to 
reach associates via on-site desktops 
or on-the-go mobile devices. More than 
450,000 associates across the U.S. and 
Canada have access to Yammer.  
 Associate engagement is 
the emotional commitment 
associates have to our 
company and our goals. It is 
vital to The Home Depot’s 
culture and success.With over 900 communities in the network, 
the digital hub links associates to local 
co-workers and colleagues across North 
America who share common interests — 
everything from remodeling and volunteerism 
to food and movies. Associates can keep up 
with company news, connect to corporate 
leaders, cultivate their creativity and fuel their 
orange-blooded entrepreneurial spirit.  
 
Success Sharing and  
Compensation Enhancements   
Our philosophy of taking care of our people 
and motivating them to deliver a superior 
customer experience shapes our profit-
sharing program for hourly associates. 
Success Sharing provides semi-annual cash 
awards for performance against our business 
plan, including sales and productivity goals. 
The program has granted awards totaling 
more than $1 billion to associates over the 
last three years.
The outstanding performance of our 
associates in fiscal 2020 enabled 100% 
of stores to qualify for Success Sharing in 
both the first and second half of the year. 
This resulted in record award payments 
to our non-management associates of 
approximately $616 million.
In 2020, we invested approximately  
$2 billion in enhanced associate pay and 
benefits for front-line, hourly associates 
in response to COVID-19. In the third 
quarter of 2020, we began transitioning to 
permanent compensation enhancements 
that could add up to approximately $1 billion 
on an annualized basis. We also continued 
merit-based salary increases and matching 
contributions under our FutureBuilder  
401(k) Plan.  DID YOU KNOW

Associate Resource Groups
Our associate resource groups  (ARGs) are led by 
associates and sponsored by executive leaders. They 
drive associate engagement and promote inclusion at  
our Store Support Center through:
• Professional development
• Cultural awareness
• Community outreach
We have seven ARGs, each of which support the 
company’s business objectives and policies, particularly 
those related to developing our associates, creating 
diversity awareness and engaging diverse community 
partners.  
 
ARG engagement expanded significantly in 2020, as 
many Store Support Center associates worked remotely 
because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hosted more 
than 70 ARG events virtually to celebrate diversity, raise 
cultural awareness and foster professional development.Caring Conversations
We launched Caring Conversations in 2020 in response to 
the unrest in our communities. These panel discussions 
featured honest and candid stories about race and 
ethnicity from senior leadership at the company, as well 
as lectures from subject-matter experts on civil rights, 
law, voting and more. Associate teams also held smaller 
discussions on these topics within their groups.  
 
We hosted six Caring Conversations in 2020, attracting 
approximately 25,000 associates. These diversity 
discussions have been expanded to new formats in 2021.

Aligning Work and Health Yields 40-Year Career
The Home Depot’s summer 2020 internships quickly transitioned from in-office 
opportunities to fully remote professional development experiences. More than 200 
interns completed the program — about half from our stores, distribution centers and 
contact centers. 
Michael Villegas, a merchandising execution team (MET) associate at Store 6960 in 
Fontana, California, nabbed an internship and worked on a project with meaningful  
impact for the company.
“I created a public relations strategy to raise awareness among consumers and Pros 
about our efforts to help fill the labor gap through trades training,”  Michael says. His 
project plugged into a key Home Depot priority: fostering career opportunities in our 
communities and supporting our industry by helping to increase the number of skilled 
carpenters, plumbers, electricians and more in the workforce. (Learn more on Page 10 5.)
Michael, who for two years fit college classes around his MET schedule, graduated in 
December 2020. He is now is a PR specialist at the Store Support Center. “The  
company had my back and gave me an opportunity to excel,” he says.Associate Intern Boosts Awareness of Trades Training

DID YOU KNOW
In 2020, nearly 45% of our summer internship team was ethnically/racially diverse, and nearly a third of our interns were women.Associate Chris Owens’ Home Depot career began in 1981, after he showed up 
repeatedly at an Atlanta store seeking work. As Chris describes it, he wore the manager 
down and landed a job in lumber. He rose up the ranks, working in the aisles and driving 
delivery and distribution trucks, until, in May 1992, he fell 60 feet while trimming trees 
at his home. Chris broke his neck and was paralyzed from the collar bone down. Life had 
to change.
After months in the hospital, where visits from fellow associates — including the 
company’s founders — buoyed his spirits and resolve, Chris went to work in a 
distribution center managing office operations and dispatch. He ultimately was 
promoted to the Store Support Center team in a leadership role. But a person in a 
wheelchair needs to keep moving, and the job involved long hours and too much sitting. 
Chris developed a life-threatening skin wound. His doctor told him he had to work less 
to preserve his health. Life had to change again.
Chris changed course and brought his institutional knowledge, skills and relationships to 
a logistics planning team. He gained backup, camaraderie and the ability to prioritize his 
well-being. 
While he refuses to be defined by limitations, Chris believes it’s his responsibility to 
represent other associates with disabilities and the benefits of adapting careers to 
support inclusion. “I am living proof that you can do anything within The Home Depot 
that you want to,” he says. “There’s something out there for you.”38

OPPORTUNITY AMID 
ADVERSITY
As is true for everyone, everywhere, life 
changed dramatically in 2020 for associate 
Ijumaa Shelton. The difference for Ijumaa, 
though, was that life largely got better.
Ijumaa, who works at our direct fulfillment 
center in Troy, Ohio, paid off his credit card 
debt, helped a friend find work, treated 
himself to a new computer and gave a little 
financial support to family members. He 
began to see himself as a potential leader 
and to think of his two years on our supply 
chain front lines as the start of a career.
Amid all the chaos, sorrow and anxiety 
created by COVID-19, the pandemic also 
created opportunity. The Home Depot 
stayed open to serve our communities as 
an essential retailer, just as we’ve always 
done during natural disasters. Customers 
suddenly spending much more time at home 
turned to us for air conditioners, appliances, 
cleaning supplies, lumber, light bulbs and 
much more.
As a result, the supply chain growth that our 
company had expected to see over several 
years happened in just a few months. The 
Troy DFC asked existing associates to work 
more if they could. Ijumaa went from three 
12-hour shifts a week to clocking in for 
six — and received double pay for overtime 
hours. (Learn more about pandemic-related 
associate pay and benefits on Page 42 .) He 
expanded from inventory control to inbound 
and outbound operations.“It was just an insane amount of volume, 
and I realized that this was an opportunity 
that might never present itself again,” 
Ijumaa says. “I had to take advantage of it.”
He used his first few paychecks to pay off 
every one of his credit cards. “That was 
such a huge weight off my shoulders,” he 
recalls. Then he bought himself the parts 
for a video-gaming computer and bought 
his sister a baby crib.
He persuaded a friend who had lost his job 
because of COVID to come work at the 
Troy DFC. Ijumaa’s pitch: The pay is good, 
and The Home Depot is a place where you 
can grow a career. That’s something Ijumaa 
understands better than ever. He’s jumping 
at opportunities his bosses offer him to take 
on higher-level responsibilities. “Because of 
what happened in 2020, I’ve done almost 
every role at my level at the Troy DFC,” he 
says. “I think I can do more.”

FOCUSING ON THOSE  
WHO SERVE
Military service members and military spouses are resilient, resourceful and team-minded. Supporting them 
is the right thing to do for our communities and our company.
erving military members, 
veterans and their families has 
been fundamental at The Home 
Depot from the start. Our 
Military Relations department, launched in 
2019 and expanded in 2020, fine-tunes that 
focus to make our company an even better 
resource for those who serve, especially our 
many military-affiliated associates.
Raukshaun Pickens’ experience 
demonstrates how we support military 
associates when they’re deployed. While 
much of the world hunkered down, he 
reported for duty on multiple fronts.
In March 2020, the supply chain associate 
and combat medic in the Army National 
Guard deployed to an overwhelmed 
hospital in rural Georgia to treat COVID-19 
patients. Then he was called to the streets 
of Atlanta to keep the peace during protests 
demanding social change. After that, 
Raukshaun helped run COVID testing — 
and, on July 4, tested positive for the virus 
himself.
After completing his missions, Raukshaun 
returned to our direct fulfillment center in 
Locust Grove, Georgia, in November. Back 
on the job as production planning manager, 
he navigated record levels of customer 
demand with the characteristic calm that 
has earned respect from his co-workers. 
He attributes his on-the-job tranquility to 
13 years in the military, including a tour 
in Afghanistan. “Work stress seems very 
manageable once you’ve been through 
combat,” he says.
Every time he has been called to duty 
during his six years with our company, 
The Home Depot’s support of his service 
and his career never faltered, Raukshaun 
says. “My direct managers, HR, payroll 
— everyone has been super supportive. 
My manager has checked in on my wife Sand kids,” he says. “My leaders are open 
to having conversations with me about 
making sure my military service won’t derail 
my career plans.
“It’s a night-and-day difference between 
the support I get at The Home Depot and 
the stories I hear from some of my fellow 
guard members,” says Raukshaun, who 
has recruited some of those fellow soldiers 
to our company. “I can’t think of a company 
that is better than ours at dealing with 
employees’ military deployments.”

SPOTLIGHT
COVID CARE KIT ENABLED 
LIFE-SAVING HEALTH CHECK
Crucial tool for measuring oxygen alerted associate’s family that their father needed emergency care.
alvador Vaca Jr. was 
feeling pretty rotten 
when his COVID Care 
Kit arrived. Sal, a store 
associate in Aurora, Colorado, was 
quarantining at home after contracting 
the coronavirus. His brother left the 
package from The Home Depot outside 
Sal’s bedroom door. Down the hall, 
Sal’s 64-year-old father, Salvador Vaca 
Sr., also was sick with the virus.
In the Home Depot-branded bag were 
creature comforts and some health-
check devices, including a pulse 
oximeter that measures how efficiently 
blood is carrying oxygen through the 
body. During the pandemic, it has been 
a crucial tool for understanding in real 
time how the virus is weakening the 
respiratory system.
Sal texted a photo of the kit’s contents 
to his sister, who works in health care. 
She texted back: “I need Dad to check 
his oxygen.” Sal put the pulse oximeter 
outside his bedroom door. His brother S
COVID-19 CARE KITtook it to Sal’s father, who used it to 
measure his blood-oxygen level, which 
was at 75% and dropping — well 
below the healthy mark of 95% and 
above.
Sal’s father went to the hospital and 
stayed there for eight days. Hospital 
staff told the family that their father 
survived because of their quick 
response to his deteriorating condition.
In Sal’s view, that package from The 
Home Depot deserves some credit, 
too. “The care kit helped us save our 
dad’s life,” he says. “It came at the 
perfect time — when we needed it the 
most. For this I will always be grateful.”

When in-person classes abruptly stopped at her son’s school last spring, Miracle 
Palmer, a store associate in San Antonio, Texas, thought the disruption would last a 
couple of weeks. But those weeks turned into months.  
Miracle needed to stay home to make sure Joel, who’s autistic, got the care and 
engagement he needed during the day. “I had to help him with virtual learning. But 
the real concern was the well-being of my son,” she says. “I was not able to return 
to work, and, financially, that put a strain on us.”  
Overwhelmed, she contacted The Homer Fund and got connected with a 
representative. “I kind of just broke down to her and just told her all the concerns 
that I was trying to hold together,” Miracle recalls. The response, a grant to pay 
essential bills as she home-schooled her son, “blew away” her expectations.  
“With The Homer Fund money, we paid for our electric bill. We paid a water bill.

ASSOCIATE SAFETY
The Home Depot strives to provide a safe 
working and shopping environment for our 
associates and customers. An important 
way we do this is by raising awareness 
of risks among both front-line associates 
and leaders. When our people are 
trained to recognize and correct hazards, 
our workplace is primed for continual 
improvement.  
 
In 2020, we pivoted from InFocus sessions 
on traditional workplace safety issues to 
engaging and educating associates about 
how to keep themselves and our customers 
safe during the pandemic. 
Simplifying Safety
Our communications platform delivers real-
time information and uses multiple types 
of media to accommodate associates’ 
preferences and learning styles. We simplify 
messaging to highlight the most frequent 
and severe hazards.  
 
In 2020, we introduced quarterly campaigns 
with facts and statistics to illustrate the 
prevalence of safety concerns, offer risk-
reduction strategies and provide hands-on 
exercises for injury prevention. Our store 
and supply chain leaders set the tone, and 
our experience shows our associates will 
rally around their leaders’ safety messages. 
To leverage this, in 2020 we facilitated 
direct safety talks from regional leaders 
to associates in their organizations. This 
messaging personalized our companywide 
efforts to increase workplace safety.Our people are our most 
important asset. By 
focusing on workplace 
safety training and 
risk reduction, we help 
keep our associates and 
customers injury-free.Preventing Injuries
We partnered with ergonomists on a 
program to prevent lifting injuries, which are 
among the most frequent types of injuries in 
our industry. The result was Lift It Close To 
Home, instruction that uses a lift-and-place 
target to show associates how to minimize 
strain on their shoulders and backs. 
Reducing Risk
Our Store Support Center and field teams 
work to engineer out risks and make our 
environments safer for associates and 
customers. Recent improvements included 
resurfacing and restriping customer parking 
lots and using lightweight, stackable plastic 
pallets to unload freight. These kinds of 
simple solutions can have a big impact on 
our progress in creating a safer place to 
work and shop.  
 
In 2020, 84 Home Depot stores joined our 
Club 365, meaning they operated all year 
without a significant safety incident.

he mission was to reduce our 
front-line associates’ exposure 
to COVID-19, and do it ASAP . 
In nine days, our store design 
team — first meeting virtually, then drafting 
blueprints in an associate’s basement-
turned-workshop, and finally building 
models after hours in a couple of Georgia 
stores — created a plexiglass shield that 
is now protecting thousands of our people 
every day.
For associate Chad Thompson, a member 
of our in-store environment team, the 
assignment was both professional and 
personal. He was determined to find 
a sustainable, functional way to better 
safeguard associates against the virus. One 
of the associates he wanted to protect was 
his daughter, Atley Thompson, who works 
on the customer service desk at Store 1777 
in Kennesaw, Georgia.
“It was mid-March 2020, and at that point, 
nobody really knew for sure what the 
coronavirus was and how it spread. But 
if there was even a small chance that a 
plexiglass shield could block those germs, 
we needed to find a way to do it,” Chad 
recalls. The question was how to design 
shields that would work in our stores. 
The shields would need to withstand 
run-ins with carts piled with heavy goods 
like lumber. They had to improve safety, 
not interfere with it. They needed to 
allow accessibility and maneuverability 
for associates and customers using 
wheelchairs and other adaptive devices.
The shields also had to look like they 
belonged in both our new and legacy stores 
— not like slapdash plastic sheeting. And 
the shields had to be easy to assemble, 
using tools available in every store, so 
associates could install them with speed, 
preferably in a single shift.
The team began what Chad — a seven-
year associate — calls “The Home Depot 
sprint.” That means we throw resources TIn a perfect example of ‘The Home Depot sprint,’ we brought together the right people and the right partners to 
create long-lasting, good-looking shields to help protect front-line associates.PROTECTION BY DESIGNSPOTLIGHT
at a problem and move fast. Chad and 
colleagues Mark McGlon, Cary Outlaw, 
Robery Windisch and Sarmistha Boal, 
who leads their team, compressed our 
months-long process for developing store 
fixtures down to three weeks. And most of 
the work happened in just a few days:
• March 24, 2020: Store design 
associates sketched shield designs.
• March 25: A broad team of associates 
from store environment, store 
operations, merchandising, MET, 
technology, safety, procurement, 
logistics and project management met 
with five suppliers invited to create 
prototypes.
• March 26-30: Suppliers created 
sample shields with regular input from 
our Home Depot team, which was 
collecting feedback from associates 
testing shield prototypes at Store 
1777, a new store footprint, and Store 
106, a legacy-layout store that’s also 
in Kennesaw.
• March 31: Our team selected the final 
design.
• April 1: Manufacturing began.
New England Wire Products, based 
in Massachusetts, was chosen as the 
supplier because the company is a 
longtime Home Depot partner and had

2021 ESG Report     The Home Depotmetal fabrication capabilities, plexiglass 
sheets in stock and — importantly — no 
major COVID outbreaks in its facilities. 
While New England Wire manufactured 
the shield kits, Chad and his colleagues 
created step-by-step instructions and an 
accompanying video for associates who 
would do the assembly in stores. The 
instructions were straightforward, and 
the tips were simple. Don’t use power 
tools; use a crescent wrench and ratchet 
from the shelves. Expect to have a few 
pieces of leftover hardware. Have two 
associates available for some phases  
of assembly.  
Within three weeks, the kits were on 
their way from the factory to our stores. 
On April 25, they arrived at Store 4719 
in North Spokane, Washington. They 
got there late on a Saturday, just before 
closing time. MET members Caitlin Keon, 
Nate Brock and Brie Donahue were 
ready. They worked all night to construct 
36 shields at cash registers, specialty 
desks and customer service desks. 
Associates at the North Spokane store 
had a heightened awareness of COVID 
risks. Their state had been hit early 
and hard by a nursing home outbreak 
in February 2020 that killed dozens of 
people. Associates standing face-to-face 
with customers welcomed the shields.
“Our front-line associates were super 
thankful that we got the shields installed 
so quickly — before the store opened the 
next morning,” Caitlin says. “Assembly 
is in our MET wheelhouse. We pride 
ourselves on being able to pivot and be 
flexible to meet the needs of the store.”  
 
Head cashier Willie Morrow was glad 
to see the shields go in at Store 4719. 
He was managing through the anxiety 
front end associates were feeling. The 
shields were a morale boost because of 
their functionality — and their form. They 
looked “sleek and professional,” Willie 
says. “Associates on the front end were getting extra protection, and that was 
important.”
At Store 1777 in Kennesaw, Atley is 
grateful to stand behind the plexiglass 
protection her dad helped create. “The 
shields are still helping keep us safe 
and reminding us to be respectful of 
everyone’s space.” Atley says. “And, 
obviously, for me, there is a special 
level of pride.”
More than
75,000 shields  
were constructed from 
807,000+  square feet   
of plexiglass and about
1.45 million  
linear feet of tubing.“The shields are still 
helping keep us safe 
and reminding us to be 
respectful of everyone’s 
space. And, obviously, 
for me, there is a special 
level of pride.”
– Atley Thompson
Our COVID-19 plexiglass shield team compressed a months-long fixture development 
process to three weeks in March 2020 to get shields to stores — then paused for a 
celebratory photo at Store 106 in Kennesaw, Georgia.
>The Clamp’s a Champ
The secret weapon in our shield defense 
was a simple, versatile clamp. It can 
be locked into place on either side of a 
counter and adjusted to fit the wide variety 
of countertop depths in our legacy stores.At our peak in April 2020,
3,300+ shield kits    
were shipped to stores daily,  
and 95 stores  per day  
were installing shields.52

PROTECTING THE CLIMATE
STORE OPERATIONS
The Home Depot’s aim to use resources 
efficiently is driven by business demands. 
But we are proud that the effort we put into 
reducing our consumption of electricity and 
water also is good for the planet.  
 
Across our U.S. stores, we’ve cut electricity 
use 44% since 2010. We far surpassed 
our goal, set a few years ago, to reduce 
store kilowatt-hour electricity use 20% 
by 2020. This progress emerged from a 
diligent, business-centered focus to identify 
unnecessary electricity consumption and 
curb it. We did that by installing LED lighting, 
efficiency-driving building automation 
systems, updated air-conditioning and 
heating systems and more.  
 In 2020, our U.S. stores reduced 
electricity use by more than 14% year 
over year. We boosted our alternative 
and renewable energy capacity by more 
than 13%, compared to 2019. We also 
signed onto new off-site solar projects 
that will significantly increase our solar 
capacity by 2023.  
 
In addition, we increased our focus 
on saving water, implementing smart 
irrigation systems capable of reducing 
our irrigation-related consumption by 
approximately 30% at almost 450 U.S. 
stores. The following pages describe 
some of the ways we are making 
progress.Using resources wisely is 
a smart business strategy 
that also makes our 
store operations more 
sustainable.

ABOUT LEDS?
The benefits are similar in 
customers’ homes and our stores:
• Reduced electricity and lighting 
maintenance costs
• Lower electricity use that 
contributes to a smaller carbon 
footprint
• Brighter pathways that increase 
safety and improve aestheticsLED Transformation Shrinks  
Electricity Use
At the end of 2020, 1,589 of our U.S. 
stores had been upgraded to overhead 
LED lighting; LEDs were installed at 427 
stores in 2020 alone.  
 
Upgraded stores see electricity 
consumption drop by about 30%, 
on average, compared to using 
conventional lighting. Plus, the stores 
benefit from brighter aisles and better 
control over their technology-enhanced 
lights. For example, stores can 
selectively dim some areas of the store 
and leave others fully lit after hours, 
when associates are restocking but 
customers are not shopping.  
 
LEDs have been a big investment for our 
company, adding up to a $178 million 
total capital expenditure from 2018 to 
2020. But they’ve also been a big driver 
of the remarkable electricity savings we 
achieved in 2019 and 2020 (see chart). 
And the progress continues. We’re on 
track to install LEDs in all of our U.S. 
stores by the end of fiscal 2021.58

Home Depot stores.Building automation systems 
in all U.S. and Canadian 
stores monitor conditions, such 
as indoor temperature and

We’ve pledged to have 100% renewable 
electricity for all Home Depot facilities 
worldwide by 2030. It’s an expansion 
of our previous commitment to buy or 
produce 335 megawatts of renewable or 
alternative energy by 2025. Harnessing 
power from the sun will be crucial to our 
success; we anticipate about three-
quarters of our alternative and renewable 
energy capacity will come from solar by 
the end of 2023.  
 
We’ve announced plans to purchase 
solar power from three facilities, 
providing a collective 225 megawatts of 
renewable energy capacity, enough to 
power 450 stores.
• 75 megawatts  of solar energy 
generated by Enel Green Power in 
Haskell County, Texas, will come online 
in 2021.
• 100 megawatts  from a National Grid 
solar facility in Denton County, Texas, 
is scheduled to arrive in 2022.
• 50 megawatts from what will be one 
of the largest solar facilities in the U.S. 
— Invenergy’s complex of solar arrays 
stretching across three northeast Texas 
counties — will be available in 2023.
Furthermore, at the end of 2020, solar 
farms were operating atop 71 U.S. 
stores — up from 47 stores in 2019. We 
have another 46 rooftop solar projects in 
development in 2021.  
 Finally, our contracts with solar energy 
providers in Delaware, Massachusetts and 
Minnesota support the addition of new 
solar power to the grid in these areas.
Smart Irrigation Saves Water  
and Money
We conducted a pilot program across 
59 stores in 2019 and 2020 that showed 
us the potential impact of applying our 
detailed focus on conserving electricity 
to conserving water. The pilot stores saw 
their irrigation-related water use shrink by 
approximately 30%. So, in the fall of 2020, 
we installed smart irrigation water systems 
in another 384 U.S. stores.
The technology is sophisticated; each 
system is guided by information from 
in-ground sensors, real-time weather data 
and other sources. But the concept is 
simple. The system only sprays water on 
a store’s landscaped areas when plants 
need it. Smart irrigation works according to 
conditions, not the clock.  
 
We plan to roll out more of these water-
saving systems in 2021, aiming to have 
them at 500 stores by the end of the year.

CAREER EXPLORER
Associate Jordan Wallace’s Home Depot 
career path has covered a lot of ground. He 
started with our company nine years ago on 
the supply chain team. Then he moved to 
digital marketing. Now he’s a senior analyst 
in building services and deeply involved with 
our store evolution. His career path may 
surprise you, but it was a carefully crafted 
plan — one that shows how our investments 
in sustainability can help our associates 
and the environment, while advancing our 
business strategy.
A few years ago, Jordan was on the 
homedepot.com team when our CEO Craig 
Menear announced our company would be 
investing billions of dollars in stores. “I knew 
that would create opportunities,” Jordan 
says. So he started looking for operations 
jobs that interested him and aligned with his 
skill set. 
Building services needed someone to 
project-manage large initiatives. Jordan saw 
a fit. Today, he coordinates with lighting 
vendors, contractors, store leaders, local 
government officials and many others to get LEDs installed in our store ceilings. He 
draws on his understanding of logistics and 
technology, as well as his ability to pay close 
attention to even the smallest details. 
When our LED project was at its peak in 
2019, Jordan was coordinating installations 
for 30 stores a week. The overhaul was a 
big driver of our more than 14% drop in 
U.S. store electricity use in 2020. By the 
end of fiscal year 2021, all U.S. stores are 
expected to have interior lighting upgraded 
to LEDs.
Jordan believes any associate can chart a 
career as varied, interesting and rewarding 
as his. “If you have the willpower, you can 
make your own path,” he says. “The Home 
Depot has so many great opportunities. You 
shouldn’t limit yourself to just one.”

SUPPLY CHAIN
We’ve made significant progress on our One 
Supply Chain plan, announced in 2017, to 
invest $1.2 billion to fund about 150 new supply 
chain facilities nationwide.  
By the end of 2020, we had added over 30 
distribution centers, increasing speed to final 
destinations and reducing miles traveled for 
goods processed through these facilities.  
 
We kept moving forward on our One Supply 
Chain investments, even as we distributed more 
products than ever before. The Home Depot 
moved 1.2 billion cubic feet of products through 
our supply chain in 2020, a company record. 
Volume rose more than 20%, year over year.  
 
Even as supply chain volume increased, the 
efficiencies we gained in our operations and our 
investments in green energy helped us reduce 
our carbon intensity. Learn more on Page 54 .By making our supply 
chain more efficient, we 
reduce business costs 
and the impact that our 
product distribution has 
on the environment.
We sell available space on our 
trucks and buy space from 
other companies, ensuring 
fewer underloaded trailers hit 
the road. That space sharing 
saves about 2 million driven 
miles a year .By partnering with suppliers 
to forgo pallets, we can stack 
products to the top of trailers, 
resulting in as much as a 40% 
reduction in truck space  needed 
to transport some goods.

In 2020, we installed hydrogen 
fuel cells at nine U.S. supply

SOURCING RESPONSIBLY
ETHICAL SOURCING
We owe it to our customers, associates 
and communities to further the collective 
commitment to human rights, safety and 
environmentally sound practices through 
ethical sourcing. We engage our suppliers 
in this commitment by purchasing products 
made in factories that adhere to our 
responsible sourcing standards. We report 
on our progress in an annual Responsible 
Sourcing Report .
Our Responsible Sourcing Standards  
mandate that suppliers and factories abide 
by all applicable international and local laws, 
rules and regulations in the manufacturing 
and distribution of merchandise or services 
provided to us. We conduct audits around 
the world to ensure compliance with our 
responsible sourcing standards.
Suppliers must keep on-site documentation 
that demonstrates compliance with our 
responsible sourcing standards. They also 
must allow Home Depot associates and/
or representatives full access to production 
facilities, worker records, production records 
and workers for confidential interviews 
in connection with monitoring visits. We 
expect our suppliers to promptly correct 
any noncompliance, starting with timely 
preparation and presentation of a corrective 
and preventative action plan. We also re-
audit supplier facilities, with the frequency 
depending on their performance in prior audits.If suppliers fail to improve, we may terminate 
our business relationships with them. 
Equally important, we support factories 
that take action to create lasting social and 
environmental compliance programs. We 
encourage suppliers and factory workers 
to communicate concerns via processes 
outlined in our corporate Code of Conduct . 
Our responsible sourcing audits are 
designed to assess compliance in  
these areas:  
 
•     Laws and regulations
•     Child labor
•     Forced labor
•     Harassment and abuse
•     Compensation
•     Hours of work
•     Non-discrimination
•     Freedom of association and  
       collective bargaining
•     Health and safety
•     Environment
•     Subcontracting
•     Communication
•     Business ethics

Our company expects all suppliers that 
manufacture our products to provide 
appropriate information and conduct 
due diligence to enable our compliance 
with conflict minerals laws. We also 
expect these manufacturers to obtain 
products and materials from suppliers 
that are not involved in funding conflict 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(DRC) and adjoining covered countries. 
We partner with our private brands and 
proprietary product suppliers whose 
products contain tin, tungsten, tantalum 
or gold (referred to as 3TG) to identify 
the source of any of these minerals in the 
supply chain.
2020 Progress
As detailed in The Home Depot’s Conflict 
Minerals Report  for the year ended Dec. 
31, 2020, our efforts focused on collecting 
and disseminating information about the 
sourcing practices of our suppliers. We 
cataloged that information in a database 
using the conflict minerals reporting 
template developed by the Responsible 
Minerals Initiative® (formerly the Conflict-
Free Sourcing Initiative, or CFSI). We report 
this data for the calendar year, rather than 
our fiscal year, in line with U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission rules.
Our in-scope Tier 1 suppliers increased 
to 91 in 2020 from 71 in 2019. In 2020, 
as part of our annual assessment of 
products in scope, we continued to 
exclude any supplier of products where the 
supplier merely affixed company brands, 
trademarks, logos or labels to generic 
products manufactured by a third party, as 
permitted by SEC guidance.CONFLICT MINERALS  SOURCING RESPONSIBLY
Through our due-diligence process, 
which aligns with guidance from the 
Organisation for Economic Co-Operation 
and Development , we received 100% 
participation from our in-scope private 
brands and proprietary-product Tier 1 
suppliers.
Thirty-two percent of our in-scope  
Tier 1 suppliers indicated that one or more 
conflict minerals were necessary to the 
functionality or production of covered 
products, down from 44% in 2019. Of 
the smelters or refiners reported by these 
suppliers, only 49 out of a total of 304 
uniquely identified smelters or refiners 
sourced conflict minerals from covered 
countries. All of these smelters or refiners 
were certified as DRC conflict-free by the 
Responsible Minerals Initiative, the London 
Bullion Market Association and/or the 
Responsible Jewellery Council. However, 
a small number of suppliers below the Tier 
1 level were unable to complete chain-of-
custody surveys back to the level of the 
smelter or refiner.
We continue to work closely with our 
suppliers to ensure they implement 
responsible sourcing; obtain current, 
accurate and complete information 
about the supply chain; and encourage 
their smelters to obtain a “conflict-free” 
designation from an independent third-
party auditor.We work with our 
suppliers to ensure they 
implement responsible 
sourcing and encourage 
their smelters to 
obtain “conflict-free” 
designations.67

SUSTAINABLE FORESTRYSOURCING RESPONSIBLY
The Home Depot’s focus on selling products 
made from sustainable sources of wood 
dates to 1994, when certified-sustainable 
wood shelving first arrived in our aisles. 
We recognize the environmental impact 
our company can have on the world’s 
woodlands by working with suppliers 
that adhere to set standards of forest 
management and tree species selection. 
To help protect endangered forests and 
support efforts to preserve timber for 
future generations, we established a Wood 
Purchasing Policy  in 1999 and continue to 
update it.
We are proud of our ability to create positive 
change by encouraging sustainable forestry 
practices. We strive to better understand 
the social and economic effects that wood 
purchases have around the world, especially 
in regions with endangered forests.
 
Data-Driven Sourcing
Understanding the world’s forest coverage 
by country helps guide our supply chain 
decisions. The vast majority of our wood 
product purchases originate from North 
American forests, some of the most 
sustainable forests in the world.
Seventeen percent of the world’s forests are 
in Canada and the United States, according 
to research by the United Nations Food & 
Agriculture Organization. The U.N.’s 2020 
State of the World’s Forests  report shows 
that more than half of the world’s forest 
coverage is in five countries: Russia (20%), 
Brazil (12%), Canada (9%), the U.S. (8%) 
and China (5%). 
• Give preference to the purchase of 
wood and wood products originating 
from certified, well-managed forests 
wherever feasible.
• Eliminate the purchase of wood and 
wood products from forest regions 
identified as endangered.
• Practice and promote the efficient and 
responsible use of wood and wood 
products.
• Promote and support the development 
and use of alternative environmental 
products.
• Not accept wood products from the 
Amazon or Congo Basin areas, Papua 
New Guinea or the Solomon Islands, 
unless they’re Forest Stewardship 
Council (FSC)-certified.  
• Demand that our vendors and their 
suppliers of wood and wood products 
maintain compliance with laws and 
regulations pertaining to their operations 
and the products they manufacture.Our goal is to create 
transparency in how 
global forest resources 
are used in our products.The Home Depot’s Wood

Eco Options
The Home Depot’s Eco Options  program 
helps our customers identify products that 
have less of an impact on the environment 
and encourages our suppliers to provide 
more sustainable offerings.  
 
We launched Eco Options in 2007 in 
partnership with SCS Global Services, a 
leading, independent, third-party certification 
body that validates environmental claims. 
For a product to receive Eco Options 
classification, the supplier must document 
attributes that prove it has less of an impact 
on the environment than comparable 
products in the same category. Until all 
industries create and abide by a reporting 
formula that measures product attributes 
according to a common sustainability 
standard, we will continue to use our Eco 
Options program to help customers sort 
through green product claims.REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
GREENER PRODUCTS
Our greatest environmental 
impact comes from the

Focus on Forestry and  
Responsible Chemistry
In addition to our Eco Options and Eco 
Actions programs, we focus our sustainable 
product efforts in two key areas relevant to 
our business: forestry and indoor air quality. 
In 1999, we established a Wood Purchasing 
Policy  (see Page 68 ) to help avoid wood 
products coming from forestland with a 
high conservation value. And in 2017, we 
published our Chemical Strategy  (see Page 
78) to encourage the exclusion of certain 
chemicals from paint, flooring, insulation,

Our focus on circularity reflects our aim 
to prevent products and packaging from 
becoming trash. The foundation comes 
from nature: Nothing is wasted, and 
everything is regenerative.
We strive to offer products with a 
positive environmental impact, and we 
encourage suppliers to innovate in how 
they produce and package products for 
reuse and longevity. We carry more than 
2 million products, and many have the 
potential to move our economy toward 
circularity.
We also look for opportunities within 
Home Depot operations to reduce, 
repair, reuse and recycle. The goal is to 
extend our planet’s natural resources and 
protect land and water from the impact of 
material disposal.
Along with our suppliers and vendors, 
we are developing our thinking and 
capabilities in an effort to:
•   Design with the environment in mind
•   Eliminate excess materials
•   Eliminate materials that are not readily  
     reusable or recyclable
•   Minimize mixed materials to make

•   Use recycled content when possible

SQUEEZING NEW 
LIFE OUT OF WASTE
Associate Lindsey Tornello is curious. One 
day she saw a garbage truck leave a Home 
Depot facility with a full but lightweight 
load. What is it? she wondered. Lindsey, 
who manages our sustainability and 
recycling initiatives, followed the truck 
and watched it dump a pile of expanded 
polystyrene (EPS) foam into a landfill. She 
thought: There must be a better way.
She pitched the idea of using a 
compressing machine to shape leftover 
EPS packaging into blocks that could 
be repurposed for insulation and other 
products. Our company said yes, and a 
pilot program was born.
Here’s how it works. EPS foam is removed 
from packaging. The compressing machine 
squeezes it into blocks. The blocks are sold 
to companies that use it for insulation and 
other products and purposes. It’s a great 
example of our company’s commitment 
to circularity (see Page 74 ), as well as our 
orange-blooded ingenuity.“I appreciate the support I receive to think 
strategically and creatively. Having that 
support makes all the difference in my 
ability to make lasting, impactful change,” 
Lindsey says.
The pilot program sparked by curiosity 
kept about 89,000 pounds of EPS out 
of landfills in 2020. Now we’re expanding

The Home Depot encourages suppliers to 
make the products we sell more energy 
efficient, and our partnership with the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy 
Star® program supports those efforts, too. 
In 2020, we exceeded our stated multiyear 
goal to help our customers save $2.8 billion 
on utility bills through the purchase and 
proper use of energy-efficient products. 
Energy Star-labeled products were key 
to that progress. In 2020, we offered over 
23,000 energy-saving products in stores and 
online, including more than 8,000 Energy Star 
products. We sold more than 159 million units 
of Energy Star products.
We estimate our customers’ purchases of 
Energy Star products in 2020 helped reduce 
annual electricity use by 7.5 billion kilowatt 
hours, saving over $1 billion on energy costs 
and lowering carbon emissions by over 
5 million metric tons. That’s equivalent to 
removing over 1.1 million cars from the road.REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

million units of those WaterSense products. 
We estimate our customers’ purchases of 
WaterSense products in 2020 helped reduce 
annual water consumption by over 60 billion 
gallons, which would collectively mean 
savings of more than $726 million on water 
bills.
Every drop of water counts, and we do our 
part to help ensure it’s used economically. 
For example, all showerheads sold in our 
U.S. stores have a maximum flow of 1.8 
gallons per minute, which exceeds the 
WaterSense standard.

Solar energy is the most abundant energy 
resource on earth, and, after solar panel 
installation, it has zero environmental 
impact. That makes it one of the cleanest 
and most sustainable sources of power. 
By partnering with Sunrun, The Home 
Depot makes it easier for our customers 
to generate clean energy at home.
The solar energy system from our supplier 
is able to send excess power from 
customers’ homes back to the electric 
grid. That enables the whole community 
to benefit from clean power from the sun. 
Some utilities even offer solar credits to 
customers, essentially buying the extra 
solar power their homes produce.
In 2020, our solar program completed 
installations at over 4,500 homes, giving 
our customers the capacity to produce 
nearly 34,000 kilowatts of solar energy.REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
RESIDENTIAL SOLAR
Our solar partners have 
installed systems that 
generated more than 
330,000 kilowatts of 
clean energy for our 
customers since 2016.Nationwide and across all solar suppliers, 
residential solar deployment in 2020 fell 
below the 18% annual growth reported in 
2019 because residential installations were 
significantly slowed by the pandemic in the 
first half of 2020. But by the end of the year, 
installations of residential and commercial 
solar systems were expanding rapidly. Solar 
accounted for 43% of all new electricity-
generating capacity in the U.S. in 2020, 
according to the Solar Energy Industries 
Association (SEIA).

The Home Depot’s packaging team works 
with our private-label product suppliers to 
apply science to creating better packages. 
Our goals are to reduce package footprints 
and use more sustainable materials to 
secure and protect the private-label 
products we sell. From 2017 through 2020, 
our packaging innovations allowed us to:  
• Redesign 366 packages  to reduce size 
and materials
• Avoid sending over 3,800 cargo  
containers  on the high seas  
Using Less EPS & PVC
In 2020, our packaging team continued to 
find substitutes for expanded polystyrene 
(EPS) foam and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film 
in our private-label products. EPS foam is 
good at protecting products from damage, 
but it contains beads of chemicals and oil 
that are often difficult to recycle and can 
take more than a century to biodegrade. 
So, we’re scouting out even small amounts 
and replacing EPS with easier-to-recycle 
materials like molded pulp and paper.REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
SUSTAINABLE  
PACKAGING
Our packaging 
innovations reduce 
waste, increase shipping 
efficiency and decrease 
product damage. That’s 
good for the planet and 
our business.PVC film is a thin, rigid synthetic plastic 
polymer that’s molded around products to 
secure and protect them. But, like EPS, it 
is tough to recycle and takes a long time 
to break down naturally, and we’re working

RETHINKING WHAT’S  
INSIDE THE BOX
In 2020, our ongoing effort to find more sustainable substitutes for expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam led our packaging 
innovation team to the ceiling fan aisle. Fan blades and electronic parts for years have been packed in EPS. But the foam 
takes up a lot of space, and it takes a long time to biodegrade. So, we made a big change to smaller, greener packages for 
our private-label fans. Here’s how we did it.
Molded paper pulp  
protects as well as EPS 
but uses less space and 
biodegrades faster
126 fan models  
were repackaged 
with molded paper
On average, using molded 
pulp instead of EPS can  
shrink package size 15%Smaller packages 
decrease demand for 
space  on cargo ships 
and trucks, helping 
reduce emissions94

THE HOME DEPOT
FOUNDATION
The Foundation works 
to improve the homes 
and lives of U.S. 
veterans, train skilled 
tradespeople to fill the 
labor gap and support 
communities affected by 
natural disasters. Support for Veterans
Giving back to veterans is personal at The 
Home Depot. Many of our associates are 
affiliated with the U.S. military, either as 
active-duty members, military spouses 
or veterans, and we’ve worked to build 
programs to support those associates (see 
Page 41 ).
The Home Depot Foundation  has 
committed $500 million to veteran causes 
by 2025. At the end of 2020, over $350 
million of that pledge had been invested. 
The Foundation, in collaboration with Team 
Depot and nonprofit partners, has helped to 
improve more than 48,000 veteran homes 
and facilities since 2011.  
 
From Veterans Day through the holiday 
season, The Home Depot Foundation puts 
good into action through our Operation 
Surprise campaign. In 2020, Operation 
Surprise:
• Celebrated the service of veterans, first 
responders, health care workers and 
teachers
• Provided additional cash grants to 
nonprofits serving our communities to 
help them meet increased demand during 
the pandemic
• Addressed unique housing challenges 
many veterans faced in 2020 by providing 
a month of mortgage or rental payment 
for 500 veterans
Throughout 2020, the Foundation’s  
traditional support for improving the lives  
and homes of veterans stayed constant,  
and we celebrated progress. For example,  
we marked the completion of a multiyear 
project with nonprofit partner Tunnel 
to Towers Foundation  that allowed 
disabled veteran Brandon Adam to regain 
independence at home.  Disaster Response
In 2020, The Home Depot Foundation 
committed more than $4 million to assist 
communities affected by fires, tornadoes 
and hurricanes. The Foundation also 
applied our disaster response experience 
and funding to assisting nonprofit partners 
with COVID-19 relief, including assistance 
for food insecurity and COVID-19 testing.

TEAM DEPOT
Together with The Home 
Depot Foundation, 
Team Depot improves 
the homes and lives 
of veterans and helps 
communities affected by 
natural disasters.Our powerful associate volunteer 
force pivoted in 2020 to safely support 
communities in need during the pandemic. 
With our regular Team Depot  projects 
on hiatus, associates organized socially 
distanced disaster kit assembly lines, 
curbside donation queues and other 
COVID-aware ways to keep giving back. 
We assisted communities with some of the 
tough challenges of 2020, for example by 
assembling meal kits for hunger relief and 
donating products to essential workers.
Many of the communities we serve felt the 
impact of COVID-19 and natural disasters. 
In April 2020, a series of tornadoes swept 
the Southeast. Associates organized 6-feet-
apart assembly lines and filled Homer 
buckets with much-needed supplies, 
including water, work gloves, sanitization 
products, flashlights and more.
The same assembly system that worked 
for spring tornadoes allowed us to do our 
part during an extreme Atlantic hurricane 
season that brought 30 named storms, the 
most on record. In July, Hurricane Hanna 
made landfall in Corpus Christi, Texas, 
generating strong winds and heavy rainfall 
that caused damage, flooding and power 
outages in communities across the Rio 
Grande Valley. Associate volunteers formed 
socially distanced assembly lines and filled 
400 buckets to help people in need in the 
community.After Category 4 Hurricane Laura 
made landfall in southwest Louisiana in 
September, associates came together — 
while keeping their distance — to assemble 
more than 1,000 disaster relief kits and help 
turn a Home Depot parking lot into a pop-
up meal distribution center. (Learn more on 
Page 108 .)
While the pandemic limited certain 
elements of volunteerism, our associates’ 
commitment to serving communities was 
unwavering. In establishing new strategies 
for safe volunteerism, Team Depot 
facilitated more than 3,200 grants to help 
our communities in 2020: a 100% increase 
year over year.
Some of these grants were distributed 
during The Home Depot’s annual Operation 
Surprise service campaign. In November 
and December, nearly 2,500 Foundation-
funded grants totaling more than $3 million 
were delivered by Team Depot to nonprofits 
nationwide. We also thanked veterans, first 
responders, health care workers, teachers 
and nonprofit organizations for their service 
with surprise gifts delivered at a distance.

PUTTING GOOD  
INTO ACTION
Louisiana native Tracy Jefferson knows a thing 
or two about hurricanes. And what it takes to 
recover from them.
“I’m born and raised in New Orleans. I know 
the area,” she says. So, Tracy — a Team Depot 
district community captain and manager of 
our Harahan, Louisiana, store — was quick 
to rally our associate volunteer force to help 
communities pummeled by Hurricane Laura.
After the Category 4 storm made landfall in 
September 2020, Tracy and other associates 
traveled 200 miles across south Louisiana to 
Lake Charles, where thousands of people were 
left without power — or easy access to food.
Our volunteers got to work in the parking lot 
of a Lake Charles Home Depot store that had 
converted its parking lot to a pop-up meal 
distribution center. In partnership with World 
Central Kitchen, and backed by funds from 
The Home Depot Foundation, our orange-
blooded associates helped serve more than 
1,000 meals to people whose homes and lives 
had been upended by the hurricane.That was only one of the ways Tracy and her 
fellow associates gave back in 2020. They 
also helped local community centers with 
COVID-19 response, assembled disaster 
relief kits, organized merchandise donations

“Really what inspires me to do all the work

them to see that I make time for all needs

me. It’s about the people who help me get 
this done.
“I love what I do. I love working with my

As hospitals and first responders struggled to get crucial supplies, a small, cross-functional Home Depot team 
orchestrated the donation of personal protective equipment to health care workers battling COVID-19.MASK MISSIONSPOTLIGHT
n March 2020, The Home Depot 
accepted a mission to get 
in-demand N95 masks to front-
line health care workers across 
the United States. We ultimately donated 3.4 
million masks to more than 250 hospitals 
and health care facilities, drawing on our 
associates’ ingenuity, expertise, strong 
relationships and orange-blooded sheer will 
to make something that seems impossible 
actually happen.
Here’s how it began. In mid-March 2020, as 
the COVID-19 coronavirus began sweeping 
the globe and overwhelming hospitals, our 
company started prioritizing mask sales to 
health care facilities. Then, a few days later, 
we ceased selling N95 masks and started 
donating them to help protect front-line 
nurses, doctors and first responders from 
the virus.
That decision was important, bold and 
complex. It was up to Jim Core, general 
manager of Pro Institutional, to bring 
together a Home Depot team that could 
overcome the challenges. When Jim — who 
is based in Charlotte, North Carolina — got 
the assignment, he knew whom to call first.
He phoned Monica Green-Jackson in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma. Monica, who manages 
Pro Institutional sales support, is an 
organizational wonder and a wizard with 
a spreadsheet. She’s also been with The 
Home Depot for over 30 years, and Jim was 
certain her company knowledge and rapport 
with co-workers would be invaluable as the 
team streamlined logistics around mask 
procurement and distribution.
Community resource during COVID
Next, Jim reached out to Sarah McDonald, 
who helps manage relationships with 
elected officials in Washington, D.C., and 
in state and local governments across the 
U.S. Sarah and others on our government I
relations team (see Page 126 ) were 
working with The Home Depot Foundation 
to field PPE requests from officials, 
businesspeople and community leaders 
around the country. They already had 
identified opportunities to donate more 
than a million masks to hospitals and 
first responders. “Local officials saw us 
as a community resource during COVID, 
just like we are during natural disasters,” 
Sarah says.
Sarah suggested Heather Tenney bring 
her supply chain channel management 
expertise to the team. Heather recruited 
George Schultz, a global sourcing team 
product development merchant who 
has strong relationships with overseas 
suppliers that make N95 masks. Both 
Heather and George are based in Atlanta.
The quintet, supported by dozens of 
associates across the company, did a lot 
of improvisation and some reinvention. 
On April 2, 2020, the head of 
nursing at Whittier Hospital 
Medical Center in Whittier, 
California, reached out to The 
Home Depot for help with 
PPE. Eleven days later, 10,000 
donated N95 masks arrived.
DID YOU KNOW
In 2020, we contributed 
over $50 million in funds 
and supplies to support 
community needs during 
COVID-19.

2021 ESG Report     The Home Depot
Requests for masks were coming in from 
everywhere. Stores were hearing from 
local hospitals. Veterans hospitals and 
health care-related nonprofits were asking 
the Foundation for help. Sarah and her 
government relations co-workers’ phones 
were ringing nonstop. At one point, Jim 
was receiving an email every five minutes 
from someone asking for masks.
Leveraging relationships and scale
Monica recorded all of the requests, and 
the team used prioritization software 
customized by our IT team to rank 
orders by urgency. COVID hot spots got 
the most attention. The mask donation 
team leveraged strong relationships 
with suppliers and the power and scale 
of The Home Depot to keep masks 
flowing to health care workers. By the 
time our company resumed limited sales 
of masks to health care facilities and 
select Pro customers in May 2020, we 
had donated millions of N95 masks 
nationwide.
“It was a lot of work, but it didn’t seem 
like work,” Jim recalls. “Protecting our 
health care workers and first responders 
was paramount. In some small way we 
were helping save lives.”
What Jim, Monica, Sarah, Heather and 
George were able to do together has 
fundamentally changed Jim’s outlook 
on work. “I know we can execute with 
greater speed and transparency. I 
better understand the power of cross-
functional collaboration to get things 
done,” he says. “It’s inspiring.” 3.4 million donated nearly
N95 masks to help  
front-line health care 
workers nationwideOur company“HAVING SUFFICIENT PPE IS CRITICAL TO KEEPING 
OREGON’S FRONT-LINE WORKERS SAFE AND 
HEALTHY. THANK YOU, HOME DEPOT.”

2021 ESG Report     The Home DepotBoard Committees
Our Board of Directors has established four standing committees, each comprised solely of independent directors and 
governed by a written charter that sets forth its purpose, composition, powers, duties and responsibilities.
Board Oversight of Risk
The company has a robust framework designed to identify and ensure proper management of risk, including risk relating 
to our ability to operate responsibly and sustainably. The framework that we use to identify and manage risk considers a 
number of enterprise-level issues, including competitive environment, brand and reputation, regulatory and compliance, and 
security. The framework also considers external and internal factors that could distract from or derail strategic objectives. The 
Board oversees risk through this framework, with oversight accomplished by identifying key risks and mapping them to the 
appropriate Board committee or to the full Board. 
Our Board reviews these key risks and the related framework annually, and the full Board or appropriate Board committees 
discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year, including the COVID-19 pandemic, its related risks and its impact on 
our enterprise risk framework. The table below identifies key risk areas overseen by the Board and its committees.BOARD OF DIRECTORS

We actively participate, and encourage our 
associates to participate, in the political 
process. Our Political Activity and 
Government Relations Policy  provides 
the framework for our political activity. We 
engage in three key ways:
• Our Government Relations department 
protects and expands our company’s 
ability to take care of our associates, 
customers and shareholders through 
effective regulatory and legislative 
action. Our Government Relations team 
works to optimize the government’s 
impact on the business through 
effective lobbying, relationship building 
and political engagement.
• We have a political action committee 
(PAC) that connects our salaried 
associates to the political process 
and pools their personal contributions 
to financially support pro-business 
candidates who understand issues of 
importance to The Home Depot and our 
associates. As a long-standing practice, 
we do not contribute to presidential 
campaigns or endorse presidential 
candidates.GOVERNMENT  
RELATIONS
The Home Depot 
recognizes that laws at 
the federal, state and 
local level impact our 
business. • The Home Depot supports trade 
associations that advocate on behalf of 
the business community and retail sector 
and reports annually the aggregate dues 
paid to those associations that engage in 
lobbying activities.
In deciding where we want to focus our 
advocacy, these are some of our top priorities:
• Driving sales by ensuring online-only 
marketplaces follow the same rules 
on accountability and transparency as 
interconnected retailers
• Supporting our One Supply Chain initiative 
by advocating for funding for roads, ports 
and bridges and for laws that allow safer, 
heavier trucks to reduce loads and our 
environmental footprint
• Protecting margins by working to get 
laws passed that target sophisticated, 
organized retail crime rings to reduce theft 
and support free trade
• Taking care of our people by making sure 
we have a say in laws that could affect 
associate flexibility and career growth

Oversight of Our Political Activity
Our Government Relations department, led 
by a vice president who reports to our general 
counsel, manages our political activity. The 
team carefully analyzes our engagement 
activities, trade association partnerships 
and political contributions, keeping in mind 
our key priorities and our core values. All of 
The Home Depot’s political contributions are 
made to promote the interests of the company 
and without regard for the private political 
preferences of executives or directors. The 
Government Relations team is responsible 
for ensuring all PAC and corporate political 
contributions are made in accordance with 
the law and company policies. The team 
participates in regular trainings and performs 
routine reviews to monitor compliance.  
 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee  of our Board of Directors 
provides additional oversight, conducting 
an annual review of our Political Activity and 
Government Relations Policy, the company’s 
political contributions and payments to trade 
associations that engage in lobbying activities.  
 
The Nominating & Corporate Governance 
Committee must approve in advance any 
public advertisement directly or indirectly paid 
for by the Company that expressly advocates 
the election or defeat of a candidate in which 
Home Depot is identified specifically as an 
advocate of such election or defeat. To date, 
the company has not made any expenditure 
for such electioneering communications, 
and has no present plans to make any such 
expenditures.  
 
The Home Depot PAC’s finances, governance 
and communications are governed by a 
PAC Board. The PAC Board is chaired by 
the vice president of Government Relations 
and is made up of representatives from each 
functional area of the business and each field 
division to ensure a wide range of experiences 
and perspectives.   
 
We provide transparency in our actions by 
publishing annual reports of the company’s 
political contributions  and the aggregate 
dues paid to trade associations  that engage 
in lobbying activities. We list trade associations 
to which our company makes yearly payments 
of $5,000 or more, and our PAC contributions 
are publicly available on the Federal Election 
Commission  website.PATH OF THE PAC DOLLAR
Our political action committee connects salaried 
associates to the political process and pools their personal 
contributions to financially support pro-business candidates

Our Core Values drive all strategic decisions inside 
our company, and we build relationships with elected 
officials who help enable our ability to implement 
those strategies to the benefit of our associates, 
customers, shareholders and communities. Here 
are the primary, business-focused criteria the PAC 
considers when deciding which candidates to support:
• Service on key committees important to  
The Home Depot 
• Favorable position on one or more legislative 
issues that align with The Home Depot’s business 
objectives
• Service in a current or potential leadership position
• Location of a Home Depot facility in the 
candidate’s district
• Industry support from business and retail 
organizationsQUALITY ASSURANCE

CORPORATE TAXES
Taxes are a significant component of The 
Home Depot’s economic contribution to 
the countries, states and local communities 
in which we operate. Our commitment to 
our core values informs how we approach 
taxes. Responsible management of The 
Home Depot’s taxes includes:
Accountability & Governance
Tax governance is overseen by the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors. At 
least once a year, company leaders report 
to the Audit Committee regarding our 
approach to managing taxes. Learn more 
about our Corporate Governance structure 
on Page 124 .
Risk Management
We identify and manage risks associated 
with taxes, including:
• Legislative uncertainty
• Reputational risk, including that a tax 
position taken by the company may not 
be consistent with our guiding principles 
or may expose the company to negative 
publicity
• Scarcity of talented tax professionals to 
recruit and hire as associates
Compliance
We comply with tax laws in the jurisdictions 
in which we operate, including reporting 
and paying our taxes in a timely manner by:
• Employing appropriate resources and 
controls to ensure that our tax reporting 
is accurate and complete
• Supporting audits of our tax reporting 
and control environment by our internal 
control team and independent, third-
party auditors, as required for publicly 
traded companiesWe do the right thing 
for our associates, 
shareholders and 
communities by ensuring 
we pay our fair share of 
taxes and manage them 
transparently.• Seeking reasonable interpretations of 
laws where there may be ambiguity
• Engaging proactively and transparently 
with tax authorities, when appropriate, to 
seek clarity, guidance or agreement on 
tax positions
Alignment with Our Business
Our corporate entity structure reflects the 
alignment with our commercial activities 
to ensure that we pay our fair share of 
tax commensurate with our business’ 
geographical footprint and operations within 
a jurisdiction. Additionally, we seek and 
claim tax incentives that:
• Align with our business
• Are consistent with the statutory or 
regulatory framework
• Drive economic development and job 
creation in the communities in which  
we operate
Stakeholder Engagement
We actively engage with federal, state and 
local governments; tax authorities; trade 
associations; and other business groups 
to advocate for policies that align with our 
approach to tax management, including the 
ways we:
• Support tax policies that drive a vibrant, 
competitive and growing economy
• Staff our stores based upon revenue 
generated within the stores; thus, a 
strong economy that includes balanced 
taxation policy drives revenue that 
supports employment129
