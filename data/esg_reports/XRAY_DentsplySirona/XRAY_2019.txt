38ӏConclusionDear Reader,
As a true global player and the 
largest manufacturer of professional 
dental products and technologies, 
we take Corporate Social Responsi -
bility (CSR) seriously. Everyone at  
Dentsply Sirona shares a common 
Vision: to improve oral healthcare 
around the world. Our CSR platform  
therefore includes a core focus 
through corporate philanthropy on 
initiatives that aim to improve oral 
healthcare.  
 
We measure our success not only by 
how much value we can create for 
our shareholders and customers  
but also by the positive impact we  
make on local and global commu-  
nities. Growth and success come 
with additional responsibility. That’s 
why, as we have grown significantly 
in the rapidly developing regions of 
Asia, Latin America and the Middle 
East, we are taking steps to reduce 
our environmental footprint by 
increasing efficiency and further 
improving our processes. Every day, we empower dental profes-  
sionals all over the world to provide mil -
lions of patients with better dental care 
and make people smile. At the heart of our  
business are innovative products and  
integrated solutions for dental profes-  
sionals that make a difference in the lives 
of their patients. As a global leader in the 
dental industry, we constantly strive to  
exceed expectations – of our customers, 
our employees, our shareholders and the 
communities in which we live and work. 02
Our Company and its employees 
work together to deliver meaningful 
innovation to meet the constantly 
evolving needs of our customers. We 
spend over $150 million annually to 
advance dentistry, and have the  
largest research and development 
platform in the industry with over 
600 R&D professionals in our work -
force. We also make clinical educa -
tion a priority. Last year, our clinical 
education programs reached over 
470,000 people from 97 countries.  
 
Our employees’ passion for  
innovation fosters our Company’s 
culture and brings out the best  
in our people. We see our employees 
as our most valuable asset. Their 
health, safety and development  
are a priority and critically  
important to our future success.  
We make their voices heard, as  
each individual contribution is  
vital to shaping the future of  
our Company and better serving  
our customers. Dentsply Sirona’s executive team 
continues to look for new ways to 
strengthen our CSR initiatives and 
build even greater trust among all 
of our stakeholders. The 2019 CSR 
Report shares an overview of how 
Dentsply Sirona and its employees 
are working together to make a  
difference: by giving back to  
communities, supporting local  
initiatives and working to improve 
oral health globally. 
 
 
Respectfully yours,

Responsibility
Platform
Dentsply Sirona’s Vision is to 
improve oral health worldwide. 
Therefore, a key component of the 
Company’s CSR platform focuses 
on initiatives aimed at moving that 
vision forward, whether through 
improving access to dental care, 
delivering innovative solutions or 
providing oral health education. This 
is consistent with the Purpose and 
Mission of the Company to empow -
er dental professionals all over the 
world to provide millions of patients 
with better dental care and make 
people smile. Improving oral health 
can have a profound and positive 
effect on a person’s confidence, 
overall health and economic oppor -
tunity.
Dentsply Sirona works with many 
organizations and initiatives at local, 
national, and international levels, 
helping to provide and improve oral 
healthcare by donating expertise 
and resources. For instance, the 
Company’s ongoing partnership 
with the America’s Dentists Care 
Foundation supports its mission to 
facilitate charitable dental clinics As an international company with offices and production facilities 
around the world, Dentsply Sirona’s footprint is truly global. The  
Company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) platform reflects  
its responsibility to be a good corporate citizen and a partner in  
improving the overall wellbeing of the global community. 
across the U.S. by providing  
donated products for treatment.  
Dentsply Sirona has a strong  
tradition of supporting dental  
missions to communities lacking  
access to basic dental care across 
the globe, recently in remote  
locations of the Amazon Rainforest,  
Jamaica, the Philippines and  
Uganda.
In addition to sponsoring oral health 
initiatives, Dentsply Sirona also 
supports research and education. 
Whether through its long-standing 
partnership with the Student  
Competition for Advancing Dental  
Research and its Application  
(SCADA) or through the Dentsply 
Sirona Academy, the Company is 
commited to the future of research 
and education in the dental industry. 
Beyond donating resources to  
causes that align with the  
Company’s purpose, the CSR  
platform also highlights the  
Company’s commitment to the 
development, health and wellbeing 
of its employees and the commu -
06
nities in which they live and work. 
Dentsply Sirona’s CSR platform also 
addresses the topics of gover-  
nance, including the Company’s 
Code of Business Conduct and Eth -
ics, as well as a statement regarding 
its approach to political spending.  
 
Dentsply Sirona continues to work 
toward reducing its environmental 
footprint at all manufacturing sites 
and offices, and a description of 
those efforts is also included in this 
report.
When it comes to oral care, at some 
point, everyone is a patient. This is 
a reminder that as an organization 
and an industry leader, Dentsply 
Sirona has a responsibility to set 
the standard for delivering the best 
quality products and services that 
ultimately benefit patients. The 2019 
Corporate Social Responsibility  
platform showcases Dentsply  
Sirona’s commitment to putting 
people at the center of everything it 
does. The Management Committee 
and Board of Directors firmly  
support and endorse this platform.07

healthcare around the world. This commitment is codified in the Company’s Vision, 
Purpose and Mission. In the spirit of this aspiration, Dentsply Sirona and its employees 
support and participate in dental missions in parts of the world where access to high 
quality, modern dentistry is limited. The Company also supports projects and  
initiatives that improve the oral healthcare infrastructure in a number of countries  
and regions while also engaging with programs that focus on disease prevention  
and education. Clinical education and training also play a major role in achieving the 
goal of improving oral healthcare by empowering dental professionals to stay current 
on cutting edge solutions and techniques. Dentsply Sirona has a long history of  
supporting research and education for the next generation of dental professionals.  
For 2019, Dentsply Sirona was involved in over twenty projects around the world.08
Dental care in the Amazon Rain-  
forest region of Brazil  
 
The Amazonia Project brings dental 
care to indigenous communities 
in areas of Brazil where access 
to modern dentistry is difficult or 
limited. For the indigenous people 
of the Amazon Rainforest, gaining 
access to state-of-the-art dental 
treatment is helpful. Many cannot 
afford dental care and generally do 
not have access to a dentist.  
 
The project is an initiative of  
Dr. Caio Eduardo Machado, a dentist 
from São Paulo, in cooperation with 
Doutores Sem Fronteiras (Doctors 
Without Borders). Dentsply Sirona has been a long-time supporter of 
the project and, in 2019, two expedi -
tions took place, reaching commu -
nities in the states of Mato Grosso 
and Rondônia. Heavy rains created 
challenges for the healthcare team 
in the former Xingu region expe -dition, which needed to transport 
its equipment into the jungle for 
several hours on small boats. With 
help from the local residents, a 
total of five mobile clinics were set 
up to treat patients with modern 
technology and equipment, includ -
ing intraoral scanners and milling 
machines powered by generators. 
Dentsply Sirona supported the team 
of seven dentists, providing CEREC 
units as well as dental instruments 
and materials to treat a range of 
oral healthcare issues and even 
create dental prostheses. With 
its renewed commitment in the 
Amazon, Dentsply Sirona reinforces 
its readiness to make a sustained 
contribution to improving the oral 1

Dental treatment for children in 
Guatemala  
 
According to the World Bank, rates 
of poverty and inequality in Gua -
temala are high, and indigenous 
peoples remain particularly dis-  
advantaged. Project Somos works 
to improve the disparity by edu -
cating children and families about 
the importance of nutrition, overall 
hygiene as well as dental hygiene in 
the Tecpán area of Guatemala. Over 
90 percent of Tecpán’s inhabitants 
are indigenous. The project is run by 
the Compassion Fruit Society, which Building smiles in Uganda  
 
The Build Your Smile Dental  
Foundation, based in Canada,  
organizes dental missions to im -
prove the oral health of communities 
in Uganda. Dentsply Sirona Canada 
is proud of its ongoing support of 
the foundation, helping it to utilize 
the latest dental and laboratory 
technology in challenging settings. 
A recent mission resulted in 1,022 
tooth extractions, 2,300 fluoride  
treatments, and the delivery of 90 
dentures. The team placed over 
100 restorations and performed 130 
preventive scaling treatments. They 
were even able to perform five bone 
graft surgeries and seven patients 
received dental implants.  
 
Beyond the physical dental work, 
the foundation also trains local 
dental practitioners to work at their 
standard of care. Build Your Smile’s 
valuable volunteer work continues 
to substantially improve lives of 
those they treat in Uganda, who 
would otherwise face adversity due 
to not having teeth.  
 
Transforming treatment in Kenya  
 
Dentaid supports dentists around 
the world by providing equipment, 
running oral health programs and 
sending teams of volunteer dental 
professionals. In rural Kenya the 
need for these projects is high, as 
the dentist to population ratio is 
1:40,000, while the World Health 
Organization recommends a ratio  
of 1:7,500.  
 
Dentsply Sirona supported  
Dentaid in 2019 with the donation  
of a portable Cavitron Select 
ultrasonic scaler, which made a 
significant difference by completely 
transforming the amount of work 
the team was able to do. In 2019,  
the mission completed 322 scaling 
treatments.is a Canadian charity. In indigenous 
communities near where Project So -
mos works, preventive dental care is 
not something most can afford.  
 
Therefore, in 2019, Dentsply Sirona  
sponsored two days of dental 
treatment, held at the Maxillofacial 
Centre in Antigua, Guatemala, for 
40 children aged 3 to 8. For most 
of the children, this was their first 
visit to a dentist. All of the patients 
received a panoramic X-ray or OPT, 
and a clinical examination to deter -
mine the rate of decayed, missing or 
filled teeth. Some children received 
root canal treatment while most  
of them were treated for cavities  
with fillings and some received  
fluoride applications.A patient

Dental care for a children’s home 
in China  
 
Jiangxi Sun Village is one of 10 Sun 
Villages in China, operating as a 
non-government charity organiza -
tion. For over a decade, the organi -
zation has worked with the children 
of prisoners. Currently, over 300 
children are living at the Jiangxi 
Sun Village.  
 
Dentsply Sirona China invited 
seven volunteers to provide dental 
treatment to the children from No -
vember 8-10, 2019. On the first day, 
volunteers conducted basic dental 
examinations for 137 children in Sun 
Village and created a dental health 
file for each child to make follow-up 
care easier in the future. Of the 
group that received dental exams, 
34 children with serious conditions 
received further treatment at a cli-
nic where Dentsply Sirona provided 
CEREC technology to help.TeamSmile promotes children’s  
oral health  
 
Since 2007, TeamSmile has facilitat -
ed partnerships among dental pro -
fessionals, professional sports teams 
and dental organizations to provide 
dental treatment for children who 
would lack access to quality oral 
healthcare and education in their 
communities. TeamSmile organizes 
events throughout the United States 
and, in 2019, their goal was to reach 
6,000-7,000 children. Dentsply 
Sirona began supporting TeamSmile 
in 2017 at a local Charlotte, NC event 
and then expanded its support to 
become a national partner.  
 
In 2019, Dentsply Sirona employees 
volunteered at two events – one in 
Charlotte in March and the other in 
Tampa, FL in July. During the Char -
lotte TeamSmile program, more than 
200 children received free dental 
services, ranging from extractions 
to sealants. Employees volunteered 
to help and Dentsply Sirona also 
donated five units of its ultrasonic 
scaling system, Nupro Freedom, in -
cluding foot pedals. Dentsply Sirona 
also made a financial donation and participated in Charlotte’s annual 
charity golf tournament that raised 
money for the TeamSmile program 
with the Carolina Panthers football 
team.  
 
At the Tampa event, which took 
place at the Tampa Bay Rays Stadi -
um, 275 children were successfully 
treated. Local Dentsply Sirona sales 
associates volunteered their time 
interacting with the children and 
helping to ensure a positive and 
stress-free experience during their 
dental treatments. They also accom -
panied the children to the fun activ -
ities which included a pizza lunch, 
playing baseball with trainers from 
the Tampa Bay Rays, face painting, 
balloons, running around the base -
ball field, or dancing to the music 
provided by an entertaining DJ.
Dental mission to Fiji  
 
Dentsply Sirona supported an  
Australian dental team led by  
Dr. Ram Nathwani, who volunteers 
with the Sai Organisation, for the 
annual Fijian medical camp Sai 
MediCare. Dentsply Sirona supplied

the four-day medical camp in Au -
gust, 324 patients were served at 
two clinics on a northern island of 
Fiji, including 189 dental restorations. 
The surgical team performed seven 
oral operations for patients who 
may have otherwise been required 
to go to the main island of Fiji or 
overseas to be treated. The surgical 
team also spent time with local  
surgical and anesthetics registrars 
to train them for these procedures. 
The Sai MediCare project continues 
to assist hundreds of less fortunate 
people in rural Fiji.
Dental care through U.S. Mission of 
Mercy events  
 
The non-profit organization, Mission  
of Mercy (MOM), has been providing 
healthcare to those in need since 
1994 in locations around the U.S. Raising money for the  
Charlotte community’s oral  
healthcare needs  
 
Dentsply Sirona also supported 
Mission of Mercy in North Carolina, 
where over a million people lack  
medical or dental insurance.  
Dentsply Sirona was a lead sponsor 
for the Charlotte-based non-profit 
organization, A Night for Smiles, on  
September 14, 2019, when a Black  
Tie Gala was held to benefit the 
Charlotte Chapter of the Kenneth 
D. Owen North Carolina Missions of 
Mercy (NCMOM). The NCMOM is a 
group of dentists, dental hygienists, 
dental assistants, as well as many 
volunteers, who donate their time 
and talents through clinics. Dona -
tions from the gala event helped 
to support a two-day dental clinic 
event for adults that took place  
October 18-19 at the Bojangles Arena 
in Charlotte. Approximately 1,500 
adults received dental treatment.Dentsply Sirona and its employees 
have proudly supported a number of 
the organization’s dental events. Each 
year, the Arizona MOM program pro -
vides approximately $2 million of free 
dentistry to roughly 2,000 patients 
who have financial barriers to access -
ing care. Over the course of two days 
in December of 2019, 200 dentists 
and 1,300 assistants, hygienists and 
other volunteers provided dental 
care from early morning until night 
in a 100-chair clinic in Phoenix. Many 
patients waited through the night in 
order to access the treatments avail -
able, ranging from cleanings, fillings 
and extractions to endodontic pro -
cedures, dentures and CEREC single 
visit dentistry. Dentsply Sirona donat -
ed material and set up four stations 
with two Omnicams each paired with 
MC X milling machine as well as two 
Primescan units each paired with 
their own MC XL mill and a backup 
mill on site for extra efficiency. Over 
the course of the event, 125 crowns 
were milled for patients.

America’s Dentists Care  
Foundation  
 
Another recipient of Dentsply Siro -
na’s support for dental missions in 
the U.S. is the America’s Dentists 
Care Foundation. ADCF, a national 
non-profit organization located  
in Wichita, KS, is dedicated to  
delivering oral healthcare to the  
underserved. By providing equip -
ment, instruments, and guidance, 
ADCF supports dental Mission of 
Mercy clinics and other charitable 
clinics that provide free dental care 
to any person who attends. It also 
supports larger-scale comprehen -
sive care clinics or smaller-scale 
clinics for specific populations, such 
as U.S. veterans.  
 
Since 2008, ADCF-supported clinics 
in 31 states have provided 300,000 
patients with $220 million in char -
itable oral healthcare. At a typical 
two-day clinic, about 1,000 dental 
and lay volunteers come together to 
serve an average of 1,500 patients. 
ADCF provides the tools. Dentists 
provide the care. Dentsply Sirona 
continues to support this invaluable 
organization with dental products 
and technologies.
Water Street Health Services  
 
The Water Street Mission in Lan-  
caster, PA helps those in need, 
including the homeless, by provid -
ing a number of services ranging 
from job placement, housing and 
meals as well as medical and dental 
care. For the latter, the organization 
relies on the commitment of 11 local 
dentists who donate their time to 
provide free dental treatment to 
local residents. For more than eight 
years, Dentsply Sirona has support -
ed the Water Street Mission, pro -
viding consumable dental products and small equipment as well as a 
treatment center for the clinic. 
Bringing dental care to a commu-  
nity health center in Belgium  
 
In 2018, Dentsply Sirona’s Belgian 
entity helped a neighborhood  
health center, De Central vzw,  
in Leuven to begin offering access 
to a dentist for low-cost dental care. 
In 2019, the cooperation with De 
Central moved beyond supplying 
the raw materials needed to  
provide care and support for a  
full-time dentist. Local Dentsply 
Sirona employees now actively  
contribute and volunteer with the 
health center by welcoming  
people at screening sessions that 
offer young children and parents a 
basic oral health check-up, and a 
plan for any needed treatment.  
They also playfully help educate  
the children about oral hygiene 
through a “tooth game.”  
 
Additionally, Dentsply Sirona  
employees’ professional skills  
in web design and development  
are put to use, for example in  
helping De Central with its re -
vamped website.
International College of Dentists  
 
The International College of Dentists 
(ICD) is an honor society for dentists that recognizes and promotes  
excellence in dentistry with an em -
phasis on service, and which aims 
to address oral health needs and 
education throughout the world. 
The 12,000 dentists who have been 
awarded the prestigious title of 
“Fellow” (FICD) are currently located 
in 122 countries worldwide. Dentsply 
Sirona is a sponsor in the Corporate 
Partnership program. ICD sponsors’ 
financial contributions aid in the or -
ganization’s mission of reaching any -
where and everywhere in the world 
where oral health can be improved. 
Saving smiles one front tooth at  
a time 
 
Dentsply Sirona’s team in the Philip-  
pines partnered with the the Tzu Chi 
Foundation and the ICD to provide 
endodontic equipment for a dental 
mission in October of 2019 to Ormoc 
City. The mission’s goal was  
to give root canal treatments to  
marginalized people for whom  
access is normally not available due 
to cost barriers. This particular project 
focused specifically on root canal 
treatment of the front teeth as well as 
restoring any other teeth where a root 
canal was not indicated. The project 
resulted in treatment for 21 patients 
between 13 and 39 years of age.  
The mostly teenage-aged patients 
were given their smiles back and 
their confidence boosted thanks to 
treatment.

Nine Miles of Smiles in Jamaica  
 
Since its founding in 2006, Nine 
Miles of Smiles (NMS) has worked 
to improve access to dental care. 
The non-profit healthcare volunteer 
organization provides free dental 
care to underserved communities 
in Jamaica. In 2019, Dentsply Sirona 
Canada donated artificial teeth, 
impression material, anesthetic 
material, and restorative material for 
a 10-day NMS clinic in the rural town 
of Polly Ground, Ewarton,  
St. Catherine. Dentsply Sirona  
Canada Warehouse Operations 
Manager Ken Cooper comes from 
this community, and he helped  
organize the logistics for Dentsply

volved extractions, manufacturing 
of dentures, cleaning, fillings and 
oral health education. In total, nearly 
1,000 patients were treated.Educational campaign promoting 
oral hygiene in Taiwan  
 
The importance of oral hygiene is 
often overlooked in Taiwan despite 
good oral healthcare coverage 
from the national health insurance. 
In order to address this issue, in 
2018, the colleagues at Dentsply 
Sirona Taiwan created an educa -
tional campaign to raise awareness 
that focused on the 88 community 
universities in Taiwan. Students at 
these universities are older – typical -
ly 40  to  60 years of age, consistent 
with the intended target group of 
the campaign.  
 
In 2019, with help from an external 
partner, Dentsply Sirona held 20 oral 
health lecture events at universities 
around the country – two more 
than the previous year. Dentsply 
Sirona provided speakers, lecture 
materials, and a small item such as 
a toothbrush or toothpaste. The 
Taiwan team also designed a patient 
brochure that includes basic dental 
information about teeth brushing, 
dental floss, scaling, dental cavities, 
periodontal disease, endodontics, 
dental implant, prosthetics and 
orthodontics.
Project 32 - every tooth matters  
 
Project 32’s goal is to improve 
comprehensive oral healthcare in 
Brazil through an efficient root canal 
technique with a standardized end -
odontic protocol that has a quick 
learning curve – the WaveOne Gold 
system. Dentsply Sirona provides 
the funding for Project 32 as well as 
the bespoke Maillefer endodontic 
solution. The program helps to make 
endodontic treatment more avail -
able and accessible to a population 
with limited access to dental prac -
tices due to their high costs. In 2019, four humanitarian actions were held 
in Brazil resulting in over 360 dental 
treatments, including 239 endo-  
dontic cases. It also provides  
courses and training and, in 2019, 
290 professionals were trained, 
including dentists, dental students 
and professors.
During NMS, volunteers created smiles on 
many faces in a rural area of Jamaica.Project 32 delivers dental care at the annual

Dentsply Sirona’s Clinical Affairs 
team develops and manages clinical 
education courses for dental profes -
sionals and their teams in communi -
ties all over the world. The Company 
invests significant resources into 
developing high quality courses 
and in the physical infrastructure of 
building its own training facilities 
around the world.  
 
From the end of 2018 through 
mid-2019, the 
Company opened 
four new train -
ing facilities in 
Singapore, Hong 
Kong, Jakarta, In -
donesia and Kuala 
Lumpur, Malaysia. 
Dentsply  
Sirona educa -
tional facilities 
currently number 59 facilities in 29 
countries. To highlight the impact of 
these education centers, the Compa -
ny’s Charlotte-based Academy wel -
comed more than 10,000 guests in 
2019. Overall, the Company’s 14,800 
clinical education programs reached 
more than 470,000 participants in 
2019. That represents an eight per -
cent increase from the year before.  
 
The Company continues to  
expand its course offerings based  
on the needs of local dental mar -
kets. Through its brand-new online 
Academy training platform in  
the U.S., even more courses are 
available. Visitors can choose  
from over 800 free educational  
video clips featuring experts in  
their respective fields, view and  
sign up for upcoming hands-on  
courses or take 170 on-demand 
courses available within the  
platform.Partnering with the International 
University of Catalonia, Spain  
 
Dentsply Sirona strengthened its 
collaboration with UIC Barcelona  
in 2019 through a contribution  
alongside the creation of the new  
Dentsply Sirona Chair within the 
Faculty of Dentistry. The Chair was 
created to develop joint research, 
dissemination and training activities 
from an int erdisciplinary point of 
view covering Restoration, Ortho -
dontics, Periodontics, Surgery / 
Implants and 
Endodontics. 
The goal of these 
cooperative ef -
forts is to ensure 
interdisciplinary 
dental treatment, 
which benefits 
patients. One of 
the first i nitiatives 
to be implement -
ed within the framework of the new 
chair is the Fellowship Project. This 
will allow training national and in -
ternational professionals to become 
references in their research projects 
in each respective area, thereby 
contributing to knowledge transfer 
in the dental sector.
Supporting student research  
 
In 1959, Dentsply Sirona and the 
American Dental Association  
initiated a competition for den -
tal students in the United States. 
Throughout the years, the compe -
tition has grown into a global one. 
Pre-doctoral students from around 
the world compete at local, nation -
al, and finally in an international 
competition. Now in its 60th year, 
the 2019 Student Competition for 
Advancing Dental Research and 
its Application (SCADA) Awards had 69 participants representing 
28 different countries. The SCADA 
program’s three aims remain:  
 
1 | To engage students to discover  
the importance and power of dental 
research  
2 | To provide opportunities for 
students to advance their research 
skills and careers  
3 | To inspire students to look for 
new ways to have a positive impact 
on dental care and oral health  
 
Dentsply Sirona also hosts a com -
petition in esthetic dentistry for 
students. This Global Clinical Case 
Contest (GCCC) has taken place an -
nually since 2004/2005, and dental 
students with less than two years of 
clinical practice are eligible. The par -
ticipants have access to the entire 
Dentsply Sirona Restorative product 
line for direct anterior and poste -
rior restorations. The competition 
also provides the opportunity to 
learn best practices in documenting 
successful treatment cases by using 
both text and images. Last year, 
there were 1,242 submissions from a 
total of 140 universities around the 
world. Three winners get the chance 
to gain professional exposure by 
attending a congress of high-caliber 
specialists.  
 
Over the past three years, Dentsply 
Sirona has given significant resources  
in funding for the annual Ameri -
can Dental Association Foundation 
Dentsply Sirona Research Award 
for Dual Degree Candidates. The 
award recognizes excellence in oral 
health research as conducted by 
a dual degree candidate (D.D.S./
Ph.D. or D.M.D./Ph.D.), with the goal 
of supporting his/her pursuit of a 
career in research that advances the » The target of the  
Company’s efforts is to 
expand the reach of clinical 
education programs and 
support the next generation 
of dental professionals.16
oral health of the public. The award 
provides up to $10,000 in funding, 
which may be used toward deve-  
loping an approved research  
project, attending one or more 
scientific conferences in order to 
advance knowledge or skills, and/
or to present his/her findings at a 
scientific conference.  
 The Dental Clinical Skills Competition 
is a creation of the Royal College 
of Surgeons Edinburgh (RCSEd), 
Scotland and sponsored by Dentsply 
Sirona. The competition is open to 
students from every dental school 
in the UK and Ireland. Heats are held 
across the country to determine 
each school’s representative in the 
Grand Final. Students were asked to demonstrate their individual 
skillsets across nine different areas, 
and Dentsply Sirona provided the 
materials and equipment for the 
competitors. In its fifth year, the com -
petition attracted over 500 entrants 
(representing half of final-year dental 
undergraduate students) and, once 
again, bridged the gap between the 
academic and the practical.
The DS Academy in 
Bensheim, Germany 
offers an ideal  
environment for the 
practical stage of a 
master’s program in  
endodontics.

» Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics 
Dentsply Sirona has a long-standing 
history and rep -
utation of ethical 
business practices 
throughout the 
global community.  
Through frequent, 
clear communi -
cations and in -
teractive training, Dentsply Sirona 
employees and business partners 
are informed that illegal or unethical 
conduct will not be tolerated. 
The Company’s Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics (the Code) 
sets forth guiding principles for the 
conduct of business that must be 
followed by everyone who does 
business on behalf of Dentsply  
Sirona and establishes the ex -
pectations for how the Company 
competes globally, with uncompro -
mising integrity in terms of its in -teraction with customers, suppliers, 
Key Opinion Leaders, and govern -
ment officials to assure compliance 
with all laws and regulations. It 
provides guidance 
on identifying and 
mitigating risk in 
a variety of areas 
and what to do if 
an issue is iden -
tified. Lastly, the 
Code underscores 
the Company’s commitment to its 
employees and the communities in  
which we live and work around the 
world. 
Company supervisors and man -
agers are responsible for ensuring 
compliance with the Code by their 
teams. All employees are responsi -
ble for acquiring sufficient knowl -
edge to recognize potential com -
pliance issues applicable to their 
duties and for appropriately seeking 
advice from subject matter experts 
regarding such issues.The Code has been distributed to 
all employees and sets forth the 
general standards relevant to the 
Company’s business and operations. 
In addition, there are numerous pol -
icies and procedures which provide 
more detailed guidance on a variety 
of topics. The Company commu -
nicates these specific policies to 
the employees who are particularly 
affected by them and seeks full 
compliance in the conduct of the 
Company’s business.  
Dentsply Sirona’s Marketing to Pro -
fessionals Code of Conduct requires 
that all interactions with medical 
and dental professionals are com -
pliant with applicable laws and reg -
ulations, as well as the Company’s 
core values and Operating Princi -
ples. Dentsply Sirona goes beyond 
strict legal standards and follows 
the highest ethical standards when 
interacting with healthcare profes -
sionals and institutions. Healthcare 
professionals are also Dentsply 
Sirona customers and their deci -18sions about which product to buy 
should be based on the quality and 
efficacy of the products and the 
best interests of their patients. The 
Company’s Marketing to Profession -
als Code of Conduct sets standards 
that ensure employees, or any other 
party working on behalf of the 
Company, do not unduly influence 
or even give the perception of  
impropriety in their interactions  
with healthcare professionals and 
organizations. Employees who 
interact with healthcare profession -
als and institutions are required to 
regularly train on the Marketing to 
Professionals Code of Conduct and 
agree to comply with this policy. 
There is also a network of Marketing 
Compliance Liaisons in place at each 
Dentsply Sirona business across 
the globe that actively engage in 
monitoring to ensure the concepts 
of the Marketing to Professionals 
Code of Conduct are understood, 
applied and enforced. Additionally, 
the Company is committed to the 
reporting requirements of the Phy -
sician Payment Sunshine Act (Open Payments) and other transparency 
laws worldwide.

Workplace
Dentsply Sirona is a leader in the dental industry and consistently strives to bring  
out the best in its people, for the benefit of dental patients, and the professionals  
who serve them. The educational programs offered by the Dentsply Sirona University  
represent the Company’s ongoing commitment to providing the best professio-  
nal development for its employees, helping them grow and develop as a part of  
the team that is shaping the oral healthcare industry. As a global organization with  
offices worldwide, its pledge to diversity and equal opportunity is also at the core  
of Dentsply Sirona’s workplace identity.321
The 2019 Global Leadership Development Program participants. GLDP offers a unique opportunity to partner and network with peers from across 
the organization.
Employee engagement and  
innovative communications  
 
In 2019, Dentsply Sirona conducted 
its second employee engagement 
survey to obtain feedback from 
the Company’s global team about 
what’s working well, what could be 
improved and to measure progress 
year over year. Employees shared 
their perspectives on topics like 
teamwork and collaboration, work 
environment, communication and 
leadership. The survey represents 
one of the ways in which Compa -
ny leaders listen to employees to continuously improve and to be an 
employer of choice.  
 
At Dentsply Sirona, communica -
tion is critical given the fast-paced, 
constantly evolving environment in 
which the business operates. It is 
important to consider the diverse 
audiences in the organization, how 
to best reach them and make sure 
the information is easy to access. To 
accomplish this, the Company con -
tinuously tries to improve and find 
new ways to communicate.  
 
One creative and engaging example in 2019 was DS24hours, a global 
town hall-style meeting held in  
a unique way. Some 13,000  
employees in 90 locations  
worldwide joined the event to  
discuss what matters: the  
Company’s Purpose & Mission  
and Operating Principles. The  
Leadership Team hosted discussions 
by video with employees at nearly  
every Dentsply Sirona location 
around the globe in an almost non-
stop livestream. CEO Don Casey and 
members of the Leadership Team 
addressed hundreds of questions 
submitted by employees.Talent development  
 
Helping new employees and those  
in new roles to quickly become 
acclimated increases their effective -
ness and their satisfaction at work. 
Dentsply Sirona employees partici -
pate in an onboarding process that 
includes formal training relevant to 
their roles.  
 
The Company also pilots programs 
that act as informal aids to support 
the onboarding process such as 
the Wisdom Tooth Program, which 
pairs new employees with buddies 
called “Wisdom Teeth.” Launched 
initially in the Company’s Austra -
lia and New Zealand locations, the 
Wisdom Teeth are employees who 
have been with Dentsply Sirona for 
at least 12 months and are special -
ly selected for their coaching and 
mentoring skills. Having a “buddy” 
at work can make a huge difference 
to the speed at which new employ -
ees manage to settle into their role, 
their new department and Dentsply 
Sirona’s processes and work envi -
ronment. Simply knowing that there 
is a colleague, other than a direct 
manager, who will listen and is gen -
uinely interested in helping the new 
employee manage the challenges

in training and career  
development programs 
aimed at ensuring every 
employee receives the 
appropriate training to excel 
in their roles and to provide 
a career path supporting 
employees’ goals.that come with starting a new job 
can make a big difference.  
 
To help employees transferring  
within the Company to the Bens-
heim, Germany location, an expe -
rienced colleague is assigned as a 
mentor. The Company also supplies 
vouchers for these newly arrived 
employees to take a city tour with 
small groups of other new employ -
ees to help them integrate and make 
connections. These programs have 
had a genuinely 
positive impact.  
 
Many Dentsply  
Sirona locations 
also support 
employees in their 
individual pro -
fessional devel -
opment through 
tuition assistance, 
enabling employ -
ees to complete 
their university 
education, while others have pur -
sued advanced degree programs. 
Career development is important 
both for the growth of the organiza -
tion and for talent retention. There -
fore, Dentsply Sirona invests in train -
ing and development programs to bring out the best in its employees 
and to ensure that it will continue to 
attract top talent across the globe.  
 
The Dentsply Sirona University is at 
the core of the Company’s training 
and development initiatives. The 
courses aim to develop skills in 
the areas of leadership excellence, 
commercial excellence, and oper -
ations excellence through a blend 
of classroom and online training for 
employees. For 2019, the program 
expanded its 
offering of digital 
courses through 
a new eLearning 
platform.  
 
Some of the pro -
grams within the 
Dentsply Sirona 
University take se -
lect groups of em -
ployees through 
year-long learning

and individual assessment. Among 
these programs, the Global Leader -

senior leaders in the Company.  
The 18-month program begins with 
each GLDP participant receiving 
personalized feedback and having a 
one-on-one development session in 
which individual development plans 
are created. In 2019, 20 participants from 17 locations in 12 countries 
took part.  
 
Another leadership development 
program at Dentsply Sirona focuses 
on women leaders. Several years 
ago, Dentsply Sirona launched a 
pilot program with 10 women from 
the York, PA location in the U.S. to 
develop and advance women lead -
ers at the Company. Known as the 
Women Inspired Network (WIN), the 
12-month program now includes  
participants from across the globe 
and has become a hallmark of the 
Company’s commitment to support -
ing the careers of talented female 
leaders. In 2019, 24 women from 10 
different countries joined WIN and 
took part in an educational jour -
ney which 
features 
networking, 
mentoring, 
individual

ning and

new mem -
bers join a 
network of

Sirona WIN 
members 
across the 
globe, all of 
whom are 
encouraged 
to stay  
connected and pass their learning to 
others within the Company and the 
community around them.  
 
In 2019, 214 employees completed 
programs in the College of Lead -
ership Excellence to which the 
aforementioned GLDP and WIN 
programs belong.Dentsply Sirona is also dedicated 
to supporting women outside the 
organization. The Company hosts a 
series of training sessions for  
women in an atmosphere designed 
to foster networking and the sharing  
of ideas under the banner of  
Women in Dentistry. In February of 
2019, the Company co-sponsored 
the seventh annual Women in Dental 
Technology (WIDT) Breakfast at  
the Chicago Midwinter Meeting.  
Dentsply Sirona’s Chief Clinical  
Officer, Dr. Theresa A. Dolan, also 
spoke at the 2019 Greater New York 
Dental Meeting’s Women Dentists 
Leadership Conference.  
 
In 2019, Dentsply Sirona’s Treatment 
Centers business launched its Smart 
Integration Award. The aim of the 
award program is to honor women 
in dentistry with ideas for optimiz -
ing workflows at their treatment 
centers and finding more convenient 
and efficient processes in the dental 
practice. On November 21, 2019, 24 
winners from seven countries were 
honored and presented with tro -
phies and certificates at a ceremony 
in Heidelberg, Germany. The win -
ners then took part in an exciting 
expert development program at the 
Dentsply Sirona office in Bensheim, 
Germany, which featured workshops 
and training on topics including 
smart integration, practice optimiza -
tion, and employee management.  
 
Each year, the Company also opens 
its workplaces to the future workforce 
in Germany on Girls’ Day, the world’s 
largest vocational orientation project. 
On March 28, 2019, at its Bensheim, 
Munich and Constance locations, the 
Company offered lectures, workshops 
and specific information on technical 
apprenticeships and dual study pro -
grams to a group of approximately 
40 girls between the ages of 10 and 
15 who represent our future.

Bensheim, Germany.Equal employment opportunity and 
inclusion  
 
Dentsply Sirona firmly believes that 
having a diverse workforce that 
draws on the talents and skills of 
people from across different back -
grounds and cultures helps to con -
tribute to an inclusive society and 
ensures the future sustainability of 
the business. The Company active -
ly promotes cultural diversity and 
inclusion in its talent recruitment, 
development and management 
strategies. Dentsply Sirona remains 
committed to the principles of equal 
employment opportunity. 
As an international business with lo -
cations around the world, local offic -
es typically reflect the culture of the 
country in which they operate. With 
roughly 15,000 employees at loca -
tions globally, diversity is celebrated 
as part of the Company culture. In 
Germany alone, there are currently 
about 3,700 employees represent -
ing 54 different nations. Dentsply 
Sirona participated in the seventh 
German Diversity Day, which took 
place May 28, 2019 with a number of 
colorful campaigns under the motto 
“Diversity can be experienced.” The 
employees all across Germany cre -
ated a photo collage on diversity. In 
Munich, employees shared a buffet that included homemade delicacies 
representing different parts of the 
world. In Bensheim, colleagues also 
enjoyed an international menu in 
the lunch canteen and tried home -
made variations of lemonade made 
with ingredients from different parts 
of the world. Both locations also 
held a Wheel of Fortune-inspired 
country quiz in 
which partici -
pants learned 
more about the 
cultural back -
grounds of their 
colleagues. 
The commitment 
to diversity and inclusion includes 
recruitment of diverse candidates 
throughout the business, including 
the Board of Directors and manage -
ment, in locations around the  
globe. In 2019, Dentsply Sirona  
welcomed Janet S. Vergis to its 
Board of Directors. The Company’s  
11-member board now includes  
three women. 
Employee training and information,  
available in multiple languages, 
maintains a focus on global diversity 
and appreciation of regional  
cultures. When filling an open  
position, every effort is made to 
include a group of qualified, diverse candidates. Job-specific qualifica -
tions, skills, and experience are the 
basis for recruitment, training, and 
advancement of employees at all 
levels. Dentsply Sirona’s policy is to 
fill positions with the most qualified 
candidates regardless of race, color, 
sex, age, national origin, disability, 
religion, sexual orientation, or  
veteran status, 
except where 
there is a bona 
fide occupational 
qualification. This 
policy applies to 
all decisions about 
recruitment, hiring, 
compensation,  
benefits, transfers, promotions, 
training, social programs, reductions 
in workforce, and any other  
conditions of employment. In line 
with this policy, Dentsply Sirona 
offers same and opposite gender  
domestic partner benefits to  
employees. Reasonable accommo -
dations are provided to qualified 
individuals with disabilities.  
 
Dentsply Sirona is committed to 
providing a workplace that is free  
of discrimination, in all aspects  
of employment. This practice is  
aligned with the core values of the  
Company as well as being a sound 
business practice.

Dentsply Sirona has a Global Well -
ness Program that focuses in differ -
ent areas each quarter. In 2019, the 
focus areas were oral health, mind -
fulness, physical health and heart 
health. The Company-wide program 
is designed for flexibility, enabling 
local offices to adapt it to best meet 
the needs of their local teams.
To correspond with World Oral  
Health Day, the first quarter is 
always dedicated to oral health. In 
2019, employees received tips for 
taking care of teeth with addition -
al information tailored to children 
and older adults. In the second 
quarter, employees received infor -
mation on the benefits of mind -
fulness through techniques such 
as meditation and yoga. Many 
offices and Dentsply Sirona sites 
around the world participated in 
fitness initiatives both to corre -
spond to the third quarter’s Well -
ness Program theme and through -
out the whole year. In the fourth 
quarter, employees were encour -
aged to live a heart healthy lifestyle 
and make healthy meal choices with 
a focus on diabetes prevention.
Colleagues in Munich, Germany 
implemented three of their own 
wellness campaigns in 2019 with the 
motto “Prevention and fitness in ev -
eryday work.” One initiative, known 
as Vitamin C Boost Days, offered 
employees freshly squeezed orange 
juice during the coldest period of 
winter. Later in July, a Fitness Day 
began with two runner workshops 
with professional support for both 
beginners and the advanced. The 
coaches gave tips on individual run -
ning style, gear as well as stretching 
and strengthening exercises. An in -
teractive lecture discussed opportu -
nities to be active in the workplace and included teaching small exer -
cises that can be easily integrated 
into everyday life. There were also 
shorter sessions focused on Pilates 
and simple back training. The third 
initiative supplemented the annu -
al offer of a flu vaccination at the 
workplace with several additional 
free preventive check-ups available. 
Employees could choose to have 
their blood pressure measured, get 
a check for heart health, a diabetes 
screening, and check that their  
vaccinations were up to date.
Employees across the U.S. took part 
in the 2019 Hike the Hills Walking 
Challenge. From September 1  
through 27, participants tracked 
their steps. The goal was to reach 
8,000 steps per day by gradually in -
creasing the step count each week. 
Participants had the choice to either 
manually track their steps each day 
by wearing a pedometer or through 
their preferred app to track steps 
online. Each week, participants 
competed for the top spot in steps 
through a Live Leader Board. By 
the end of the challenge, nearly 200 
employees submitted their steps 
resulting in an impressive combined 
total of 43,628,015 steps.
Dentsply Sirona employees across 
the Middle East and North Africa 
region took part in the annual Dubai 
Fitness Challenge, which drew over 
1 million participants last year. The 
fitness challenge includes a corpo -rate competition among hundreds 
of organizations from all over the 
region. This was the third time 
Dentsply Sirona employees compet -
ed. Throughout the 30 days, there 
are fitness events and wellness-  
focused programs including men’s 
and women’s soccer, yoga, Zum -
ba, darts and a dance contest all 
designed to keep Dubai citizens up 
and on their feet. Dentsply Sirona 
MENA planned various health events 
as an organization, including cardio, 
skipping, balancing, indoor soccer 
and planking.
Safety in the workplace  
 
The Company maintains a strong 
focus on safety within its culture, 
empowering and supporting its  
people to recognize and control  
safety risk, as well as assuring 
compliance with applicable safety 
regulations.  
 
Employees receive safety training to 
recognize and control safety  
hazards as well as implement  
programs to support ongoing regu -
latory compliance. The Company is 
also developing a global EHS audit 
program that will be implemented in 
2020 to validate regulatory compli -
ance and identify risk improvement  
opportunities.
There are many local initiatives to 
promote new ideas within the Com -
pany’s culture of safety. For exam -
ple, in 2019 at the Ballaigues, Swit -
zerland site, the Company piloted 
its “6S Chemical Products” project. 
Standardized safe chemical storage 
facilities were installed, resulting 
in improved separation of reactive 
chemicals. Chemical safety informa -
tion is also highly visible so employ -
ees can immediately recognize the 
specific hazards and the required 
safe handling and use requirements.  » The Company’s Global  
Wellness Program provides

Supporting the York, PA  
community  
 
An example of Dentsply Sirona and 
its employees giving back locally is 
York campus employees continuing 
their support for the United Way 
of York County, Pennsylvania. The 
United Way is a non-profit organiza -
tion that helps to provide financial 
assistance, educational programs for 
children, training programs for skill 
development, and access to health -
care services for those in need. The 
Company and its employees cont-  
ributed a generous amount to the 
York County annual campaign and 
community in 2019.
Additionally, Dentsply Sirona’s 
Global Business Services (GBS) in 
York has a “Give-Back” Committee 
to support the employees’ desire to 
help the local community. In 2019, 
the Committee collected 370 books 
for the United Way’s #yorkreads 
Programs, 130 wish list items for 
York County SPCA, and 95 items for 
distribution by Coats of Friendship.  
Hands-on with Habitat for  
Humanity  
 
Twenty associates from Dentsply 
Sirona’s headquarters location in Dentsply Sirona strives to have a positive impact on the communities in which its  
employees work and live. Therefore, giving back to and investing in these communities 
is part of the Company’s social responsibility strategy, and it’s simply the right thing 
to do. With workplaces all over the world, the Company partners with and supports a 
variety of organizations and initiatives working locally but also nationally and across 
borders. The following examples illustrate some of the many ways that Dentsply  
Sirona and its employees act as responsible local and global citizens by supporting 
communities and getting involved to make a difference.
Employees in Charlotte volunteered locally with Habitat for Humanity to build a home for a  
family in need.28
Charlotte, NC volunteered with a 
local chapter of Habitat for Human-  
ity. More than a third of the families 
that reside in Matthews, a suburb of 
Charlotte, struggle with poverty or 
are considered “house poor,”  
meaning that they spend more than 
30% of their income on a place to 
live. On September 20, 2019,  
working in two shifts, the Dentsply  
Sirona volunteers spent the day 
putting up scaffolding, preparing 
cabinet blocking for the walls and completing the preparation of  
trusses for the roof of a house  
being built for a family in need in 
Matthews. In addition to donating  
time and manpower, Dentsply  
Sirona financially contributed  
to the build.  
The power of a smile  
 
In 2019, Japan experienced a pair of 
particularly strong typhoons –  
Typhoon Faxai, a Category 4 storm, 
and Typhoon Hagibis, a Category 5 
super typhoon. The typhoons  
caused significant loss of life and  
damage to areas of the country.  
Roughly 90,000 homes were 
flooded or destroyed forcing many 
people to move to evacuation  
centers. These events affected many 
businesses including those of dental 
professionals. 
To help with the reconstruction of 
areas stricken by these disasters, 
Dentsply Sirona began its Smile 
Campaign asking its employees 
to take photographs with dental 
professionals, customers, partners, 
family members and colleagues 
in order spread some happiness 
and hope through their smiles. The 
photographs were then promot -
ed digitally through social media, 
printed and sent to the afflicted 
areas. The Company matched each 
photograph with a donation given 
to municipalities in need. A total of 
564 photos were collected and a 
sizable donation was made to Japan 
Platform, a Non-Governmental 
Organization (NGO) that works with 
local NGOs to distribute emergency 
humanitarian assistance under their 
immediate action disaster plans. 
The campaign provided hope and 
encouragement and the humanity 
of a simple smile to communities 
working hard to rebuild.  Footy Colours Day fundraiser in  
Australia  
 
Dentsply Sirona in Australia and 
New Zealand held a Footy Colours 
Day and Bake Sale on September 
26th to support children living with 
cancer. The Footy Colours Day is 
a national fundraising campaign in 
Australia established in 1995 and 
held each year during the month of 
September. On the day of the fund -
raiser, employees wore their favorite 
football team colors with pride and 
participated in fundraising activities 
such as a BBQ and raffle. Thanks to 
these fundraisers and several other 
fundraising efforts in 2019, employ -
ees made a four-figure donation 
to two charities, the Breast Cancer 
Network Australia (BCNA) and  
Cancer Council Victoria.  
Taking initiative to bring joy to  
children in the hospital  
 
In the first quarter of 2019, Dentsply 
Sirona’s team in United Arab Emir -
ates led a n initiative for their local 
community. The staff brought in 
items of worn clothing to sell at a 
charity event in order to raise funds 
to buy gifts for children at the Al  
Jaleel Children’s Hospital in Dubai. 
The aim was to give the children an 
educational item and to then spend 
time reading and playing with the 
young patients in the hospital. The 
entire Communication, Social and 
Culture team participated to bright -
en the children’s day.

In 2019, Dentsply Sirona also made 
a donation to Friends, a non-profit 
agency that focuses on tolerance 
and preventing bullying for children 
and young people through different 
aspects of their lives. To support 
their work, the Company purchased 
their Christmas calendar and distrib -

Recycling gold used in dentistry to 
benefit children with cancer  
 
For nearly 20 years, Dentsply Sirona 
has worked in cooperation with the 
Tyrol Dental Association in Austria 
and dentists in the region to col -
lect and process scrap dental gold 
and other precious metals donated 
by patients. The proceeds from 
the recovered precious metals go 
entirely to the Children’s Cancer Aid 
Tyrol and Vorarlberg. Over the years, 
patients have donated an incredible 1.9 million Euros worth of precious 
metals. For the current cycle of 
materials, collected biannually, the 
donations amounted to an impres -
sive six-figure sum.  
Record donation to Bergstrasse  
Hospice, Germany  
 
The annual Christmas donation 
for a local charitable organization 
is a matter close to the heart for 
the employees of Dentsply Sirona 
Bensheim. Bergstrasse Hospice is 
an organization that gives people 
with highly advanced incurable 
diseases palliative care and a home 
during their last days of life, and 
it benefits from several thousand 
Euros contributed by the Dentsply 
Sirona team every year. During the 
pre-Christmas period at the Bens-
heim site, donation boxes were 
situated around the facility. As in 
previous years, the sales from a 
calendar featuring regional scenery, 
created by employee and hobby 
photographer Norbert Göller, con -
tributed to the collected funds as 
well. Special for this year was that 
the proceeds from a fundraising ini -
tiative held at the 2019 International 
Dental Show (IDS) earlier in the year 
also flowed into the donation sum 
from Bensheim. At IDS, a cycling 
campaign was held where employ -
ees volunteered to ride stationary 
bicycles for a good cause. For every 
meter cycled, 1 Euro was donated. 
Thanks to the generosity of employ -
ees and their engagement at IDS, 
as well as the contribution made by 
the Company, a record amount was 
donated in 2019.  
Throwing stars symbolize the fight 
against childhood cancers  
 
Dentsply Sirona’s Iberia office con -tinues to support the Shurikan Star 
Association. Originally conceived by 
two 10-year-old children in order to 
raise money for research into child -
hood cancers, the Shurikan Project 
is a wonderful initiative that the 
Dentsply Sirona team is proud to 
support. In 2019, the team hosted a 
workshop at its Barcelona office and 
helped to make these papier-mâché 
throwing stars. The stars were then 
mailed out to clients with letters to 
raise awareness for the project. This 
year’s donation went to the Sant 
Joan de Déu Hospital in Barcelona 
for the Pediatric Cancer Center lab -
oratory, the largest pediatric cancer 
center in Europe, to investigate a 
cure for osteosarcoma – a type of 
cancer that affects the bones.30
A Shurikan star to raise money for childhood 
cancer.Dentsply Sirona opened a new 
chapter in digital dentistry with 
the introduction of Primescan, the 
intraoral scanner with a new digital 
impressioning technology enabling 
high-precision scans of the entire 
jaw. These scans present numerous 
possibilities for users. Primescan was 
designed for various digital work -
flows – with the laboratory directly 
in the practice, with CEREC or in 
cooperation with external partners. 
Validated interfaces noticeably sim -
plify the process, offering dentists 
the flexibility they desire.  
 
Azento, the latest digital implant 
workflow solution from Dentsply  
Sirona, streamlines the implant  
planning, purchasing and delivery  
of products. For the clinician, this  
custom implant solution increas -
es convenience, seamlessly and 
efficiently connects with qualified 
laboratories, and enables consistent, 
excellent results for patients.  Cercon xt Multilayer (ML) is the 
latest innovative material in Dentsply 
Sirona’s range of zirconium oxide 
disks. With its natural color gradient 
from incisal to dentin, this new and 
exciting product provides life-like 
esthetics, reliable color accuracy and 
faster production processing.  
 
Surefil one, an innovative filling con -
cept for the posterior tooth region, 
also attracted a high level of interest at 
IDS. Surefil one allows dentists to treat 
a cavity without any etching, bonding 
or retentive preparation in just one 
layer. After the material is placed into 
the cavity and briefly sculpted with 
an instrument, it can be light-cured 
for immediate finishing and polishing. 
With Surefil one filling procedures 
have been significantly improved and 
simplified.

duced a new generation of tailor-  
made X-ray units to better suit the 
needs of practitioners: Orthophos E, 
Orthophos S, and the prized Ortho -
phos SL – each providing a different 
range of features that allow the prac -
titioner to image, diagnose, and treat 
for higher case acceptance. Due to 
this diversification, the ideal solution 
is available to everyone, from new 3D

Pre-clinical testing  
 
Dentsply Sirona develops and  
licenses numerous medical devices 
for use in dental care applications. 
The Company strives to develop 
innovations that represent significant 
improvements to the status quo. 
Whenever possible, Dentsply Sirona 
uses in-vitro or benchtop methods 
that do not require testing on  
animals. When studies involving 
animals are absolutely necessary 
(e.g., when required by law, regula -
tion or standards) to establish safety, 
Dentsply Sirona uses facilities that 
follow the relevant national guide -
lines for the Care and Use of Animals. 
In the U.S., this follows 21CFR Part 58 
and 9CFR Parts 1-3 and global ISO 
10993-2 (Animal Welfare Require -
ments). These guidelines require that 
all studies be approved by an Institu -
tional Animal Care and Use Commit -
tee and the number of animals are 
limited to the minimum amount pos -
sible to demonstrate safety and effi -
cacy prior to human clinical studies. 
The 3R principle of replace, reduce 
and refine is always applied. Dentsp -
ly Sirona partners with institutions 
with highest ethical standards and 
they calculate the minimum number 
of animals required. Within these 
facilities, animal research monitoring is required to ensure that the animals 
are treated safely and humanely.  
Clinical testing  
 
Prior to commercializing innovative 
products, Dentsply Sirona often uti -
lizes data from human clinical tests. 
The company conducts all studies 
with human subjects in a manner 
that protects the safety and rights 
of patients and investigators. In 
addition to protecting the rights of 
individuals, including confidentiality, 
Dentsply Sirona complies with regu -
latory requirements of the countries 
in which studies are conducted and 
those in which regulatory submis -
sions take place. Its practice ensures 
that controls are in place and fol -
lowed to protect the integrity of the 
study results.  
 
Dental amalgam  
 
Dental amalgam, which is com -
posed of a mixture of metals such 
as silver, mercury, copper, and tin, is 
considered a safe, affordable, and 
durable material that has been used 
for over 100 years to restore teeth 
affected by dental caries (tooth 
decay). It has a long-established 
record of safety and effectiveness. 
While it has been the subject of 
questions because of its mercury 
content, dental amalgam has been 
studied and reviewed extensively 
and continues to be preferred and 
used by dental professionals in  
certain clinical applications.  
Dentsply Sirona sells numerous 
restorative products that are alter -
natives to amalgam. Many organiza -
tions, including the American Dental 
Association (ADA), Federation Den -
taire Internationale (World Dental 
Federation) and the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), support the 
use of dental amalgam. The Com -pany has 
reviewed 
and evaluated its 
dental amalgam prod -
uct line.This review included assess -
ment of a wide range of factors 
including the clinical effectiveness 
of amalgam, published scientific 
studies regarding material safety, 
the results of the FDA review of 
dental amalgam, as well as envi -
ronmental and legal considerations. 
Based on an internal assessment 
and published industry research, 
Dentsply Sirona concludes that 
dental amalgam continues to be a 
useful restorative material whose 
safety and efficacy have been ex -
tensively documented.
Based on this assessment and the 
needs of customers, Dentsply Sirona 
expects to continue to responsi -
bly manufacture and sell dental 
amalgam while focusing research 
and development investments on 
advanced alternative dental-restor -
ative materials. In agreement with 
the Minamata Convention, Dentsply 
Sirona supports the consensus for 
a phase-down approach, ratified by 
the Convention and signed by over 
100 countries, to reduce the use of 
dental amalgams. Dentsply Sirona’s 
marketing efforts and educational 
activities are designed to educate 
clinicians about the benefits and 
techniques for using today’s state-
of-the-art alternative restorative  
solutions. In addition, the Company 
continues to promote the use of the 
ADA’s Best Management Practices 
for Amalgam Waste to customers 
who choose to use dental amalgam. 
Finally, Dentsply Sirona supports 
a variety of industry-wide initia -
tives to promote prevention of 
oral health disease, which in turn, 
reduces the need for restorative 
procedures.32

Environment,  
Health & Safety
633
Dentsply Sirona’s commitment to the protection of the environment and the communities it 
serves is at the core of its identity. The Company’s success arises from and through the  
education and empowerment of its people to recognize risk and act accordingly, supported 
by leadership at every level. Dentsply Sirona’s site and corporate teams regularly engage 
with each other and key stakeholders to cooperatively ensure the Company’s commitment  
remains focused on the issues impacting the community the most. Sites are encouraged  
to engage locally and across the organization to develop solutions. In this section, just a  
few examples of the Company’s efforts to address energy efficiency, waste and water  
management, and health and safety challenges will be presented.
Dentsply Sirona continues to improve on the foundational 
management systems that guide the Company’s efforts 
and to set challenging goals and targets ensuring future 
success. The Company will invest significantly in its global 
Front Line Leadership Environmental, Health & Safety 
capability during 2020 and beyond. Dentsply Sirona con -
tinues to monitor activities across its operational network 
to ensure continued focus on the health and safety of em -
ployees and local communities and will develop and share 
more specific metrics in next year’s sustainability report.Environmental stewardship  
 
As a global industry leader, Dentsply Sirona recognizes its 
environmental responsibility and strives to continually  
improve the Company’s environmental footprint.  
Dentsply Sirona’s global team executed numerous  
projects around the world, many initiated at the site level 
through empowered work teams uniquely positioned to 
address localized opportunities. The following highlights 
recent energy, waste and water initiatives.In 2019, the 
Molndal, Sweden 
site began 
implementing 
an energy policy 
focused on  
energy efficiency 
and renewable 
energy.34
Dentsply Sirona continually seeks to improve  
internal reporting, to identify applicable best 
practices in waste management and to implement 
these, including a further reduction of the  
limited amount of hazardous waste generated. 
Some examples shared by the Company’s  
manufacturing sites include:  
• In-line process piping, eliminating manual  
additions and material losses
• Installation of water coolers to eliminate  
single-use plastic waste
• Waste incineration for heat recovery (at partner 
facilities)
• Reduction of production waste through use of 
digital tools and Lean methodology
• Eliminating printing of Instructions for Product 
Use documents
• Paper recycling programs
Examples of water management programs include  
reducing process wash water and incorporating 
closed-loop and water quenching systems to replace 
once through cooling systems. Sanitary water  
consumption has been reduced through installation  
of hands-free motion sensors in restrooms.  
 
Dentsply Sirona Implants in Molndal installed  
equipment that controls the emissions released into 
the wastewater system by adjusting the pH of the  
process water before discharge into the sewage  
network. This helps reduce stress on the sewage 
pipes, which is important as the production volume 
increases. The work took place in consultation with the 
municipality of Molndal and will be ongoing in 2020. In 2019, the Molndal, Sweden site implemented an 
energy policy focused on driving energy efficiency 
and increasing the use of renewable energy. Through 
this commitment, the site has commissioned more 
efficient equipment and started a program to install 
LED lighting throughout the facility. While the site  
already utilizes some renewable energy, it is continu -
ing to explore opportunities to increase solar energy 
use and further energy savings in the future.
At the Hanau, Germany site, energy reduction efforts 
include transitioning from halogen to LED lighting, 
installing motion sensors, and minimizing compressor 
runtime by reducing system air leaks. The Rossbach, 
Germany site has installed heat recovery on its kilns 
which augments comfort heating at the facility. Heat 
recovery technology is anticipated to reduce annual 
energy purchase by 955 MMBtu.
Dentsply Sirona has gained additional energy and 
emissions improvements across U.S. and European 
sites by moving to natural gas from fuel oil, replacing 
pumps and motors with variable frequency drives, 
equipment replacements with increased efficiency 
ratings, and introducing new technology to replace 
hydraulic injection molding.  
 
The Bensheim, Germany site is a member of the 
Learning Energy Efficiency Networks (LEEN)  German chapter with nine other German facilities,  
focused on sharing and leveraging experience to benefit 
energy efficiency. Through this effort, the LEEN network 
has collaborated to collectively reduce CO2 emissions 
over 90 tons per year since 2015 (base year) through  
various best practices to reduce electricity consumption.
Dentsply Sirona’s site in Ballaigues, Switzerland has 
achieved the Minergie certification for a new building 
occupying approximately one third of the total site’s 
building area based upon energy efficiency and use  
of renewable energy, as well as a healthy and energy-  
efficient ventilation system.
The Molndal site has also modified its coating process  
to enable the use of solvents with lower environmental  
impact through reduction our use of water and chemi -
cals. Its new solvent is from a renewable resource, instead 
of fossil based. The new environmental permit approved 
in 2019 enables the conversion.
Dentsply Sirona has also begun to focus on Scope 3  
emissions at the Molndal site by reducing business travel.  
Between 2018 and 2019, the site achieved a 31% reduction 
in greenhouse gas emissions per sold unit by increasing 
the number of digital meetings, choosing to travel by  
train more often and with a more restrictive travel policy  
in general.

Safety & health  
 
Dentsply Sirona maintains a vital 
focus on reducing the potential  
for worker injury or illness across  
the organization. Each year, sites  
consider and implement necessary 
activities to further improve worker 
health and safety. For example, the 
Hanau, Germany and Pirassununga, 
Brazil sites continue to implement 
process engineering improvements 
to further reduce the risk associated 
with potential exposure to acidic  
vapors and volatile organic com -
pounds. Dentsply Sirona identifies environmental health, safety and 
security strategic risk control  
opportunities through its EHS  
Aspect Review process implemen-  
ted beginning in 2019 and continuing 
through 2020. This key Company 
EHS management system standard 
lays the foundation for protection of 
its people and the environment. Each 
site cross-functional team identifies 
applicable EHS Aspects, characte-  
rizes uncontrolled risk and deve-  
lops an action plan to mitigate risk 
to an acceptable level. EHS Aspect 
Reviews and action plan progress 
are regularly re-evaluated to ensure 
identification of new or unrecognized 
risks, and that ongoing risk controls 
remain effective.  
 
EHS standards and programs  
apply to all workers, contractors, 
and visitors. New employees receive 
additional health and safety empha- 
sis through their training, in order to 
introduce them to the unique work 
environment at Dentsply Sirona and 
ensure development of safe working 
practices and behaviors. For instance, 
at the Ballaigues, Switzerland facility 
a health and safety video explains the 
EHS rules to all new employees and 
visitors. Each year, employees revisit 
this training and related procedures 
to maintain their focus on safety.  
 
Product stewardship  
 
Product stewardship begins with our 
New Product Introduction process 
and is the foundation of our product 
management programs. From new 
product development through  
commercialization to customer  
partnerships, Dentsply Sirona is  
committed to continual evaluation  
of our materials and products.  
 
The Molndal Wellspect and Implant 
businesses have implemented an 
Alternatives Assessment Process. 
Through this effort, the site has  
reviewed more than 100 materials 
and is evaluating the opportunity 
during 2020 to substitute or mini -
mize these materials with environ -
mentally preferred alternatives.  
 
Community engagement  
 
Dentsply Sirona’s dedication to the 
environment is not limited by its 
fence line. The Company recognizes 
the critical role pollination plays in 
feeding the planet. Industrialization 
has impacted the pollinator eco-

30,000 bees which are attended  
by a professional beekeeper.  
In addition to improving the local  
ecosystem, the beehives are  
providing an educational opportunity 
for employees – and honey!Political Spending7
In 2019, Dentsply Sirona did not use 
corporate funds for political spend -
ing or lobbying on political issues, 
and the Company does not have a 
political action committee. As stated 
in our Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics, the Company’s established 
policy is that no Company funds 
or other Company assets may be 
contributed for political purposes, regardless of whether in the U.S. or 
outside the U.S., without the prior 
review by the Company’s General 
Counsel and approval by the Board 
of Directors.  
 
In the U.S., Dentsply Sirona is a  
member of various dental trade
