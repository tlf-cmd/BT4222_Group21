Letter from Our  
Chairman & CEO
As I write this, the world is going through a period of 
significant uncertainty and change. From the health and economic crises brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, to the critical goal of achieving an inclusive and equitable society, to the urgent need for action  to address climate change, the global community faces multifaceted challenges.
The effect of these challenges on human lives cannot 
be overstated. Individuals and families are struggling to meet basic needs and navigating a world that is suddenly more virtual and isolated. There are stories  of hope, perseverance and grit; but we cannot ignore pervasive inequalities that continue to plague the communities where we live and work. Global leaders, the business community and each one of us must commit to action, dialogue and change to address these inequalities directly and underscore with urgency that Black Lives Matter. 2As CEO, I must ensure that Visa adapts to the realities 
of the time. Building trust, connection and community 
has never been more important. As a network of 
networks, Visa helps keep commerce running safely 
and securely, enabling nearly $12 trillion in total 
payments and cash volume worldwide annually.  
We are partnering with small businesses to develop 
solutions to new business challenges supporting 
communities in need. Visa is committed to maintain 
our role as an open, collaborative partner and leader  
as the long-term economic recovery begins.
Around the world, companies like Visa are doubling 
down on our commitments to be part of the  
solution. In 2019, on behalf of our 20,000 employees, I 
personally signed the Business Roundtable’s statement 
on the Purpose of a Corporation, a significant moment 
in the continued evolution of the role the private 
sector plays in society. My signature reflects Visa’s 
steadfast commitment to work toward our vision of an 
inclusive and sustainable world through service to a 
broad set of stakeholders — including our employees, 
clients, investors, local communities, governments, 
regulators, broader society and our planet. 
With this as a backdrop, I am pleased to share Visa’s 
annual Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability 
Report, detailing our continued progress to connect 
the world and enable individuals, businesses and 
economies to thrive. I am proud of the efforts of our 
global team across the Visa areas of focus, including 
these 2019–2020 highlights:
  Our achievement of the 2015 goal to provide  
500 million previously unbanked or underserved 
people with access to a Visa branded payment 
account by 2020.  Our work to support women’s economic 
empowerment by leveraging the full reach of our 
network, brand and financial resources, including 
our She’s Next and SheTrades initiatives and our 
expanded sponsorship of women athletes, teams 
and sports events.
  Our efforts to expand employee opportunities 
through learning and development resources  
and a renewed emphasis on taking our inclusive 
culture to the next level by increasing diversity 
across our teams.
  Our leadership in protecting consumers and 
commerce alike by championing ecosystem  
security including, among other topics, 
cybersecurity and tokenization.
  Our progress in minimizing Visa’s environmental 
impact and contributing to climate action by 
achieving our goal of a 100 percent renewable 
electricity transition by 2020, and by expanding our 
efforts to inspire and empower sustainable living 
through our work with transit agencies and the 
sustainable travel industry.
  Our recent announcement of the Visa Black Scholars 
and Jobs Program, a $10 million fund to provide 
scholarships to college-bound Black and African 
American students. Upon graduation, all recipients 
who have met their commitments will be 
guaranteed a full-time job with Visa.
All Visa efforts are built upon our solid foundation of 
operating responsibly, ethically and transparently. This 
foundation also includes our commitment to strong 
and independent oversight by our Board, our culture 
of ethics and integrity, our respect of human rights and 
our political transparency and accountability. I am also proud of the third-party recognition of our work, 
including being listed as one the World’s Most  
Ethical Companies, as a member of the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index and as one of the 100 Most  
Just Companies. 
As I look to the remainder of 2020 and beyond, I  
share Visa’s renewed and strengthened commitment 
to be a leader working collaboratively toward an  
inclusive and sustainable future. We must continue  
to take direct action to create pathways for the 
underserved to become part of the formal financial 
system. We must invest further in small and micro 
businesses — particularly women-owned — to help 
economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic 
stronger than ever. We also must continue to take 
urgent climate action in support of the transition  
to a clean, decarbonized and sustainable global 
economy. We recognize that we will not always  
have all the answers, but we believe we can always  
be part of the solution.
Now, I invite you to read further about Visa’s 
commitment to, and progress toward, a more resilient 
and sustainable future — for everyone, everywhere. 
Sincerely, 
Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Visa

2020 Updat
e
While the time period covered by this Report primarily 
is 2019, we believe it is important to provide an overview of our responses to two major challenges  in 2020: the global health and economic crises  caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the urgent calls for racial and social justice and equity. 
Visa’s Response to COVID-19 
At Visa, we are committed to supporting individuals, businesses and communities around the world as we navigate the evolving social and economic impacts  of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the outbreak began, Visa took many actions to support our stakeholders,  as noted below, and we remain committed to contributing to long-term recovery. Employees Our top priority throughout has been the health and safety of our employees and their families. To support our employees during this time, we significantly expanded opportunities for remote work, established specialized engagement and feedback initiatives, broadened benefit offerings and committed that there would be no employee layoffs in calendar year 2020 related to COVID-19. We implemented multi-faceted employee communications initiatives, offered additional Employee Assistance Program (EAP) counseling sessions and conducted a global Employee Pulse Survey to understand and respond to employee needs. 
Clients 
We worked closely with our clients to ensure business continuity while addressing needs emerging from the pandemic and taking actions to help bring stability  
and minimize disruption to the payments ecosystem. We also further deployed our tap to pay service, which has provided issuers and merchants with a “touchless” solution as they seek to reduce the need for cardholders to make physical contact at the point-of-sale terminal.
Small and Micro Businesses & Community Support
The Visa Foundation announced a five-year commitment of $200 million to support the long-term economic recovery of small and micro businesses with a focus on fostering women’s economic advancement. In addition, the Visa Foundation committed $10 million to support immediate relief efforts of frontline charitable organizations such as public health and food relief.
Frontline Workers 
We recognize that indispensable frontline workers  are among the most heavily impacted by the pandemic. Visa partners with Earned Wage Access (EWA) technology providers like DailyPay, FlexWage, Instant Financial, PayActiv and ZayZoon, to help  hourly workers access their earned wages in real-time* using Visa Direct.
Governments
Visa has worked closely with governments around the world to respond to the crisis in a number of ways. For example, Visa partnered with the United States Internal Revenue Service and other stakeholders to help deliver the U.S. government’s Economic Impact Payment  to millions of citizens via prepaid debit card. Visa also developed a virtual prepaid solution to rapidly expand the Dominican Republic government's emergency disbursements from 800,000 to 1.5 million beneficiaries.
* Actual fund availability varies by receiving financial institution, 
receiving account type, region, and whether transaction is domestic 
or cross-border. Visa requires U.S. issuers to make funds available  
to its cardholders within a maximum of 30 minutes of approving  
the transaction.Visa’s Support of Racial  
and Social Justice 
At Visa, we are on a journey to be completely inclusive 
and diverse. While we have made progress, we 
recognize there is more to do. To play a bigger role in 
stopping discrimination and racial injustice we have 
implemented a three-pronged approach focusing  
on our people, our community and our company.
Our People
We commit to continuing to enrich our team with  
Black and African American talent across the company, 
particularly in leadership roles. We established the 
following U.S. goals and will hold ourselves accountable  
and track progress:
  Increase the number of individuals from  
under-represented groups at the vice president  
level and above in the U.S. by 50 percent in 3 years
  Increase the number of under-represented Visa 
colleagues in the U.S. by 50 percent in 5 years
We are especially proud of our $10 million investment in 
the creation of the Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program, 
offering scholarships specifically for college-bound 
Black and African American students. Upon graduation 
and completion of an internship, all recipients who have 
met their commitments will be guaranteed a full-time 
job with Visa. 
Our Community 
We are leveraging education and conversation to equip 
our employees to be active allies. Part of these efforts 
include a Visa-hosted ongoing “Race Talk” series that 
provides a platform to speakers to address the Black 
experience in America and the impact it is having on 
society today. We also offered double-matching of our employees’ 
donations to key organizations that support racial 
justice and equality. As a result of this program, in June 
2020, we raised over $1.4 million for three organizations: 
the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, the 
ACLU Foundation and the National Urban League.
Our Company 
As we focus on increasing diversity within Visa, we  
also look to hold our suppliers to the same standards. 
Several actions we are undertaking to diversify our 
supply chain include:  Requesting diverse account teams from preferred 
suppliers and partners
  Increasing the number of diverse suppliers in  
our network
  Directly requiring diverse spend and sourcing 
options in supplier requests for proposals, and 
indirectly through supplier sources.  
The Visa community is united in doing our part to 
improve our inclusion, increase our diversity and help 
each other cope in these challenging times.

Materiality * 
To inform our corporate responsibility and sustainability 
strategy, Visa maintains engagement with various 
stakeholder groups. We also conduct a biennial ESG 
materiality assessment in accordance with the  
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and reassess 
our approach to managing priority topics during  
interim years.
In 2019, we completed our most recent 
comprehensive assessment, which incorporated 
developments in our business, recent trends, 
regulatory changes and stakeholder expectations  
that have emerged since our last formal assessment  
in 2017.
* In this report, our use of the terms “material,” “materiality” and other similar 
terms refers to topics that reflect Visa’s significant economic, social and 
environmental impacts or that substantially influence the assessments and 
decisions of a diverse set of stakeholders. We are not using these terms as 
they are used under the securities or other laws of the United States or any 
other jurisdiction or as these terms are used in the context of financial 
statements and financial reporting.Materiality Refresh Process 
During the 2019 assessment, we engaged a range of 
internal and external stakeholders and sources to 
include perspectives representative of Visa’s reach, 
impact and influence. Through our efforts, we 
considered clients, policymakers, investors, ESG ratings 
agencies, corporate peers and Visa’s internal leadership 
from across the business. The process included the 
following steps:
1.  Benchmarking: We researched competitors,  
peers and sustainability leaders to understand  
the current ESG landscape.
2.  Identification: We reviewed a broad set of 
stakeholder sources to identify ESG issues  
most relevant to Visa.
3.  Prioritization: We interviewed internal and external 
stakeholders to capture their perspectives on  
the most salient ESG risks and opportunities to  
our business.
4.  Validation: We shared assessment results with  
our internal leadership to confirm the final 
prioritization of topics and to help us refine  
our existing sustainability strategy.
Our assessment revealed moderate shifts in topics  
and prioritization since 2017. For internal and  
external stakeholders, cybersecurity, human capital 
management, unbanked/underserved communities 
and small and micro enterprises continued to be 
reinforced as significant issues. Newer topics of 
importance included: sustainable consumption, 
climate change, open trade/economic inclusion  
and future workforce. We continue to evolve our 
programs and initiatives to reflect changes in the 
materiality assessment. Governance of Corporate  
Responsibility & Sustainability
At Visa, corporate responsibility and sustainability 
activities are managed at a functional level across our 
strategic and operational areas, with executive and 
Board oversight.
Visa’s Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 
Leadership Council serves as the central coordinating 
body facilitating our corporate responsibility and 
sustainability strategy and reporting efforts. The 
Leadership Council is co-chaired by our Vice  
President — Head of Corporate Responsibility and 
Sustainability and our Chief Counsel — Corporate,  
with cross-functional representation from more than  
a dozen senior leaders. The Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee of the Board has formal 
responsibility for and oversight of corporate responsibility 
and sustainability policies, programs and reporting. 
For more information on governance of corporate 
responsibility and sustainability at Visa, please see  
page 8 of our 2018 Corporate Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report.
Stakeholder Engagement 
Understanding the views and concerns of Visa 
stakeholders supports our work across our business 
and corporate responsibility strategic priorities. We 
regularly engage our stakeholders in a variety of ways, 
including: employees (employee surveys, all-staff 
meetings), clients (client councils, payment forums), 
investors (shareholder earnings calls, direct 
engagement, SEC filings, investor conferences), and 
government and policy officials (participation as panelists 
at policy gatherings, Visa School of Public Policy, industry 
association memberships and participation).9  Corporate Recognition

Small & Micro Businesses
Visa works to drive economic growth and improve  
the livelihoods of millions by helping small and micro businesses (SMBs) thrive. Our services, products and programs enable businesses to do the following:
  Accept simple and secure electronic and card 
payments in person, online or over the phone.
  Manage cash flow with Visa Direct, Visa’s real-time* 
payment solution that makes earned funds readily available to payees.
  Avoid installing costly infrastructure by facilitating 
convenient and secure electronic payments using mobile phone-based scan-to-pay.
  Improve their customers’ checkout experience with 
convenient, fast and secure contactless payments.
  Reduce costs with business-relevant discounts from 
Visa SavingsEdge.  Grow their business with Visa Commerce Network’s 
card-linked offers and exclusive advertising benefits from partners.
In 2019 and early 2020, Visa continued our work to empower SMBs by:
  Introducing Visa Infinite Business, a product and service 
portfolio for fast-growing small businesses in the United States. Visa Infinite Business helps to address specific challenges and needs of small businesses  by offering services such as business protection, travel benefits and accounting software integration.
  Launching a $2.4 million, three-year partnership 
with Hand in Hand International, a global non-profit organization that focuses on developing economies in Africa and South Asia. Visa’s partnership with  Hand in Hand International will focus on providing business education and broadened financial services access to 10,000 micro businesses in Kenya — at least 75 percent of which are owned by women.  Collaborating with Côte d’Ivoire’s national 
government and local fintech Unitec to digitize payments for up to 5 million small merchants — with the goal of reaching one million merchants in the next three years. Visa’s contributions include technology solutions, capacity building and access to credit and insurance services. In addition, Visa is providing financial literacy training, reaching more than 9,000 individuals in 2019.
  Launching Practical Business Skills, Visa's educational 
portal for small business owners in the United States, in English and Spanish. In the first five months after the launch, more than 7,000 unique visitors accessed the portal to view more than 40 educational modules and tools supporting day-to-day activities. With regular updates to the portal planned, including new content and customizable business templates, we plan to launch the portal in four languages globally in 2020.
* A ctual fund availability varies by receiving financial institution, receiving 
account type, region, and whether transaction is domestic or cross-border.  
Visa requires U.S. issuers to make funds available to its cardholders within a 
maximum of 30 minutes of approving the transaction.Women-Owned SMBs
Many of Visa's SMB initiatives focus on empowering 
women. Despite their significant economic contributions, many women-owned SMBs are financially underserved. Financial products such as savings, credit and insurance can help low-income women build their assets, grow their businesses and ensure economic resilience in challenging times. When women-owned SMBs thrive, their owners can reinvest in their families and communities, creating a ripple effect of long-term, intergenerational change, including investments in education, housing and healthcare.
In 2019, Visa aimed to advance women’s 
empowerment by:
  Launching She’s Next, Empowered by Visa, a global 
initiative that champions women in their efforts to run, fund and grow small businesses. In its first year, the initiative hosted 10 workshops where hundreds of female entrepreneurs assembled to discuss  brand building, money management, payments technology and the fundamentals of leadership.  In addition, we reached more than 6,000 women entrepreneurs through workshops, events and partnership with the Female Founder Collective.  Partnering with the International Trade Center to 
find solutions to overcome cultural, regulatory and financial impediments to the success of women-led enterprises and enable their integration into global trade. This work aims to help advance ITC’s objective of connecting 3 million women to international markets by 2021.
  Inviting organizations with at least one female 
founder to submit solutions tackling business  and social challenges during the first-ever Visa Everywhere Initiative (VEI) — Women’s Global Edition. Selected participants benefited from increased exposure, partnerships with other entrepreneurs, mentorship and support from  Visa. In addition, the two winners received  $100,000 each.
  Launching the Olympic Games and Women 
program in collaboration with the China Women's Development Foundation and Beijing Sport University to empower women-led small and micro businesses to participate in and benefit from the economic opportunity of the Beijing 2022 Olympics and Paralympic Winter Games. The program provides a diverse capacity building mechanism  as well as a knowledge sharing and networking platform for women to connect and learn from  each other. The goal is to support more than 5,000 women-led small businesses by 2022.
Money Is Changing
In 2019, we continued our social media and digital series, Money is Changing, which facilitates conversations among women on how to more effectively earn and manage money.
1314Unbanked &  
Underserved Individuals
Around the world, an estimated 1.7 billion people 
remain excluded from the formal financial system and from the tools and services that help them manage cash flow, save for life goals and manage unexpected life events. Through expanding digital payments account access, Visa has the opportunity to advance financial inclusion, improve the lives of millions of people and strengthen economies around the world.
In 2015, Visa committed to provide 500 million 
previously unbanked or underserved people with access to a Visa branded payment account by 2020,  in support of the World Bank’s goal of Universal Financial Access. We met this goal in 2019.
Examples of Visa’s 2019 contributions to empowering 
individuals include:
  Expanding the capabilities of Visa Direct to facilitate 
safe and quick remittance payments across borders.
  Partnering with Branch, to help shape the future of 
microfinance around the world. Our partnership with Branch will enable unbanked individuals to receive credit at any physical ATM using their mobile phone.
  Building on secure commerce collaborations  
with Rappi, an on-demand delivery startup, to accelerate digital commerce and financial inclusion across Latin America and the Caribbean. The multi-year agreement with Rappi will benefit merchants and consumers by eliminating cash  from small transactions.  Announcing a partnership with Gojek, an 
Indonesian-based, multiservice technology platform, to help SMBs in Indonesia build an online presence and grow their business. We are exploring ways to use the combined Gojek and Visa networks to expand financial access in Southeast Asia.
  Investing $3 million in Accion Venture Lab (AVL),  
a financial inclusion-focused venture capital fund investing in early stage fintech companies that target underserved consumers and small businesses. Visa remains active as a Limited Partner, engaging the Fund’s managers and select investees.  Co-designing and helping to fund the  
Inclusive Fintech 50 competition. Through this competition, judges selected and recognized  50 winners — companies that are offering  high-potential products and business models for meeting the needs of underserved communities.
  Supporting the South African government in 
disbursing social grants to 8 million beneficiaries  on a monthly basis — a successful public-private partnership that benefits citizens, and supports  the government’s objectives of achieving security, efficiency and transparency in governance.

Financial Literacy
Visa is proud to provide free and accessible financial 
education to help people better manage their money. In 2019, we continued to offer our flagship program, Practical Money Skills, which provides individuals with free financial literacy tools and resources for every stage of their lives. Notable 2019 highlights include:
  Dominican Republic:  In partnership with the  
Central Bank and the vice president of the Dominican Republic, Visa introduced our Professor  Q financial literacy theatre program to more  than 2,300 local students.
  China: Through events like Visa’s Financial Literacy Summit and Carnival we reached approximately 30,000 students directly and millions more through media outreach.
  Turkey: Through Visa’s I Can Manage My Money financial education program, we delivered trainings to more than 1.6 million people in 81 cities since the program launched in 2009. A further 300,000 people actively engaged with the program via social media.

Report, pages 16–17.

their dreams both on and off the field. We underscore our commitment to champion economic empowerment through our efforts to empower women at the intersection of business and athletics. In 2019, we elevated women in sport by:
Acting as the official payment services partner of the FIFA  
Women’s World Cup France 2019.
Our support of this global event included sponsorship of 18 Team Visa athletes 
competing from 16 countries. The partnership highlighted Visa’s message that ‘One Moment Can Change the Game’ and focused on our support of women entrepreneurs, cardholders, small business owners and athletes, as well as our commitment to diversity and inclusion.
Announcing a five-year sponsorship agreement with  
the U.S. Soccer Federation.
Visa’s sponsorship contributes to a long-standing investment in the 
development of women’s soccer and the U.S. Women’s National Team through 2023. In early 2020, Visa was the presenting sponsor of the SheBelieves Cup, a four-team women’s international tournament played in the United States each year. Through this partnership, we used the global Visa platform to help inspire women athletes, advance the game and develop the next generation of female leaders, both in athletics and in business.Giving Highlights*

As a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Visa 
Foundation seeks to support inclusive economies where individuals, businesses and communities can thrive. Through grantmaking and investing, the Visa Foundation prioritizes the resilience and growth of small and micro businesses that benefit women. In 2019, the Visa Foundation supported communities by: 
  Partnering with the Aspen Network of 
Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to launch the ANDE Gender Equality Initiative, which aims to advance gender equality in emerging markets. As part of  the Initiative, ANDE is distributing $1 million in funding over two years to entrepreneurial support organizations in South and  Southeast Asia.
  Continuing a five-year, $20 million partnership 
with Women’s World Banking to support women-owned SMBs around the world. At the end of its third year, the partnership has reached more than 100,000 women entrepreneurs. Please see the Empowering Women section of this report for more information on Visa’s efforts to support women entrepreneurs. 
  Fighting poverty and homelessness in  
Visa’s headquarters community by donating $3 million to Tipping Point Community  for economic opportunities in vulnerable communities, and $1.5 million to the University of California San Francisco to support mental health programs for at-risk youth and chronically homeless populations.Community Support
At Visa, we use our time, talent and resources to strengthen the communities and markets in which we operate. Our approach to community support includes:
 Community Giving
 Employee Community Involvement
 Humanitarian and Disaster Relief
In 2019, Visa Inc.’s and the Visa Foundation’s giving totaled more than $23.5 million.
Community Giving
In 2019, Visa Inc. gave a total of $4.7 million in charitable contributions to more than 300 organizations in 28 countries around the world. We focused our giving efforts on the needs most relevant to the communities in which we live, work and do business. The underlying themes of our 2019 giving include access to education, support for vulnerable populations, hunger relief and promotion of good health.
Our community giving 
efforts in 2019 focused  on opening access to education, supporting vulnerable populations, hunger relief and promoting good health.Employee Giving
Our employees can help select the causes that Visa 
supports. In the Asia-Pacific region, employees have the opportunity to nominate local charities for a $10,000 grant, with 10 grants available annually. Local Visa team members then organize volunteering events with the winning charities. One of the 2019 winners was the Geoje Somang Welfare Organization (GSWO) in South Korea, a nonprofit that provides long-term skills and training for people with physical and mental disabilities. With the grant from Visa, GSWO purchased medical equipment, expanded its small farm and developed its own brand of organic eggs. Visa volunteers helped GWSO register as an e-commerce merchant and build a marketing, partnership management and operational plan to access a wider market.
18In 2019, 3,800 employees donated $4.2 million to over 
4,700 charities around the world, which was matched by Visa. In addition, 3,800 employees reported volunteering almost 40,000 hours for over 800 charities.
Employee Involvement
We complement our corporate contributions by 
empowering employees around the world to give to their communities through donations of time, talent and funds. We encourage our employees to support causes important to them through various mechanisms, including:
  Matching Gifts: Visa matches employees’ personal donations 1:1 up to US $10,000 per year; we also offer additional 2:1 matching opportunities during major disasters and other significant events.
  Dollars for Doers: employees can earn $10 per hour spent volunteering, up to $500 per year, to contribute to the charities they support.
  Volunteer Time Off (VTO): we provide up to two days VTO per eligible employee per year.
  Team Volunteer Events: we organize and fund team volunteering opportunities.
  Employee Volunteer Councils:  we support Councils 
around the world that facilitate our programs at the local level while providing leadership development opportunities for employees.Humanitarian & Disaster Relief
We contribute our resources and unique capabilities  in partnerships with governments, international relief organizations and private organizations to help communities in crisis. Following major natural disasters around the globe, Visa and the Visa Foundation provide financial donations to humanitarian efforts. Visa also offers double-matching of employee donations to humanitarian organizations. When it  is safe to do so, employees volunteer their time to relief efforts, such as by packing food and supplies  for impacted populations.
In addition, Visa’s Back to Business website uses  
our unique data capabilities to help consumers  find small businesses that meet their post-disaster needs and, at the same time, support impacted  small businesses, thus helping accelerate economic recovery for the community.
In 2019, Visa and the Visa Foundation gave over $2.3 
million in relief donations following disasters such  as Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, Cyclone Fani in India  and Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas.
Employee Generosity  
Shines on #GivingTuesday
In November 2019, Visa participated in the annual #GivingTuesday global event by  offering double matching of employees’ charitable donations. More than 2,600 employees participated on that day and,  with Visa's match, more than $4.5 million was donated to 2,700 organizations around the globe. With their generosity and commitment, Visa employees proved that together, we are  a strong force for good. 19Securing 
Commerce 
& Protecting 
Customers 
At Visa, we are committed to connecting and 
protecting the digital payments system and  
its users through a multi-layered approach.20
Payments Security
At Visa, we invest in innovation to build and maintain 
trust across our network and the broader payments ecosystem. As payment volumes significantly increase, we continue to evolve our security capabilities and lower our global fraud rate. 
We recently updated our security strategy to address 
more holistically the needs of the consumer. The new Intelligent Security narrative delivers seamless and secure experiences to our customers through the entire consumer experience. Deliver Seamless, Secure Experiences
Our end-to-end lifecycle transaction services include:
1. Account Onboarding & Management 
Recognizing fraudulent account activity (e.g., 
opening or accessing) through sophisticated 
analytics and risk tools 
2. Consumer Identity & Authentication 
Enabling seamless, data-led authentication to 
confirm consumers are who they say they are
3. Transaction Authorization 
Optimizing authorizations through  
sophisticated data analytics that  
minimize fraudulent transactions 
4. Dispute Management 
Facilitating logic-based, streamlined dispute 
management and resolution5. Performance Optimization  
Enhancing payment performance through 
tailored expertise and benchmark data21
Account Onboarding  
& Management
Visa’s payments security strategy starts from the 
moment a consumer signs up for a credit or debit account with a financial institution (FI). Through our FI clients, Visa provides consumer tools for greater individual control of personal assets. With these tools, consumers can manage their account security settings, including establishing restrictions on account use and customizing account alerts.
Consumer Identity 
& Authentication
Our robust authentication strategies work to verify  
that the user of an account is the rightful owner. For example, we use an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered platform to analyze thousands of behavioral signals, including information from two-step authentication,  to evaluate the trustworthiness of each attempted login to a Visa account.
In fiscal year 2019, we issued 410 million tokens and 
continued the implementation of our Visa Token Service (VTS), which is now operating in 100 markets. Our VTS technology works by replacing a consumer’s card-related sensitive information, such as personal account number, with a unique identifier, or token, when a card or shopper is not physically present.Transaction Authorization
We aim to prevent fraud before it happens without inconveniencing the consumer. Our Visa Advanced Authorization (VAA) tool uses real-time AI and machine learning to evaluate the trustworthiness of transactions. Today, more than 8,000 issuers in 129 countries receive VAA scores to help reduce fraudulent transactions. Over the past 12 months alone we helped financial institutions prevent an estimated $25 billion in fraud using our AI-powered risk scoring engine.
Dispute Management 
We help consumers and issuers to proactively address transaction disputes through Visa tools such as Verifi, which provides issuers and customers access to transaction information from sellers via a global data-sharing network. 
Performance Optimization 
An important piece of the Visa Intelligent Security strategy is our commitment to enhancing payment 
performance  — b y reducing fraud and increasing 
efficiency — through tools such as the Visa Analytics Platform. Financial institutions, issuers, acquirers and co-brand merchants can utilize the Platform to access three years of Visa debit, credit and prepaid data across their Visa portfolio to help analyze performance at the cardholder, merchant and transaction levels.

to Payments Security, see Visa’s 2018 Corporate 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report, pages 21–22. 
2122Cybersecurity at Visa
Visa is committed to championing cybersecurity 
within our operations in parallel with helping advance the security of the broader payments ecosystem. Our cybersecurity team comprises professionals located in 11 offices on three continents and operates with 24x7x365 vigilance to detect, prevent and respond to threats in real-time. Across Visa, we have approximately 800 employees dedicated to cybersecurity efforts, representing roughly five percent of our workforce. In 2019, we spent hundreds of millions of dollars  on cybersecurity, covering investments in core components of our holistic approach:
Strategy
Visa deploys state-of-the-art security technologies  to protect against data confidentiality, integrity  and availability risks, emphasizing core cybersecurity capabilities to minimize risk exposure. We  are continuously focused on enhancing our  defense-in-depth security approach, which applies multiple layers of protection to reduce the risk of any single control failing. To keep pace with emerging technology trends, we are defining and advancing our Security Long Term Architecture (SLTA) to align with Zero Trust model principles that organizations should not automatically trust anything internal or external to its boundaries, and require verification of everything trying to connect to a system before granting access.
Policy
Visa’s cybersecurity policy, the Key Controls, provides a strong foundation for protection of our information assets and consumer nonpublic personal information.Audit
We conduct annual internal and external audits of our IT infrastructure and applications to evaluate performance against industry standards.
Technical Controls
Visa uses artificial intelligence and deep learning technology to monitor our network and understand the threats aimed at our company. Our platform collects billions of security logs each day, providing insight across the network and within our infrastructure. We combine this data with external intelligence on attacks observed outside of our data centers and network.
Training
We require regular security awareness training for our employees and contingent workers.Response & Resilience
We complement our advanced defensive capabilities — which include monitoring, detection, response, intelligence and investigation — with internal processes and policies designed to ensure resiliency in the event of a cyberattack. We regularly conduct cross-functional exercises that involve multiple internal response and recovery teams as well as external partners and agencies.
Collaboration
We are expanding our global capabilities, through Visa’s Cyber Fusion Framework, for rapidly collecting, analyzing and using cyber-threat intelligence. In 2019, we opened a new Cyber Fusion Center in Singapore.
For more details on our management approach to 
Cybersecurity, see Visa’s 2018 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report, pages 23–24. Visa continues to receive the highest rating among  
peer companies for cybersecurity maturity from  Gartner Consulting.
23Consumer Privacy
Respect for consumer privacy is central to Visa’s 
mission. Over the past several years, Visa has developed a Global Privacy Program rooted in our long-standing commitment to protect consumer data and maintain consumer confidence in our business. Our Program enables compliance in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment.
Our Global Privacy Office, led by Visa’s Chief 
Privacy Officer, closely coordinates with several cross-functional governance bodies. The Corporate Risk Committee and the Visa Board’s Audit and Risk Committee oversee the Global Privacy Program and the risks related to data privacy, including our compliance with current and emerging data protection laws around the world. 
Visa adheres to the applicable legal and security 
standards in all markets where we operate—a commitment backed by regular assessments, testing and auditing as appropriate or required to ensure ongoing compliance. The Visa Data Use Council (VDUC), composed of senior leaders from across functions and chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer, reviews and advises on new products and services that use personal information. The Data Council, created in 2019 and led by the Global Head of Data Products, is charged with defining a broader strategic vision for Visa’s data-related businesses, and prioritizing data-related technology and infrastructure investments. In 2019, Visa worked extensively to prepare for the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The CCPA — enacted in 2018 — went into effect on January 1, 2020, and expanded the privacy rights of California residents by imposing new requirements and restrictions on businesses that collect their personal information. To comply, Visa implemented new processes and controls to address the law’s unique standards, including: 
  Redesigning our Visa Privacy Center and updating 
our privacy notices to offer consumers clear, easy-to-understand information about Visa’s collection and use of personal information, as well as establishing new pathways for consumers to exercise applicable privacy-related rights and choices;
  Expanding our Data Subject Rights program  
to support requests for certain personal information—such as for contact information collected for marketing purposes—from California residents and other United States consumers, and investing in technologies that will 
further streamline request fulfillment  in the future; 
  Amending agreements, as necessary, to ensure  
that any third party with which we share personal information is vetted and subject to suitable contractual restrictions; and
  Enhancing transparency and cookie consent 
management processes for visitors to Visa websites.
We require all Visa employees globally to complete annual compliance training, including training on our Global Privacy Policy and Visa’s Key Controls. In 2019, we also rolled out training on responsible data use specifically developed for key product and development groups across our company.
24
Transaction Integrity
Visa is committed to ensuring the integrity of our 
payment system to maintain and enhance trust in Visa as the most secure way to pay. 
Visa’s Global Brand Protection Program manages 
situations where the Visa brand is associated with illegal activities. These include transactions such as:
 Illegal Internet gambling; 
 Illicit pharmaceutical sales; 
 Child abuse images and;
 Abuse of intellectual property rights. 
As part of this program, Visa continued the following in 2019:
  Supporting the U.S. Financial Coalition Against Child 
Exploitation, which is sponsored and managed by the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children and the U.S. based National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. 
  Membership and partnership with the International 
Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC). In 2019, the IACC recognized Visa with an award for our continued support of the IACC’s mission.
  Working with acquiring banks to proactively identify 
and terminate merchants that are selling illegal items and services. 
  Providing machine-learning solutions to acquirers to 
identify merchants that are laundering transactions for hidden illegal activity.25Investing in  
Our Workforce 
The talent, diversity and dedication of our 
employees supports Visa’s work toward our mission 
to connect the world to enable businesses, 
economies and individuals to thrive. At Visa, we celebrate our employees’ unique life experiences, 
talents, passions and the contributions they can 
make to drive innovation in the payments technology industry.26
Employee Learning  
& Development 
Learning and development are critical components  
of Visa’s commitment to investing in our employees. The Visa Learning organization focuses on developing our current and future workforces through educational programs in areas such as payments, diversity and inclusion, and leadership. In 2019, 96 percent of  Visa employees worldwide engaged in optional learning activities.
We continue to use Visa University to equip our 
employees with the appropriate knowledge and  skills to shape the future of commerce. Visa University comprises a team of learning and development professionals, physical campuses in Foster City and Singapore, and a global digital campus. Together, Visa University offers more than 80,000 learning resources to our employees anytime, anywhere.Visa Learning Festival
In 2019, Visa hosted our first-ever global Visa Learning Festival, with an inaugural focus on curiosity. The event provided Visa employees with opportunities to explore their interests, inspire new ideas and spark collaboration. During the interactive three-day event, participants heard from Visa experts, renowned authors, industry leaders and innovators, all sharing  
how curiosity led to their own personal and professional breakthroughs. More than 70 events took place over three days at Visa offices in 11 countries. Over 3,000 people attended the festival live or virtually, resulting in more than 10,000 hours of learning by all attendees.
27
Developing the Future Workforce 
At Visa, we hold a longstanding commitment to 
cultivate an educated and skilled workforce. In support of our commitment, Visa was one of more than 350 companies and organizations to sign the Pledge to America’s Workers in 2018. The pledge promises to expand programs designed to educate, train and reskill more than 14.3 million students and workers. As part of our commitment, over the next five years Visa pledges to enhance career opportunities for 14,500 individuals, both within and outside of Visa’s workforce, including through apprenticeships and work-based learning programs, continuing education, on-the-job training and reskilling.
As part of the pledge, in 2019 we announced the 
launch of the Visa Certification Program, designed to train dispute resolution professionals — a role in high demand by financial institutions. The Program offers  a less time-consuming and lower-cost alternative  to a traditional degree, helping enable candidates  to develop the skills and experiences needed for a successful career in dispute resolution. To support access to the certification program, Visa created a  fund to provide 500 individuals with scholarships. In the summer of 2019, we hosted nearly 350 full-time interns with the goal of offering high performers Visa employment upon graduation. In addition, Visa conducts a “Ready to Return” program, which helps job seekers who are looking to return to work after taking time off due to life circumstances or family care needs. In 2019, we received more than 1,600 applications for program participation, and hundreds attended our one-day event in San Francisco.
As a further component of our commitment to 
develop the future workforce, in early 2019, Visa Chairman and CEO Al Kelly joined the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, a 25-member advisory committee led by the White House and the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Board is advising the U.S. government on ways the private sector and educational institutions can collaborate to prepare  the current and future workforce to fill jobs demanding increasing levels of digital skills.
For more details on our approach to employee 
learning and development, see Visa’s 2018 Corporate 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report, page 27. Employee Engagement 
At Visa, we believe building an actively engaged workforce is good for our employees and for our business alike. Throughout the year we engage with our employees through content on Visa’s intranet, digital signage, live events in offices, quarterly all-staff meetings and other ways. 
Our Annual Employee Survey empowers employees  
to provide feedback on a variety of experiences, and the results help Visa people leaders gain insight into the most important drivers of and current state of engagement for our workforce. In 2019, 95 percent  of employees responded to the survey, with scores increasing on 19 of the questions and no scores notably declining. Dimensions with the largest increases were Engagement, Collaboration, Rewards and Recognition and Tools and Processes. In response to this employee feedback, we continue to optimize the employee experience, including through our most recent focus on process efficiency. Following the survey, Visa people leaders are encouraged to discuss the results with their teams and identify opportunities for improvement. In addition, Visa’s Simplify Work and Tools (SWAT) initiative aims to improve global tools, processes and policies at Visa and implement changes that enhance employee experiences across all offices and functions.

2015 2016 2017 2018 2019
89% 94% 94% 95% 95%Inclusion & Diversity 
At Visa, we foster an inclusive workplace to encourage 
diversity of thought, culture and background. We work to enable employees to bring their whole selves to work, creating an environment where diverse perspectives are voiced and heard. Through investments in inclusion and diversity training and a dedication to building a diverse talent pipeline, Visa helps foster the growth and development of all employees. We also collaborate across Visa to address important challenges (e.g., equal pay and minority representation) and work to address unconscious biases.
To help build an inclusive workplace, the Inclusion & 
Diversity College at Visa University offers a specialized curriculum and resources to help employees understand how diversity impacts the workplace. Between August 2018 and March 2019, 94 percent of our people managers completed the Visa Inclusive Leadership Training, and we anticipate achieving 100 percent completion by end of fiscal year 2020. To maintain an inclusive workplace, all new managers  
will be expected to undergo the Inclusive Leadership Training within a year of entering the role.
In 2019, we also continued our leadership development 
programs for diverse employees, including:
  Elevate: an in-house program designed to advance 
African American/Black and Hispanic/Latinx employees at Visa. Elevate provides insights and strategies for career advancement, exposure and access to senior leaders and a platform to obtain feedback. Since its launch in 2017, more than 180 employees from across our U.S. offices have completed the program.  Executive Edge: a global leadership program 
designed for women and developed in partnership with UC Berkeley Haas School of Business. Executive Edge invests in the upward trajectory of key talent within our organization and helps retain women in leadership roles at Visa. More than 100 women have completed Executive Edge since its launch in 2016. Female representation at the global executive leadership level at Visa increased from 30 percent at the end of fiscal year 2017 to 33 percent at the end of fiscal year 2019.
To further support gender equality efforts, we collaborate with organizations such as Catalyst, Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley — organizations that provide Visa with information on equality best practices, industry benchmarking, the latest academic research and thought partnership. In 2019, Visa Chairman and CEO Al Kelly joined the Board of Directors of Catalyst, a non-profit conducting research to better understand how to promote gender equality and inclusion in  the workplace. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with Catalyst and other organizations to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
In 2019, to celebrate diversity, Visa signed the Business 
Statement for TransEquality during Pride month  to solidify our support of legal protections for transgender people. The statement calls for transparency in policy-making, equality under the  law and for the treatment of all people with the respect and dignity they deserve.Our commitment to diversity and inclusion extends to the world of sport. In 2019, as the Official Payments Services Partner and a Gold Partner to the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic Games, Visa signed 11 Paralympic athletes to our Team Visa program for Tokyo 2020. The program supports the athletes by providing tools and resources necessary to pursue their personal and professional goals. Visa also is supporting the Japanese Paralympic Committee’s launch of a donation-matching program for Visa cardholders in Japan.
Visa also offers programs and campaigns that support 
female athletes, as well as help build women’s financial literacy and support female entrepreneurs. For more information about these programs, see the Empowering People and Economies chapter of this report.

§Leadership: Defined as VP and above30Employee Benefits
Our employees are our most important asset, and we 
continue to add to and evolve our programs to attract 
and retain a talented and engaged workforce. We are 
proud that in 2019, 86 percent of our employees 
favorably rated Visa’s employee benefits, compared to  
83 percent in 2018.
Health
Visa continues to offer health benefits with diverse 
programs that meet a variety of employee needs. In 
2019, we began offering United States employees free 
access to an online wellness coaching service, which 
helps create and pursue goals for a healthy lifestyle, 
chronic condition management and emotional health.
In support of our transgender employees, we continue 
enhancing our U.S.-based medical coverage with 
additional services. These new offerings include health 
plan coverage, navigation, education and support. 
Financial 
Visa's financial support to employees includes a base 
salary, a commitment to paying a fair living wage, 
benefits and employee services. In 2019, Visa 
continued to expand our employee stock purchase 
plan (ESPP) program. The program enables employees 
to contribute 1–10 percent of eligible compensation 
toward the purchase of Visa stock at a 15 percent 
discount. The program applies to full- and part-time 
employees who work at least 20 hours per week in 34 
countries; 97 percent of our employees worldwide are 
eligible to participate.In early 2018, Visa increased our 401(k) match for 
participants in the U.S. We now contribute $2 for every 
$1 our employees contribute, up to 5 percent of base 
pay, for a total of 10 percent. All regular U.S. employees, 
except Executive Committee members, are eligible for 
the increased 401(k) match.
Life 
We aim to support our employees in the moments 
that matter. In 2019, we implemented programs in the 
United States to support new parents, including 
lactation support and free milk shipping for nursing 
mothers who are traveling.
Visa fosters an inclusive culture that supports flexible 
work in a way that ensures both positive employee 
and company outcomes. Flexible work arrangements 
(FWA) are determined on an individual basis and 
include options such as alternative work hours, 
telecommuting and part-time schedules. 
Benefits Outside the U.S. 
We regularly benchmark our international benefit 
offerings against those of our peers and best practices, 
and expand Visa programs where appropriate. For 
example, in 2019, after our annual benchmark, we 
implemented a new retirement program for nearly 
1,000 Visa employees based in the Philippines. We  
also focus on clearly communicating benefit options 
to Visa employees globally to best connect people 
with the services they need.
For more information about Visa’s Employee Benefits 
programs, please see our 2018 Corporate Responsibility 
& Sustainability Report,  pages 26–29. Employee Safety 
The Visa Global Security and Safety (GSS) team is 
responsible for establishing health and safety practices 
and safeguarding company facilities. The GSS team 
maintains a global Safety, Health and Environmental 
policy and provides trainings to executives and key 
employees on several aspects of the policy. To further 
protect our employees, Visa assesses and manages 
risks to best provide security, emergency response and 
safety management in support of our employees 
around the globe. Our GSS team proactively prepares 
for action by monitoring: 
  Emerging security threats such as natural disasters, 
civil unrest and terrorist attacks identified through 
security, government and media sources 
  Personnel on business travel and employees who 
are working outside their home countries 
  Company assets including facilities and strategic 
third-party sites
In recognition of our safety efforts, Visa’s European 
initiatives received the Royal Society for the Prevention  
of Accidents (RoSPA) Gold Award in 2019. The award 
recognizes companies that strongly demonstrate health 
management systems and culture, as well as outstanding 
control of risk and low levels of error, harm and loss. 31Protecting  
the Planet
As we use our electronic payments network  
to connect consumers, financial institutions, 
merchants and governments around the world, 
we recognize the importance of understanding 
and minimizing the environmental footprint of 
our business and taking urgent climate action. 32
Within Visa 
Our Focus Areas 
We organize our approach to managing environmental impacts within Visa into three 
focus areas: facilities, operations and employees. Considering these areas and how they interconnect allows Visa to develop sustainability initiatives for different aspects  of our business. 
Facilities 
The responsible use of natural resources in the operation of Visa offices and data centers is a foundational part of our efforts to protect the planet. Visa’s footprint includes 19,500 employees in more than 130 office and data center locations around the world. We are committed to reducing our environmental impact at our facilities and data centers by focusing on green building design and operation, obtaining  LEED or equivalent certifications for our buildings and increasing resource use efficiency. At the end of 2019, approximately 66 percent of Visa’s owned or leased square footage, occupied by 63 percent of our employees, achieved or was pending LEED, BREEAM, Green Mark or other green-building certification. Looking forward,  we are using high green building standards as we construct or renovate several large Visa offices in 2020 and beyond.Visa Environmental Sustainability

100% Renewable Electricity
In 2018, Visa set a goal to transition to the purchasing of 100 percent renewable 
electricity by 2020, and in January 2020, we announced our achievement of  
that goal. To reach this milestone, we worked with local utilities and competitive 
electricity providers to select the renewable electricity options that best fit  
the needs of each Visa office. By purchasing 100 percent renewable electricity, 
Visa mitigates the greenhouse gas emissions from purchased electricity 
consumption, also known as Scope 2 emissions, by nearly 90 percent versus  
our 2014 baseline.
As part of our commitment to support the renewable electricity movement 
more broadly, Visa has been a member of the Renewable Energy Buyers 
Alliance and the RE100 since 2018. The RE100, led by The Climate Group in 
partnership with CDP , is a global corporate leadership initiative bringing 
together businesses that commit to use 100 percent renewable electricity.Operations
In addition to addressing the environmental impact from our facilities, we take a 
proactive approach to reducing the environmental footprint from Visa’s business 
activities, which include purchased goods and services, corporate travel, food services 
and events. 
  Since the goods and services we obtain and use through our global procurement 
activities are a significant component of our emissions, in 2019 we joined the CDP 
Supply Chain Program to collect accurate and regular climate change and carbon 
information from our key suppliers. We use the information gathered through the 
supplier questionnaires to identify areas for improvement and opportunities for 
partnership on emissions reduction strategies. 
  Corporate travel is a contributor to our environmental footprint. In response, we 
continue to develop initiatives to provide and promote green travel choices to 
employees, such as highlighting options for travel by train. 
  We continue to bring additional sustainable food options to the offices where we 
offer food service, such as sourcing sustainable and local ingredients as well as 
following the Monterey Bay Aquarium Sustainable Seafood Recommendations. Our 
Waste Not program is designed to encourage proper composting of food waste. 
  Visa hosts a number of events for our clients and internal employee teams 
throughout the year. We created the Greening Our Events initiative to help reduce 
the food- and travel-related footprints of these events. Our Green Meeting Guide 
includes recommendations on sustainable catering options and tips on how to 
host zero waste events.
Employees 
We are committed to empowering our 19,500 employees around the world to be 
sustainability stewards in the workplace, at home and in our communities. In 2019, 
we continued and expanded our employee sustainability engagement initiatives in 
response to expressed interest in our global employee green survey, including 
managing Employee Green Teams in 12 offices. Some of our initiatives include: 
  Electric Vehicle (EV) test-drive events designed to let Visa employees experience 
EVs; a majority of participants in one 2019 event indicated they were much more 
likely to purchase an EV following the experience
  Virtual Eco Challenges events aimed to engage employees in environmentally-focused 
commitments at home and in the office to support behavior change and increased 
awareness and engagement34Our Results 
Measuring & Reporting 
In 2008, the year of Visa’s initial public offering, we began conducting an annual global environmental footprint assessment. The assessment is conducted with support from a leading third-party environmental firm and measures our global energy usage, water usage, waste production, landfill diversion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Starting in 2019, we expanded our efforts to consider 
the climate impacts of our business across Visa’s value chain. The Scope 3 data we consider comprises emissions from relevant categories including business travel, employee commuting and global procurement activities. In 2019, we responded once again to the CDP Climate Change questionnaire, and we provide a summary of data submitted to CDP in this report. We also obtained independent verification of our energy and emissions data.
Energy & Carbon Emissions
While our energy-use footprint is smaller than that of more resource-intensive industries, we are committed to continuing to improve our energy efficiency and procuring clean energy when possible.
In 2019, while Visa’s addition of office space and 
employees associated with several acquisitions  slightly increased total energy use, our energy and emissions intensity continued to decline. The number of Visa-owned and leased facilities increased 18 percent, from 115 facilities in 2018 to 131 in 2019.  Total square footage of Visa facilities increased by 11 percent, from approximately 4,000,000 ft
2 in 2018 
to 4,500,000 ft2 in 2019. Our total number of 
employees increased by 15 percent, from 17,000 in 2018 to 19,500 in 2019. In fiscal year 2019, we used approximately 740,000 gigajoules (GJ) of energy from electricity, natural gas and other fuels. This represents a slight increase of 4 percent compared to 2018, which resulted from the continued expansion of our operations. Our energy intensity per square foot, a commonly used metric  that adjusts for growth, improved by 5 percent year-over-year, representing five consecutive years  of improvement. This energy use is reflected in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
Since 2009, we have used international standards  
such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council  for Sustainable Development to calculate and  report the GHG emissions associated primarily with our energy usage. In 2019, our Scopes 1 and 2  GHG emissions, measured in absolute terms with a  market-based approach, were 62,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO
2e). This represents  
a 1 percent decrease year-over-year from 2018 and  a 35 percent decrease from our 2009 baseline year.  This decrease in emissions was largely driven by green building design, energy efficiency programs and renewable electricity use.Since our 2009 baseline, Visa’s global office square footage has increased by 80 percent and our global employee population has grown by 207 percent. Our emissions intensity indicators have decreased as we have become more efficient and purchased renewable energy while growing our business.
Energy & Carbon Metrics: 
  Scope 1 and 2 emissions per employee: decreased 14 
percent vs 2018; decreased 79 percent vs 2009 baseline 
  Scope 1 and 2 emissions per square foot of space: 
decreased 11 percent vs 2018; decreased 64 percent 
vs 2009 baseline 
  Scope 1 and 2 emissions per dollar revenue: 
decreased 8 percent vs 2018; decreased 80 percent vs 2009 baseline
With our greatest energy use and associated GHG emissions originating from purchased electricity at our offices and data centers, we continue to invest in energy efficiency efforts at those facilities. Our emissions per transaction decreased by 12 percent compared to 2018. In 2019, examples of our energy-saving efforts included the installation of new roof membranes and air conditioner units which reduced energy usage, retrofitting LED lighting and upgrading lighting and HVAC controls.
35Water
Though our business is not water intensive, we recognize the importance of 
protecting water as a shared resource. To reduce our total water consumption  
at our offices and data centers, we focus on enhancing data collection, critically 
evaluating data and implementing efficiency efforts.
Globally, we used an estimated 55,200,000 gallons of potable water in 2019, with  
73 percent of use occurring in the United States and Canada, 14 percent in Europe 
and the remainder in the Philippines, Singapore and elsewhere. By facility type, 77 
percent of potable water usage occurred in our offices while 23 percent occurred  
in our data centers. 
Waste Reduction & Diversion 
Visa employees work to reduce the amount of office waste we dispose in landfills 
through waste reduction, recycling and composting efforts. Reducing waste streams 
at our facilities is a particular focus of our global Green Teams, which collaborate  
on methods to engage employees, increase recycling rates and incorporate more 
reusable and compostable materials in the office. While not a major producer of solid 
waste, we are proud of our ongoing reduction efforts and have increased our landfill 
diversion rate from 55 percent in 2015 to 57 percent in 2019.
Travel & Transportation 
Employee business travel and employee commuting contribute to our total GHG 
emissions. Visa continues to identify, enable and encourage more sustainable travel 
and commuting behavior among employees. The programs we offer include: 
  Shuttles: We offer employee shuttles between nearby public transit hubs and other 
offices at many of our facilities around the world. In 2019, we provided 292,000 rides 
and reduced emissions from employee commuting by an estimated 1,600 MTCO2e. 
  Public transit: We encourage employees to use public transportation by offering 
transit fare subsidies. 
  Virtual meetings: We provide and encourage the use of videoconferencing 
technology to reduce the need for business travel.
  EV chargers: In 2019, we offered employees access to more than 100 electric vehicle 
chargers across our offices and facilities.
Long-Term Climate Risks & Opportunities 
Between 2018 and 2019, Visa completed our first formal climate risk 
assessment in alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD). This process included: 
1.  The identification of Board and executive leadership-level governance  
of climate-related risks and opportunities 
2.  An impact mapping exercise to determine the risks, sectors, markets and 
geographic regions to consider in our scenario analysis 
3.  A scenario and risk rating criteria process to define the specific climate 
scenarios most relevant to Visa
4.  A risk screening and prioritization analysis to evaluate the business impacts 
across scenarios and future time horizons
5.  The analysis of results to develop recommendations and next steps
The analysis identified the climate related risks and opportunities directly and 
indirectly affecting Visa using two future climate scenarios: Business-as-Usual and 
2-Degree. The Business-as-Usual scenario considered a future where greenhouse 
gas emissions and, by extension, global temperatures continue rising at current 
rates. The 2-Degree scenario considered a low-emissions future in alignment 
with the Paris Climate Agreement goals to keep global temperatures from rising 
more than 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100. According to the 
assessment, the most relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for Visa are 
the direct impact on operations and workforce, the indirect impact on market 
and merchant availability from extreme weather, and the potential shift in 
consumer preferences with the transition towards low carbon products and 
services. We are using the results of the assessment to inform our key functions, 
including risk, strategy and government engagement.36Visa Environmental Impact: At a Glance

Ecosystem 
Our commitment to environmental sustainability 
extends beyond our direct operations to initiatives  
to help inspire and empower sustainable living in 
commerce and consumption. Visa’s initiatives geared 
toward the broader payments ecosystem include: 
Insights
We are committed to supporting efforts to understand 
the barriers to and drivers of sustainable living and to 
share the results with our partners. In 2019, Visa joined 
as a design partner for the Healthy and Sustainable 
Living Study  conducted by GlobeScan and supported 
by several other leading brands. The study, which 
surveyed 25,000 consumers across 25 countries with 
results shared in September 2019, explored consumer 
concerns and identified opportunities to support more 
sustainable lifestyles. Verticals 
Visa is working to support initiatives and bring 
solutions that advance sustainability in particular 
vertical sectors, such as the following:
Travel and Tourism
In 2019, Visa co-founded Travalyst, a global initiative  
by the Duke of Sussex focused on advancing 
sustainability in travel with a stated mission to help 
everyone explore our world in a way that protects 
both people and places, and secures a positive future 
for destinations and local communities for generations 
to come. Through Travalyst, we are working with 
partners to develop and promote solutions to help 
drive sustainable practices and consumer choices  
in areas such as supporting local communities, 
protecting wildlife, tackling climate change, protecting 
natural resources and alleviating over-tourism. 
Mobility 
In cities around the world, administrators and urban 
planners are testing new approaches to make 
transportation systems more environmentally 
sustainable and logistically efficient. Greenhouse  
gas emissions from transport are on track to double  
by 2050, and already passenger vehicles account  
for 70 percent of those emissions and 50 percent  
of urban air pollution. 
Our commitment to environmental sustainability extends 
beyond our direct operations to initiatives to help  
inspire and empower sustainable living in commerce  
and consumption.We believe that increasing multi-modal mobility, 
especially public transit and micro-mobility options,  
is important to reducing these climate and 
environmental impacts and that instituting highly 
efficient systems of fare payment and collection is  
one of the best ways to encourage ridership and  
boost mobility systems’ economic sustainability. In 
collaboration with cities, national governments and 
more than 100 other partners — including public and 
private urban mobility providers — Visa is helping 
transportation networks function more efficiently, 
creating a better door-to-door journey for riders. Our 
Global Urban Mobility team is enabling cities to charge 
and collect fares by delivering a seamless way to pay 
for travel that is fast, easy and secure. As of May 2020, 
we have worked with more than 280 cities around the 
world to implement contactless fares using debit, 
credit and prepaid solutions. In addition, the Visa 
Ready for Transit program provides transit agencies 
with access to over 100 technology providers and 
consultancies worldwide who can help the agencies 
shift their ticketing and fare collection systems to 
contactless solutions.
Movement 
Finally, we are committed to helping build the overall 
sustainable living movement. In 2019, Visa was one of 
the founding members of Brands for Good, an initiative 
of Sustainable Brands to harness the power of brands 
to make sustainable living more attractive, rewarding 
and attainable. Brands for Good is using the collective 
power of brand marketing and employee and 
consumer engagement to make actionable, 
sustainable practices more easily accessible. 
3839Operating 
Responsibly
At Visa, operating responsibly means we are 
committed to the highest level of ethics and 
integrity throughout our operations, supply 
chain and the communities in which we live, 
work and do business.40
Corporate Governance
Visa’s governance practices help promote long-term 
value and strong Board and management accountability 
to our shareholders, clients and other stakeholders. Our 
Board of Directors oversees and monitors important 
governance issues, including Board independence,  
Board composition and refreshment, executive and  
Board compensation, as well as succession planning.  
A snapshot of our directors is below. 
Board & Committee Structure
In 2019, we refreshed the structure of our Board, 
adding the Finance Committee and welcoming a new 
chair to the Audit and Risk Committee. Our current 
committees include Audit and Risk, Compensation, 
Finance, and Nominating and Corporate Governance. 
All four Board committees are composed solely of 
independent directors. Also in 2019, Ramon L. 
Laguarta joined the Visa Board as a director. Visa’s 11 member Board of Directors now consists of 10 
independent members and our Chief Executive Officer, 
who also serves as Chair of the Board. 
In response to market trends, in 2019 we reduced the 
number of outside Boards on which directors may serve 
from five to four. The Board also extended board service 
limits to cover all executive officers of publicly traded 
companies, in addition to CEOs, and reduced the limit 
from three to two for these directors. The Nominating 
and Corporate Governance Committee may grant 
exceptions to established limits on a case-by-case basis.To serve our shareholders, employees and  
customers, the Board periodically reviews and 
evaluates its internal leadership structure. In 2019,  
the Board unanimously elected Al Kelly as our 
Chairman, in addition to his position as Chief Executive 
Officer. In addition, the independent directors 
reaffirmed the Board’s commitment to independent 
Board leadership by unanimously electing John 
Lundgren as Lead Independent Director. In order  
to ensure independent leadership, the Board also 
developed a robust set of responsibilities for the  
Lead Independent Director role.
In 2019, Ramon L. Laguarta joined the Visa Board as  
a director. Visa’s 11 member Board of Directors now 
consists of 10 independent members and our Chief 
Executive Officer, who also serves as Chair of the Board. 41Board & Executive Compensation 
Programs & Philosophy
Visa recognizes that environmental, social and  
governance (ESG) practices are important elements  
of long-term corporate strategy and contribute to  
Visa being a sustainable and responsible corporate 
citizen. As part of our annual incentive plan, the 
Compensation Committee measures individual 
performance of Visa’s executive officers by reviewing 
their achievement of pre-established goals that further 
one or more of the company’s seven strategic pillars.  
A number of these individual goals promote and  
incorporate ESG factors, including diversity and 
inclusion, employee leadership and development, 
cybersecurity and data privacy and financial inclusion 
and access. In addition, we consider individual 
performance, tied to strategic pillars, when setting  
the value of the officers’ long-term equity award. 
Shareholder Engagement 
Our Board and management team value the opinions 
and feedback of our shareholders, and we are 
committed to proactive, ongoing engagement with 
our shareholders throughout the year. In 2019, in 
addition to regular interaction of our Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations 
team with investors, we engaged our top 50 investors, 
representing more than 60 percent of our outstanding 
Class A common stock. We also held in-person and 
telephonic meetings with 28 institutional shareholders 
representing approximately 39 percent of our 
outstanding Class A common stock.

Ethics & Compliance
Trust underlies everything we do at Visa. We maintain 
the trust of our stakeholders in part through instilling a culture of honesty and integrity, in which we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards and strive to continuously strengthen our ethics and compliance program. 
Our commitment to ethics and compliance is captured 
in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code), which applies to everyone working with or on behalf of Visa, including employees, contingent staff and the Board of Directors.
In 2019, we revised our Code to: 
  Provide additional details on the confidential 
investigation and resolution process we undertake 
after an individual raises a concern
  Clarify the definition of a “close personal relationship,” 
as well as required disclosures and reporting line prohibitions of such relationships
  Add language regarding state and local “pay-to-play” 
laws that govern employees’ political contributions
  Detail the zero-tolerance stance towards employee 
assistance of tax evasion by other parties 
All Visa employees and Board members are required to annually certify that they have received and will comply with the Code, disclose conflicts of interest and complete compliance training. Our Supplier Code of Conduct applies to all suppliers. For more information on the Supplier Code of Conduct, please see the Responsible Sourcing section.For the seventh consecutive year, Visa was named to the World’s Most Ethical Companies list by Ethisphere Institute in 2019 (subsequently named for the eighth year in early 2020). Also in 2019, Visa received the Best Compliance and Ethics Program (large cap) Award from Corporate Secretary for the second consecutive year. For more details on our ethics and compliance program, see Visa’s 2018 Corporate Responsibility & 
Sustainability report, pages 43–44.
Engaging with 
Governments 
Decisions made in the public sector have the potential 
to significantly affect Visa’s business, direction and growth. As such, Visa actively engages with governments and their representatives in order to contribute our expertise on issues facing the global electronic payments sector. Through this engagement, we seek to identify areas of shared value and opportunity between public sector goals and the expansion of electronic payments.
In addition to working with governments, Visa has 
established strategic partnerships with other entities, including the World Economic Forum (WEF). As part of our partnership with WEF, we are a member of its Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR). As an industry leader, this membership allows us to engage with policymakers and experts to co-design innovative policy frameworks on emerging technologies. In 2019, Visa sent our first-ever Fellow to the C4IR to provide expertise on digital payments, digital trade and cross-border data flows. We are proud of our continually expanding partnership with the WEF.We also provide training and outreach programs to governments and policymakers around the world through Visa University and through a partnership with the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Our outreach and training programs allow us to foster the exchange of ideas on legal and economic aspects of digital financial services. In 2019, we trained more than 224 participants through this Visa University program.
In addition, we continued the following practices in 2019:
  Engaging officials and policymakers at the federal, 
state and local levels in the United States and 
internationally to provide them with information on our business model and commitment to maintain best-in-class cybersecurity, as well as the innovations that enable access to financial services through government partnerships around the world. 
  Publishing our Annual Corporate Political 
Contributions Report, which lists all U.S. trade associations to which Visa pays annual membership dues that are $25,000 or more, and, if applicable, discloses the portion of such dues that are used for political contributions. 
  In the United States, disclosing all contributions 
made by Visa’s Political Action Committee (PAC), in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Election Commission.
We hold ourselves to the 
highest ethical standards and strive to continuously strengthen our ethics and compliance program.43
Centre for Sport  
& Human Rights
In 2019, Visa continued our role as a founding 
supporter and Advisory Council member of the Centre for Sport and Human Rights (“Centre”), an alliance of intergovernmental organizations, governments, sports bodies, athletes, sponsors, civil society groups and others. The Centre’s work in 2019 included facilitating collective action on specific human rights cases, building capacity in the sports ecosystem through new tools and training, enabling knowledge sharing, and expanding its focus on the human rights of children in sport. In 2020, the Centre refreshed its Mega-Sporting Event working group, of which Visa is a member.Human Rights
At Visa, we recognize our responsibility to respect, advance and maintain global human rights standards across our company, operations and supply chain.
Our approach to respecting human rights is informed 
by international frameworks, such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights* . Visa’s cross-function Human Rights Working Group (HRWG) oversees our overall approach, including our risk identification, mitigation and due diligence strategy.  
The HRWG — through the Corporate Responsibility  
and Sustainability team — shares progress with the  
Visa executive team and Board of Directors on a regular basis, with the Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee providing human rights oversight as part of its overarching environmental,  
social and governance (ESG) responsibility. 
We are committed to a triennial global review of human 
rights risks resulting from our operations, network, supply chain and partnerships/sponsorships. In early 2020, we began our most recent company-wide assessment. Informed by this risk and impact assessment, our human rights strategy focuses on four areas: 
An Employer 
We acknowledge and respect the human rights of each employee. Outlined primarily in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our employee focus includes protecting privacy, freedom of expression, freedom of association and maintaining a workplace safe from retaliation. For a list of policies that contribute to preventing human rights violations in the workplace, see the Operating Sustainably and Responsibly chapter of the 2018 report.A Purchaser Through the Visa Supplier Code of Conduct, we outline for our suppliers our expectations including respecting human rights. Read more about our supply chain management in the Responsible Sourcing section of this report.
An E-Payments Enabler 
We understand that financial crimes can support activities that contribute to human rights abuses. We are committed to partnering with organizations globally to prevent illicit activities in our network. Read more about our efforts in the Transaction Integrity section of this report.
A Business Partner and Sponsor 
We incorporate respect for human rights into the expectations of our partnerships and sponsorships, including issues at the intersection of sports and human rights. Read more about one specific example — the Centre for Sport and Human Rights — in the accompanying sidebar. 
*For a complete list of the international guidance frameworks we are 
guided by in our human rights commitments, see the Operating Sustainably and Responsibly chapter of our 2018 Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability report.
We recognize our 
responsibility to respect, 
advance and maintain global human rights standards across our company, operations and supply chain.44Responsible Sourcing
Beyond Visa operations, our commitment to operate 
responsibly and sustainably extends to our suppliers 
and business partners.
Through our global Supplier Code of Conduct,  we 
outline our expectations in areas including human 
rights, employment practices, environmental impact, 
supplier diversity, conflicts of interest and other  
areas of responsible business. Further, we expect our 
suppliers to champion these values in their own 
supply chains. After we developed the Visa Supplier 
Code of Conduct, we distributed the document to  
our suppliers. We send the Supplier Code to new 
suppliers during the onboarding process. Internally, we are refreshing our approach to  
supplier management. Part of this refresh includes 
incorporating supplier diversity  as weighted criteria  
in the supplier selection and renewal processes.  
We also are bolstering our methods of assessing  
and minimizing cybersecurity and privacy risks in  
our supply chain.
Supplier Diversity 
Visa recognizes that a supply chain composed of  
diverse suppliers promotes competition and quality 
from our vendors, drives innovation and helps us better 
reflect the diversity of our customers. We are proud to 
work with a range of diverse suppliers, including 
Minority-owned businesses; Women-owned businesses; 
Disabled-owned businesses; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender-owned (LGBT) businesses; Disabled 
Veteran-owned businesses; Small, Certified HUBZone businesses; and Small businesses. In 2019, we continued 
implementation of our Supplier Code through:
  Developing Supplier Code of Conduct onboarding 
procedures to ensure consistency across all regions
  Updating our Global Master Services Agreement 
template to reflect the Code
  Updating our Request for Proposal Templates  
to include supplier diversity language and  
weighted scoring
  Updating our Global Sourcing Policy to reference 
the Supplier Code of Conduct
  Training our Global Sourcing team on the Supplier 
Code of Conduct’s principles and implementation
