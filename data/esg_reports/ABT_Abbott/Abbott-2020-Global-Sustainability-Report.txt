TABLE OF CONTENTS
COVER STORY: LAMIAH TYSINGER
When she was in high school, LaMiah Tysinger developed an 
interest in engineering and set her mind to learning all she could 
about a potential STEM career. She joined Abbott as a high school 
STEM program intern, the first in a series of Abbott internships 
that saw her through university and a bachelor’s degree in industrial 
engineering. Today, LaMiah is a full-time Abbott employee, 
working as an enterprise excellence trainer, teaching new 
employees to efficiently and reliably manufacture Abbott’s  
rapid test cards. See also page 44.DEAR ABBOTT STAKEHOLDER,
Sustainability is the fundamental challenge of our time.  
And it grows continually more pressing, as the last year has 
demonstrated in so many ways.
This is exactly the kind of challenge Abbott is built to address. 
Because thinking and acting for sustainability is inherent to our 
culture. And it’s a natural extension of our purpose—helping 
people live healthier, fuller lives. We pursue this mission very 
deliberately through our business strategies and processes. 
Abbott always takes the long view. We’ve succeeded for more 
than 130 years because we work at it. And we bring that same 
orientation—purpose-driven and achievement-focused—to our 
efforts to sustain not just our company, but our communities 
and the world around us.
Now well into the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
Abbott has been a significant contributor to the world’s 
progress against the disease, through the 12 different tests 
we’ve developed to identify the virus and help people live with 
greater safety and confidence. But we want to do much better 
than the old “normal.” We’re setting our sights higher, aiming 
to do our part in helping society make real progress in meeting 
its most urgent needs and building a better, more resilient 
world for the century ahead. 
This is made very clear by our 2030 Sustainability Plan. We 
conducted an exhaustive process, involving colleagues from 
across all parts of the company and around the world, to 
understand Abbott’s strengths and weaknesses, challenges  
and opportunities to create a 10-year plan that brings the 
company’s commitment to a new level.As this report demonstrates, Abbott remains a conscientious 
and effective contributor across the broad range of ESG 
priorities. We’ve made continual progress in reducing our 
environmental footprint, and we’ll keep moving toward ever 
more ambitious improvement targets. Similarly, you’ll see the 
innovative and committed ways in which we’ve supported 
communities around the world—another long tradition for our 
company and one we’ll advance further over the decade to 
come. We are passionately committed to advancing racial 
equity, as will be explored thoroughly in our separate Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion report. 
But the emphasis of our 2030 Plan is on the priority where  
we can make the greatest impact and do the most good for the 
most people: in focusing our future innovation on creating 
products that are affordable and accessible to more people than 
ever before. Using our primary expertise to help the world 
achieve greater total health at lower total cost is the most 
meaningful way we can contribute to the long-term sustainability  
of our society and our planet—helping more people than ever 
before live their best, healthiest and fullest lives.
Sincerely,
ROBERT B. FORD

OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESMeeting Unprecedented Demand 
As a global leader in medical diagnostics, Abbott understood 
from the start that COVID-19 would require a major mobilization 
on our part. We quickly formed multiple research and  
development teams, who worked in parallel, to create a range 
of tools to detect the virus and its antibodies at every stage  
of infection.
To date, their efforts have resulted in 12 new tests for use in a 
broad range of applications, from high-throughput instruments 
capable of handling large volumes of tests at once, to rapid 
point-of-care testing delivering reliable, on-the-spot results, fast.
Early in the pandemic, with only limited information available 
about the virus, our scientists leveraged years of assay- 
development expertise to create a series of tests for both 
high-volume laboratories and doctors’ offices.
These included molecular tests, which help identify active 
infections, to run on our Alinity® m, m2000 RealTime® and  
ID NOWTM systems; and immunoassay tests for our Alinity i  
and ARCHITECT® platforms to detect IgG and IgM antibodies 
to the COVID-19 virus, which help identify late-stage and 
previous infections. 
By the summer of 2020, we’d added to that portfolio with  
our BinaxNOWTM antigen test in the United States, and our PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid antigen test and Panbio COVID-19 
IgG/IgM rapid antibody test in countries outside the  
United States–rapid test devices that required no additional 
instrumentation to deliver results in minutes. In April 2021, 
BinaxNOW received emergency use authorization (EUA) from 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use at home, 
without a prescription. 
As important as creating the tests themselves was the ability  
to produce them at massive scale to meet the critical need for 
ongoing testing. So, we moved to increase our manufacturing 
capacity, quickly launching three new facilities, allowing us to 
deliver tens of millions of tests every month. 
Beyond diagnostics, FreeStyle Libre 14-day system was made 
available for use by frontline healthcare workers in hospitals to 
remotely monitor patients with diabetes who can scan themselves, 
minimizing healthcare workers’ exposure to COVID-19. And  
in our branded generic medicines business, we’ve seen a surge 
in demand for our vitamin C and vitamin D products as people 
seek to maintain good immune health. 
And our CentriMagTM Acute Circulatory Support System also 
made a significant difference. Used in intensive care units 
around the world, the CentriMag System provides short-term 
life support for people whose hearts don’t pump enough blood 
to meet their body’s oxygen needs.With the rise of COVID-19, in April 2020, the FDA cleared 
devices like our CentriMag System to provide long-term heart 
and lung support to critical-care patients for the duration of  
the pandemic. This led to an unprecedented demand for the 
product, which made rapidly scaling our global supply chain 
and establishing new production sites more important than ever 
before (see page 88). Our ability to quickly and effectively 
respond to these  unprecedented challenges helped Abbott 
thrive in 2020, ensuring our continued positive impact on  
the world.
Protecting Our People Around the World
Because Abbott has been designated an essential business, 
we’ve been able to provide an uninterrupted supply of vital 
diagnostics, medical devices, medicines and nutritional 
products to our customers throughout the pandemic. 
From the start, we made protecting of our employees’ health  
an essential condition of keeping our business operational.  
We established an infrastructure to procure and distribute 
personal protective equipment (PPE) to employees, and we 
take several measures at our sites, including enhanced cleaning 
processes, wearing masks, temperature checks and implementing 
social distancing.COVID-19: 
AN ONGOING RESPONSE   
TO A GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS  
 “With people like ours, and the robust  
supply chain we have, you get outcomes  
like we saw with the COVID response,  
where we can deliver meaningful, rapid  
and low-cost solutions to big problems.”
Andrea Wainer, Executive Vice President, Rapid and Molecular Diagnostics 1
 
 
In the United States, we regularly test employees and contractors 
directly involved in manufacturing our COVID-19 tests and 
have expanded this testing to other facilities and offices across 
the country. In late 2020, we began expanding testing to our 
manufacturing facilities in other countries as well. 
In a number of countries in Latin America, we contracted with 
private bus companies to provide a safer commuting option for 
our colleagues who continued to work on-site.
We also sent regular “Great Leader” emails to managers, 
providing tips, resources and support to help them better 
manage and connect with their remote teams. 
Caring for Our Colleagues 
As a result of the virus, we expanded employee assistance 
programs (EAPs) that offer health and wellness resources to at 
least 16 more of our country affiliates to provide:
•  Counseling services for physical, financial and emotional care
•  Ways to manage stress and anxiety during uncertainty
•   Local community resources, including where to find child care 
and elder care
•  Help with making the transition from working at home to 
back in the office
In September 2020, we introduced new ways to make the 
remote learning experience better for both students and their 
parents in the United States. We created several new benefits 
(and highlighted other existing programs) that employees 
could use to make life a little easier for child care or elder care, 
including backup care options. 
At some of our locations where colleagues were continuing to 
work on-site, we partnered with our cafeteria providers to offer 
food staples and hard-to-get items. We also delivered wellness 
kits to employees at U.S. sites and distributed more than  
24,000 kits to colleagues across the globe. Abbott has 109,000 employees in more than 160 countries,  
and we had no layoffs, furloughs or pay cuts in 2020 due to 
COVID-19. Even in a few rare cases where we halted production 
for a week or so, employees were paid for their normal work 
schedule. We have been offering our colleagues flexible working 
hours to help them manage their home and work schedules.
We also helped our people get back to their home countries, 
and their families, when border closures and travel restrictions 
made that difficult.
Additionally, employees have also been able to take paid sick 
leave if they are ill or quarantined as a result of COVID-19.
For colleagues in the United States who took advantage of our 
program to buy extra vacation days, we gave them the option  
to reduce the extra days if they were unable to use them and 
reimbursed them accordingly. 
Our Early Discoveries day care center at our Abbott Park 
headquarters developed new protocols that allowed it to  
safely remain open, providing child care for essential workers. 
Additionally, we began offering child care and tutoring discounts 
through partner facilities, free memberships to Sittercity, help 
finding nannies, babysitters and online tutors, and two free 
hours of virtual on-demand tutoring per week. 
The Clara Abbott Foundation, a not-for-profit organization 
managed and funded independently from Abbott, which exists 
solely to help Abbott employees and retirees who experience 
financial hardship, has provided financial grants to those 
struggling to afford basic needs because of increased expenses  
and/or loss of household income resulting from COVID-19.
We also implemented midyear dependent-care flexible 
spending account elections that allowed participants to make 
changes at any time, rather than only following a life event. As the COVID-19 pandemic grew, and the full extent of its 
impact became clearer, Abbott people sprang into action, 
collaborating with partners around the world to mitigate that 
impact for our stakeholders in every way we could. Because  
we hold Caring as a fundamental value, we take it as a point  
of pride that we treat the people who depend on us as if they’re 
our own family.
Early on, as some consumers began stockpiling goods, like infant 
formula, in anticipation of product shortages, Abbott stepped up 
to make sure that families with the greatest need could access 
our products. Working with the nonprofit organization Feeding 
America, we provided Similac® infant formula—more than  
1.7 million feedings—free of charge to food banks in hard-hit 
areas across the United States. 
Beyond our donation to Feeding America, Abbott and our 
foundation, the Abbott Fund, continue to support relief efforts 
globally, providing millions in funding and products to help 
address key needs. This includes working with relief partner 
organizations to provide frontline health workers with training 
and resources to advance testing and care, supporting families 
with needed supplies and information for the prevention and 
care of COVID-19, and helping meet critical local needs in 
communities where our employees live and work.COVID-19 RESPONSE:
SUPPORTING  
FAMILIES IN NEED3
Comprehensive Approach to Battling a Virus 
The COVID-19 pandemic has not only posed new challenges; it 
has revealed weaknesses and limitations in the world’s health 
systems. Communities already struggling with affordable access 
to healthcare, treatment and resources around the world are 
now all the more vulnerable. There is no one solution.
That’s why we took a comprehensive approach that included 
partnerships and local expertise and targeted the most 
vulnerable populations. In collaboration with the Abbott Fund, 
Abbott’s philanthropic foundation, we’ve given approximately  
$27 million in cash and product to support our communities 
and frontline workers across 63 countries.
You can find full details of these initiatives in our Innovating 
for Access and Affordability section on page 22.Building COVID-19 Testing Infrastructure 
Containing the COVID-19 pandemic has required building  
new healthcare strategies to handle the task of testing for the  
coronavirus, and tracking and isolating those individuals  
who are infected. Abbott and the Abbott Fund have invested 
directly in building this type of capacity in high-risk and 
underserved areas. 
The Abbott Fund’s COVID-19 Community Grant Program has 
partnered with Direct Relief to provide $5 million to support  
25 federally qualified health centers in the hardest hit U.S. 
states. The program has helped community health centers, 
serving predominantly Black and Latino populations, strengthen 
their capabilities to screen, test, triage and treat more than 
160,000 COVID-19 patients. 
In many countries, gaps in the supply of urgent medical  
equipment compromised the response to COVID-19 at crucial 
points in the pandemic. The Abbott Fund responded to this 
challenge by helping distribute personal protective equipment 
(PPE) and other critical supplies to healthcare workers in Italy, 
Spain and the United Kingdom. We also provided funding for 
medical supplies in China and partnered with CARE to help 
more than 129,000 people through protecting, supporting and 
empowering frontline health workers in Afghanistan, Colombia, 
India, Uganda and Yemen.The Navajo Nation has been one of the communities hardest  
hit by COVID-19 in the United States. We collaborated with 
Partners In Health and their partner, Community Outreach & 
Patient Empowerment (COPE) to advance COVID-19 testing 
and contact tracing. To date, this partnership helped train more 
than 900 healthcare providers and contact tracers and tested 
nearly 10,000 people, and provided follow-up and community 
support, including supplying Abbott nutrition products to 
almost 3,000 people.
We have been working with the Alive Faith Network and Rush 
University Hospital in Chicago and Community-University 
Health Care Center-University of Minnesota in Minneapolis to 
expand mobile COVID-19 testing, treatment and education. Our 
initiatives have targeted the communities at greatest risk from 
the pandemic, including Black and Latino communities that 
suffer from extreme poverty and high incidence of diabetes and 
heart disease.
Engaging Communities Through Our Employees 
Abbott employees are at the forefront of many of our community 
outreach programs, contributing their time, expertise and 
enthusiasm to help increase access to healthcare when it is 
most needed.$27M

Tackling the Pandemic’s Indirect Health Consequences 
Besides the threat of COVID-19 itself, the pandemic has 
restricted access to crucial healthcare services and supplies  
for many communities around the world. The pandemic is also 
leaving a legacy of mental health issues, which is affecting 
people beyond just healthcare workers on the frontline. We 
launched a range of additional community initiatives to tackle 
these impacts. We also supported a number of programs 
designed to support caregivers in vulnerable communities hit 
hardest by COVID-19. 
In Waukegan and North Chicago, Illinois, we are sponsoring 
children’s summer programs to support moms and other 
caregivers who are worried about returning to work, their  
kids’ well-being and other concerns; and we are sponsoring 
biweekly evening programming in topics that meet their interests.
In Canada, Colombia, Poland, the United Kingdom and the 
United States, we donated supplies of our FreeStyle Libre® 
14-day continuous glucose-monitoring system, which allows 
patients with diabetes to be remotely monitored. We worked 
with Feeding America and others to donate more than  
1.7 million feedings of Similac® infant formula in eight cities in 
the United States. In Indonesia and the Dominican Republic, 
we have developed and piloted mental health training and 
support for 372 healthcare workers, with a view to rolling out 
the initiative globally.STOPPING FUTURE PANDEMICS  
IN THEIR TRACKS4
 
 Abbott’s Pandemic Defense Coalition, launched in March 2021, 
is designed to help prevent suspicious viruses from turning into 
global pandemics.
COVID-19 underscored the importance of containing viral 
threats before they spread. That’s where the Abbott Pandemic 
Defense Coalition comes in, a first-of-its-kind global scientific 
and public health partnership dedicated to the early detection 
of—and rapid response to—future pandemic threats. 
Abbott’s growing network of partners includes organizations  
in strategic geographic locations:
•  Colombia/Wisconsin One-Health Consortium at the 
Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Medellin, Colombia
•  Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, 
Bangkok, Thailand
•  Institut de Recherche en Santé, de Surveillance Epidémiologique 
et de Formations (IRESSEF), Dakar, Senegal
•  KRISP , Genomic Centre of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, 
Durban, South Africa
•  National Center for Disease Control and Public Health, 
Tbilisi, Georgia• Rush University System for Health, Chicago, U.S.
• The University of the West Indies, Mona Campus, Jamaica
• Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil
• YRG Care, Chennai, India
The coalition is designed with a comprehensive approach 
to containing emerging threats, with partners ranging in 
expertise in scientific research, public health and diagnostic 
testing to attack new viral threats from all angles:
•  Doctors identify patients with unknown conditions, often 
the first sign of a potential viral threat.
•  Our Pandemic Defense Coalition tests patient samples  
on our existing diagnostic instruments to see whether a 
previously known virus is detected.
•  Genetic sequencing and analysis will then identify signatures, 
peculiarities or mutations.
•  If a potential threat is discovered, the sequences of the 
viruses found will be published in a public database.
•  If it is deemed a new viral threat, we will quickly develop 
diagnostic testing to assist in containment.

FUTURE STARTS 
WITH HEALTH
Health is the foundation for everything we can do—as individuals, 
families and communities. It helps societies thrive. It fuels successful 
economies. Abbott understands the vital role we play in helping 
people get and stay healthy at all ages and stages of life. 
At Abbott, the events of 2020 reinforced for us the importance  
of the work we do and the difference we can make by doing it 
exceptionally well.
Last year, our company’s fundamental strengths made us a key 
player in the ongoing fight against COVID-19. Looking ahead, our 
2030 Sustainability Plan will help us continue to make this kind 
of life-changing difference for more people, in more places, than 
ever before. 
Our Plan—developed over the past two years and providing a 
clear road map for the next 10—is built on the understanding that 
the best healthcare products are those that help the most people. 
Cutting-edge innovation alone won’t be enough.
We know we need to build products that are not only effective 
but that are affordable and accessible to more people. So, we’ve 
set clear targets around making access and affordability central 
to product innovation, transforming care for chronic disease, 
malnutrition and infectious diseases, and advancing health 
equity through partnership.
Accessibility and affordability are an essential element of the 
testing solutions that we are developing for COVID-19. At the 
same time, our ability to continue manufacturing and delivering 
critical healthcare products depends on the other elements of 
our Sustainability Plan that ensure our resilience and flexibility 
as a business.$76M

WE PUT THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AT THE CENTER 
OF EVERYTHING WE DO  
That’s our pledge to our customers.
It’s a simple and straightforward idea, but it guides decision-making 
across our business. We know that if we put the people we serve 
first, our decisions will always be the right ones—in the short 
term and for the long term as well.
That’s why this “customer obsession” is a foundational idea for 
our 2030 Sustainability Plan.
This mindset drives us to tackle some of the world’s greatest 
health problems with new breakthroughs that can impact more 
people. It means that we’ll work relentlessly—and with a sense  
of urgency—to get our products to more people, in more places, 
than ever before.
It reminds us to listen to, learn from and deeply understand those  
we serve better than anyone else does, ensuring we always meet 
their needs.
It makes sure that we’re always looking ahead, anticipating 
change and adapting what we do—and how we do it—to 
continuously exceed our customers’ expectations and stay 
relevant to their lives.
And it demands that we hold ourselves accountable to our values 
and the highest standards in everything we do. 
In the end, this singular focus helps us create differentiated 
customer experiences, increased customer retention and 
improved go-to-market strategies that let us deliver steady 
growth and sustain our business in even the most turbulent times.It helps us further strengthen our brand, cementing Abbott’s 
reputation as a trusted company that delivers life-changing 
innovation.

Officer, after a remarkable 21-year tenure and became Executive 
Chairman of the Board. Mr. Ford, previously President and 
Chief Operating Officer and a 24-year Abbott veteran, succeeded 
Mr. White as Abbott’s President and Chief Executive Officer. 
With this transition, Mr. Ford became the 13th CEO of Abbott 
in our 132-year history, all having been appointed from within. 
This is a testament to Abbott’s strong management philosophy 
and succession-planning discipline.
The Board is actively involved in succession planning and is 
focused on ensuring leadership continuity. The Board believes 
that the continuation of Mr. White’s service as Executive  
Chairman is in the best interests of Abbott and our stakeholders. 
The Board also has a Lead Independent Director, who is  
chosen by and from the independent members of the Board  
of Directors. Currently, the Chair of the Nominations and 
Governance Committee, William A. Osborn, is the Lead 
Independent Director. As Lead Independent Director,  
Mr. Osborn has distinct responsibilities, including liaising 
between the Chairman of the Board and independent directors, 
consulting and engaging directly with major shareholders, 
leading annual Board and individual director performance 
reviews, authority to call meetings of independent directors, 
reviewing matters such as meeting topics and schedules,  
and presiding over executive sessions of independent  
directors at each regularly scheduled Board meeting.  
The Lead Independent Director is elected annually by  
the independent directors. The Board reviews its leadership structure on at least an  
annual basis. The Board has determined that this leadership 
structure ensures that the appropriate level of oversight,  
independence and responsibility is applied to all Board 
decisions, including risk oversight, and is in the best interests  
of Abbott and its stakeholders.
“Sustainability isn’t a new concept for Abbott. 
We’ve been here for 130 years doing what we 
do. At the highest level, that’s the ultimate 
proof point for our strong, sustainable approach.”

Materiality Analysis and Stakeholder Engagement
The development of our 2030 Sustainability Plan has been 
informed by an in-depth materiality analysis of the most 
important environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues 
for our business. We worked with an external consultancy, 
Corporate Citizenship, to develop a rigorous, five-step process 
for identifying these issues.
1.  We conducted extensive research on potential issues that 
included engaging ratings and rankings organizations and 
customers; benchmarking against peers and competitors; 
tracking emerging issues; and consulting best practices from 
across different industries. This involved detailed analysis  
of more than 200 sustainability topics.
2.  We conducted 57 interviews with internal and external 
stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, investors, 
healthcare providers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), 
sustainability experts and employees.
3.  Abbott’s executive leadership team, which represents all  
of Abbott’s divisions and corporate functions, used this 
interview process to help prioritize topics according to their 
importance to stakeholders and their importance to our 
future business growth, including their relationship to our 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. This generated 
our materiality matrix of 17 ESG topics that will inform our 
strategy over the next 5–10 years.
4.  We convened working groups for each priority issue and 
engaged with our Finance and Corporate Audit teams to 
ensure our priorities and targets are integrated with Abbott’s 
business strategy and financial plan.5.  We held a day-long summit with 90 working group members 
and our executive management team, which helped refine an 
actionable Sustainability Plan built around seven priorities. 
We then defined the 2030 goals, targets and key performance 
indicators (KPIs), through which we will track our progress, 
drive improvement and ensure Abbott’s future competitiveness.  TIER 3       TIER 2      TIER 1

This process confirmed a clear focus for our business. We 
believe that the healthcare challenges the world faces cannot 
be solved by cutting-edge innovation alone. The best healthcare 
solutions are those that can reach the most people who need 
them, and this is the basis on which society should judge  
our industry.
Our priority as a business must therefore be to innovate for 
access and affordability. This involves both intentionally 
designing access and affordability into many of our life-changing 
technologies and products, and working with others to break 
down barriers that prevent people from getting the care they 
need. This clear focus informs the first three of our seven 
priorities under the Sustainability Plan:
1.  Make access and affordability core to new product innovation: 
We’ll design our technologies and products for broader 
access and affordability at every step–from every phase of our 
research and development (R&D) process, to the materials we 
use, to manufacturing, to the ways we reach the people who 
need them.
2.  Transform care for chronic disease, malnutrition and 
infectious diseases: Across our business and through 
collaboration, we’ll create new technologies and find new 
answers for chronic health conditions like diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease, malnutrition and infectious diseases 
such as COVID-19, HIV , malaria and hepatitis, as well as 
tomorrow’s pandemic threats.
3.  Advance health equity through partnership: We’ll work 
side by side with the people and communities we serve, 
partners, governments and other stakeholders to address 
health disparities, expand access and remove barriers that 
prevent people from living healthy lives.Foundations for a Sustainable Future
While our focus on access and affordability is central to our 
plan, we’ve identified four additional priorities that will be 
critical to a sustainable future for our business:
1.  Responsibly connect data, technology and care:  
Our data insights and connected technologies help people 
and their doctors make better, faster and more-informed 
decisions about their health in ways that fit easily into their 
lives. Just as important, we protect our patients and customers 
through secure and responsible data collection.
2.  Build the diverse, innovative workforce of tomorrow:  
New ideas come from different places and points of view. To 
achieve our ambitions, we’re actively shaping our organization 
for the future by prioritizing diversity and inclusion, 
advancing STEM education and internships, and empowering 
our teams with skills to meet the health needs of tomorrow.
3.  Protect a healthy environment:  
We’re working across our operations and with key suppliers 
to sustainably manage our water use and address climate 
change by reducing carbon emissions and expanding our use 
of renewable energy. Also, we’ll reduce the environmental 
impact of our product packaging and minimize waste in our 
operations through reuse and recycling programs across  
our company.
4.  Create a resilient, diverse and responsible supply chain: 
We’re building a more resilient supply chain, including  
working with suppliers to expand opportunities for diverse 
and small businesses, and actively engaging with suppliers  
to meet our high-quality standards.OUR TOP PRIORITY: INNOVATING 
FOR ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY
We intend to improve the lives of one in 
every three people on the planet by 2030.  
TAKING ACTION WITH TARGETED GOALS
In 2021, Abbott’s work will touch the lives of 2 billion 
people. By 2030, we intend to reach more than  
1 billion more, improving the lives of one in every 
three people on the planet. 
To support this vision, we have set targeted goals  
for 2030 for each of the seven priorities in our 
Sustainability Plan. You will find a full description  
of these goals in the relevant sections of this report.

Beyond these priorities and targets, we will continue to build  
a more sustainable business through the actions that we take, 
every day, on the other ESG topics in our materiality matrix. 
This includes ensuring product quality and safety, acting 
ethically and supporting human rights, advancing transparency 
and engaging our many stakeholders around the world. 
We will continue to report progress in each of these areas 
through our sustainability reporting. 
“As a company, we hold ourselves  
accountable to prioritizing both  
sustainability and our long-term  
impact on people’s health.”

Reporting Performance Against Our 2020 Targets
Abbott has been tracking progress against many of our 
sustainability priorities through clear targets that we  
established for 2020. We are pleased to report that in the  
vast majority of these areas, we have either met or exceeded  
the targets that we set.
We report on our performance against 2020 targets in all

PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABILITY 
AT ABBOTT
We believe that sustainability is built on integrated thinking, 
collaboration and applying our unique strengths. The following 
principles inform our approach and help amplify the inherently 
positive social impact that a healthcare business, such as ours, 
should have:
•  We drive a system of governance that puts sustainability at 
the heart of our business. From Research and Development 
(R&D) to Supply Chain, Manufacturing Operations and 
Product Marketing, we manage our environmental, social  
and governance (ESG) impacts to maximize efficiency and 
effectiveness.
•  We recognize that the healthcare environment is complex and 
interconnected. We invest in understanding the changing 
needs of different countries and cultures and the impact of a 
changing external and operating environment. By identifying 
the most material issues for our business and the developing 
needs of the people we serve, we can make purposeful, 
intentional decisions about how best to position our business 
for the future.
•  We build together by listening to the stakeholders most 
impacted by our products. We work with patients, consumers, 
healthcare practitioners, caretakers, external partners and 
suppliers to deliver sustainable impact.
•  We apply our unique strengths as a business in a focused  
way by identifying and investing in the most impactful, 
life-changing innovations, evolving our business to meet 
emerging healthcare needs and finding measurable ways  
to address social challenges through our scientific and 
technical expertise.Sustainability Governance
Abbott’s commitment to sustainable business starts at the top 
of our organization and is integrated across the company:
•  Our Board of Directors and senior management oversee our 
sustainability activities. The Board’s Public Policy Committee 
is responsible for reviewing and evaluating our policies and 
practices regarding corporate responsibility.
•  Our Global Citizenship Advisory Council (GCAC), a group of 
independent expert advisors and thought leaders in the area 
of sustainability, provides Abbott with guidance on strategic 
sustainability issues. This includes identifying risks and 
opportunities across our organization. The GCAC members 
include:
–  Margaret Flaherty, Senior Advisor, FSG, and Professor, 
Business School Lausanne
–  David Logan, Co-Founding Director, Corporate Citizenship
–  Jane Nelson, Senior Fellow and Director, CSR Initiatives, 
Harvard Kennedy School
– David Vidal, Emeritus Fellow, The Conference Board
•  Abbott’s Global Sustainability team works with colleagues 
across our global enterprise to implement our sustainability 
strategy, working with our four businesses, key functional 
areas and affiliates around the world. The Global Sustainability 
team reports to our Vice President, Global Marketing and 
External Affairs, who reports directly to our President  
and CEO.
•  The Global Operations Council (GOC) oversees execution of 
the strategy for all Abbott operations (Manufacturing; Supply 
Chain; Engineering; and Environment, Health and Safety), 
leveraging internal assessment, risk profiles and industry  
best practices to continuously improve Abbott’s performance.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The council is chaired by our Senior Vice President, Quality 
Assurance, Regulatory and Engineering Services, and 
includes three corporate officers and 26 divisional vice 
presidents, representing division and corporate operations. 
For more information on our management of operational 
sustainability, see the Environment, Supply Chain and  
Our People sections of this report.
•  Abbott’s Sustainability Working Group leads the integration 
of sustainability within our business and oversees Abbott’s 
reporting of ESG performance. The team includes representatives 
from Global Environment, Health and Safety; Ethics and 
Compliance; Quality and Regulatory Affairs; Cybersecurity; 
Human Resources; Supply Chain; Legal; Finance; Corporate 
Governance; Research and Development; Investor Relations; 
Public Affairs; Government Affairs; Corporate Purchasing; 
and Commercial Operations. It also includes representatives 
from our affiliate operations in key markets around the world.
•  Several of our global affiliates have formed their own local 
cross-functional sustainability working groups, which embed 
responsible business practices and drive stakeholder 
engagement initiatives tailored to local needs.

Managing Sustainability Risks and Opportunities 
Our sustainability strategy reflects changing healthcare needs, 
emerging challenges and priorities, as well as the changing 
nature of Abbott’s business over the long term. Our enterprise 
risk management (ERM) process focuses on short-term risks 
that have the capacity to impact our business performance.
Our analysis of materiality broadens our perspective to 
consider all of our stakeholders’ expectations of a sustainable 
business and the risks and opportunities that relate to meeting 
those expectations.
Enterprise Risk Management
Our ERM process is designed to evaluate risks on a consistent 
basis, measuring likelihood, impact and velocity to ensure the 
largest risks to Abbott have the appropriate focus and attention 
of our management team.
Our ERM network team, which was formed in 2017 , has  
15 functional experts, led by Abbott’s Vice President, Internal 
Audit, a corporate officer. The network brings additional 
structure and consistency to risk evaluation and works to 
integrate ERM within our business.
This group engages with a number of stakeholders who are 
subject-matter experts on various enterprise risks, helping 
identify additional mitigating actions that may be required to 
ensure risk management keeps pace with business strategy. 
Abbott’s Vice President, Internal Audit, presents an overall 
ERM update to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors 
annually and completes detailed reviews of specific enterprise 
risks with the Board of Directors or its committees throughout 
the year.Emerging Risk—Disruptive Technologies
The role of technology has never been more important in 
healthcare. Technology is advancing at a pace we have not seen 
before and is fast becoming a natural part of how we manage 
our health. We see a near future where medical devices are 
smaller, faster, connected, predictive and fit seamlessly into 
people’s lives—connecting patients and their doctors beyond 
the four walls of the clinic and enabling them to make accurate, 
timely and informed health decisions. 
The impact of the pandemic has accelerated the need for 
products that converge technology and healthcare at an 
unprecedented speed. This presents a challenge where  
we face competitors not only in our own industry, but also 
technology players who are currently making strides into the 
healthcare sector. We view these challenges as an accelerator  
to our innovation and as an opportunity to collaborate with 
technology companies in ways that can address health needs 
through meaningful innovation that is guided by patient needs.Technology leaders have announced initiatives that are 
disrupting the traditional healthcare business model and allow 
consumers to leverage technology to self-diagnose before 
seeking traditional healthcare providers. These include the 
introduction of new tracking and sensor features, telehealth 
initiatives and partnerships with researchers and healthcare 
companies to showcase and prove the effectiveness of their 
products and services as clinical tools across various conditions, 
including cardiovascular and respiratory health.  
As patient-driven healthcare expands and the use of direct-to- 
consumer devices for managing health increases, we must keep 
pace with these expectations. Our industry must be faster at 
bringing to market emerging technologies in order to maintain 
leadership and growth amidst the backdrop of nontraditional 
technology competitors with strong consumer engagement. 
To remain competitive, we need to continue innovating new 
technologies that are science-driven, consumer-friendly, 
accessible and relevant in the changing model of healthcare. 
We benchmark ourselves against both technology and health 
companies. We’re focused on innovations in health that fit easily 
into a person’s life. We’re bringing the power of connectivity  
to our wireless implants, wearable sensors and diagnostic  
tests through mobile platforms and smartphone apps that are 
enabling people to not only manage their own health better,  
but also share data with their doctors and loved ones more 
quickly, easily and securely than ever before. And we’re 
increasing collaboration, working with partners to integrate 
our glucose-monitoring devices with third-party pens, pumps 
and apps, to enable smarter, more automated systems for  
better, more personalized care.

OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICES
The changing landscape poses new opportunities at the 
intersection of healthcare and technology. With the spread  
of COVID-19 limiting the physical delivery of healthcare, we 
have seen a rise in the use and acceptance of telemedicine and 
digital health delivery, which accelerated the disruption to  
the traditional healthcare environment and emphasizes the 
importance of self-diagnosis and remote treatment to consumers 
and patients. We have launched several different products to 
meet the changing needs of our evolving healthcare environment:
•  Our i-STAT ® Alinity® TBI plasma test is the first rapid 
handheld traumatic brain injury (TBI) blood test, which will 
help clinicians assess individuals with suspected mild TBIs, 
including concussions. This gives the ability to diagnose a 
concussion within 15 minutes, helping to avoid costly CT scans.
•  The NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic is a first-of-its-kind  
technology that allows patients to communicate with 
physicians through a secure in-app video chat, allowing  
doctors to change settings on patients’ devices remotely— 
dramatically changing how chronic pain and movement 
disorders are managed. •  Our BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Self Test provides affordable, 
accessible COVID-19 rapid self-testing for home use. The 
easy-to-use 15-minute test can detect COVID-19 in both 
symptomatic and asymptomatic people, within their own 
homes. We’ve also developed a smartphone app, NAVICA™, 
which allows users to store, access and display their test 
results on their smartphone.  
We believe technology companies can learn much from the 
healthcare industry and vice versa. By combining our collective 
expertise and perspectives, we can put the right technologies 
together with the right sets of data to improve patient health 
and safety, decrease medical errors, protect patient data and 
privacy, reduce barriers to care and improve access and, 
ultimately, improve the quality of healthcare delivery. 
Emerging Risk—Impact of Pandemics
Public health crises, such as the widespread outbreak of 
infectious diseases, may negatively impact our operations. 
Disease outbreak has become increasingly common due to 
population growth, globalization and international travel, as 
well as the growing interconnection between human, animal 
and environmental health. Trends such as climate change  
and deforestation act as risk multipliers, driving an increased 
risk of future pandemics while heightening uncertainty as  
to the location, type and severity of future outbreaks.
Health concerns and significant changes in political or 
economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can lead to 
significant reductions in demand for routine diagnostic testing 
and medical device procedures or disrupt manufacturing  
and supply chains, negatively affecting our operations, as  
well as the operations of our suppliers, distributors and  
other partners.Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact the 
broader economies of affected countries, including negatively 
impacting economic growth, financial and capital markets, 
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Depending 
on the severity of the health crisis, all of these factors have  
the potential to disrupt our operations, employees, customers, 
patients and the communities we serve. Even as vaccinations 
continue to roll out, COVID-19 will continue to create significant 
impacts and uncertainties for the global economy.
“Complacency is our enemy. Whatever was 
good enough yesterday–whether it’s in our 
day-to-day business or in our sustainability 
efforts–is most likely not good enough  
for tomorrow.”
John Ginascol, Executive Vice President, Core Diagnostics
Abbott’s mitigation approach for disruptive events is both 
tactical and strategic. Our global Executive Crisis Management 
Team (ECMT) coordinates our comprehensive emergency 
preparedness and business continuity plans across our global 
businesses. Our ECMT is a cross-functional group of leaders 
representing key areas of global business operations and corporate 
support functions to ensure complete and efficient decision- 
making and facilitate consistent guidance, communications  
and support throughout the world. We continuously monitor 
suppliers, logistics and distribution channels to ensure minimal 
disruption to our business, and we have comprehensive response 
plans in place for all manufacturing and distribution sites. As 
part of our pandemic planning, we also develop processes to 
help monitor, protect and support employees, and evaluate and 
engage key logistics suppliers to ensure continuity of supply 
from our distribution centers to our customers.

In addition to our response capabilities, we have mitigated 
pandemic risk through our business and geographic diversification. 
Our four business groups and 10-plus business units are impacted 
differently in the event of a pandemic. From a demand 
perspective, the pandemic has impacted businesses, countries 
and regions at different times and to varying degrees. For example, 
elective surgical procedures and non-COVID-19-related 
diagnostic testing have declined in the past year while demand 
for nutritional products grew. Our sales presence in more than 
160 countries provides insulation from a localized demand 
shock. In addition, from a supply perspective, Abbott’s network 
of 93 owned manufacturing plants in 27 countries—plus many 
more third-party manufacturers—ensures that localized 
disruptions are unlikely to materially impact our ability to 
supply our critical products to the patients and consumers who 
need them.
Our diagnostic capabilities also play a critical role in pandemic 
response. Abbott has long been a leader in infectious disease 
testing, including the development of the first HIV test in 1985. 
Additionally, we recognize that addressing a pandemic requires 
different diagnostic solutions for the different stages of 
infection and recovery (as well as maximizing the venues 
available for testing).
In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, we leveraged our 
unique scientific capabilities to quickly develop diagnostic  
tests for the virus that could help protect frontline healthcare 
providers, first responders and employees of companies 
providing essential services (including Abbott) and facilitate an 
eventual return to normal economic activity around the world. We quickly assembled four discrete teams of research and 
development (R&D) experts to focus on different types of tests 
for COVID-19: molecular lab tests, a molecular point-of-care 
test, rapid antigen tests and serology tests. Working together 
with regulators, we have been able to create, launch and  
scale up manufacturing for 12 different tests across our  
technology platforms. 
As important as creating the tests themselves is the ability to 
produce them at massive scale to meet this extraordinary need 
for ongoing testing at the population level. We were able to 
move with unprecedented speed to increase our manufacturing 
capacity, quickly launching three new facilities, allowing us to 
deliver tens of millions of tests every month. To manufacture 
BinaxNOW, our rapid antigen COVID-19 test, we invested in 
significant additional manufacturing capacity, enabling us to 
produce tens of millions of tests every month.
Because we expect COVID-19 to evolve, we have developed  
an additional test on our Alinity m platform that screens for 
COVID-19, flu A, flu B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
using only one swab. This test will streamline hospital  
and laboratory efficiency in anticipation of a world where 
distinguishing one respiratory illness from another has  
never been so important.With the most comprehensive testing portfolio, we are able to 
get testing into healthcare facilities, educational institutions, 
workplaces, pharmacies and homes. Our combination of tests 
helps attack the pandemic on critical fronts—speed, simplicity, 
affordability, access and reliability, which aligns with our 2030 
Sustainability Plan, where we committed to designing new 
products for maximum affordability and accessibility for the 
people who need them. 
The course of any global pandemic is unpredictable, as the 
world has seen during the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic has 
also emphasized the importance of preparedness and containing 
viral threats before they reach every corner of the world. In an 
effort to prevent history repeating itself, we have formed the 
Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition, a first-of-its-kind global 
scientific and public health partnership dedicated to the early 
detection of—and rapid response to—future pandemic threats. 
The coalition unites global centers of excellence and experts 
who will simultaneously use their expertise on the ground 
around the world to identify, analyze, develop testing and enact 
public health guidelines in response to a viral threat could save 
precious time needed to help prevent exponential spread  
(see page 4). 
In the past year, we have demonstrated our know-how, 
scientific innovation, excellence in execution and management 
to both successfully manage business disruption and  
participate as a major contributor to combating the spread  
of a global pandemic. ABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      20

Engaging Stakeholders
Abbott is an active participant in the global dialogue on health 
and the broader role of business. We know that listening to our 
stakeholders is vital to our success. It enables us to respond 
with relevant, local solutions that meet people’s changing needs 
and tackle the world’s most important health challenges. 
Our stakeholder engagement is conducted formally through  
the many associations and partnerships of which we are 
members. We also seek to engage with stakeholders more 
informally through the networks and organizations in which 
we participate.
Our local country businesses play an important role in forming 
relationships with our stakeholders. We have defined a 
stakeholder engagement methodology that guides Abbott 
leaders in setting their local engagement strategies. We also 
require our local teams to review their stakeholder engagement 
strategies on a regular basis.
We report the outcomes of local stakeholder engagement in 
country-level citizenship reports or at local stakeholder forums. 
Through our engagement, we aim to stay well informed on the 
major issues of concern to all stakeholders, wherever we operate.
Customer Satisfaction
Our Net Promoter Score® (NPS) is an externally recognized 
metric for customer satisfaction, and we see it as an important 
measure of our success in meeting our customers’ needs. As  
an example of our performance, the NPS for our diagnostics 
business increased from 32.1 in 2010 to 55.4 in 2020.
“When we think about the future, we ask:  
How can we help more people in more places 
live better through better health? How can we 
be here well into the future to do the work we 
exist to do and have even greater impact?”

INNOVATING FOR 
ACCESS AND  
AFFORDABILITY
The world’s healthcare systems are under tremendous 
pressure. Many countries are struggling to keep pace with the 
growing disease burden of aging populations. Health gaps and 
inequities are widening across the globe. About one-third of  
all people today lack access to essential health products.  
To address this crisis, Abbott understands that we must find 
ways to expand access to care to more people on a sustainable 
basis.  We know that, going forward, fulfilling our purpose—
helping people live fuller, more dignified lives through better 
health—requires a redoubled commitment to getting our 
life-changing technologies and products to more people in 
more places.
Our philosophy is that the best healthcare solution is the one 
that can reach the most people who need it. That’s why Abbott 
is incorporating considerations of access and affordability  
into every aspect of our operations, from the research and 
development process, to how we manufacture and deliver  
our products, to the services we offer, the programs we develop 
and the partnerships we pursue.INTEGRATE

2030 SUSTAINABILITY PLAN TARGETS
Our 2030 Sustainability Plan sets the following targets to  
further embed access and affordability across our business:
•  Integrate access, affordability and data insights as design 
principles into our research and development (R&D) work 
and portfolio
•  Support global efforts to address noncommunicable diseases, 
including diabetes and cardiovascular disease
–  Innovate to transform the standard of care for diabetes  
and support efforts to bend the diabetes curve through 
innovative technology, prevention and education, early 
diagnosis, treatment and nutrition
–  Deliver breakthrough technologies, improve clinical  
outcomes and impact the lives of people with or at risk  
of cardiovascular disease–  Deliver scalable, integrated solutions to help reduce  
preventable deaths and infectious diseases—such as  
malaria, hepatitis B and C, HIV and COVID-19—with  
diagnostics, treatment and education programs, with  
a special focus on high-prevalence areas
•  Expand affordable access to healthcare for underserved, 
diverse and at-risk communities, including women and  
children, by delivering innovative, decentralized models of 
care that advance prevention and early diagnosis, improve 
nutrition, provide quality treatment and care, and lower  
total costs
•  Partner with stakeholders to improve health outcomes  
by advancing standards and building access to affordable, 
integrated solutionsWe work to consistently deliver market-leading products, 
services and solutions that address health needs while 
effectively managing the product life cycle. To support this, our 
businesses are incorporating access and affordability into their 
design principles without ever compromising quality.
This is not solely a matter of altruism. We know this is a 
sustainable business strategy, as this approach has driven the 
creation of some of our most successful products, including 
FreeStyle Libre, the world’s most-used glucose-monitoring 
system1, and our BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 test.
This focus is also particularly notable in our rapid diagnostics 
business, where we’re bringing testing closer to the patient, 
even in the most remote parts of the world. Our solutions are 
available from central hospital labs to remote health posts. 
Importantly, many of our tests work at the point of care and 
provide answers while the patient is still present, which accelerates 
treatment decisions and reduces life-threatening delays.
In neuromodulation, our devices—which treat chronic pain and 
movement disorders by targeting specific areas of the spinal cord 
or brain—help increase access to care with our NeuroSphere 
Virtual Clinic. This breakthrough technology lets doctors 
interact remotely with the devices to refine treatments in real 
time, securely over Wi-Fi or cellular network, letting patients get 
real relief in minutes. 
Breakthrough technologies that Abbott has in development 
include a rapid blood test for mild concussions that can  
help determine whether a CT scan is necessary; and a fully 
implantable left ventricular assist device that could be life 
changing for heart-failure patients.PRODUCT INNOVATION
TOMORROW’S CHALLENGES DEMAND  
NEW APPROACHES: FREESTYLE LIBRE®
The FreeStyle Libre system is our groundbreaking  
continuous glucose monitor. From the beginning, we  
designed affordability and broad access into this technology 
to reach more people with diabetes.
We took steps at every stage to make it affordable—and  
available to the millions of people with diabetes—starting 
with our R&D, supply chain and high-speed automated 
manufacturing, and then creating a consistent global price 
and working with governments to get it reimbursed.
This work translates into rapid access for people with  
diabetes, and a reduction in cost for local healthcare  
systems—potentially lessening the impact of one of the 
world’s leading noncommunicable diseases.

As part of our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we have an  
intentional focus on making our products widely available  
at affordable prices.
Pricing, however, is only one of the factors that determine 
accessibility. Abbott also advocates for systems and approaches 
that broaden access while minimizing additional costs for 
consumers and payers.
In 2020, our product pricing reflected our approach, with an 
annual global net sales price change of -0.4%, which compares 
to a 1.7% increase of a Global Consumer Price Index in 2020.
Local insights help us focus our innovation.
Our medicines business, which focuses solely on emerging 
markets, provides an excellent example of how we manage  
our approach to increasing access. While incomes rise globally, 
we know that people often pay out of pocket for healthcare, 
making it all the more important that they be able to access 
quality care that’s affordable. 
We listen, learn and partner in each country, using local 
insights to focus our innovation—making good medicines  
better and developing new technology and services to help 
people better manage their health. PRICING

TOMORROW’S CHALLENGES DEMAND  
NEW APPROACHES: BINAXNOW
The brilliance of our BinaxNOW COVID-19 test is in its 
simplicity: A test the size of a credit card provides results in 
15 minutes using no additional instrumentation. BinaxNOW 
pairs with our mobile NAVICA™ app to allow people who 
test negative for COVID-19 to display their result on their 
mobile device.
Abbott is committed to making COVID-19 testing widely 
available and affordable at a time when the world needs it 
most. BinaxNOW allows us to pursue that commitment. It’s 
an innovative testing technology that’s affordable and can  
be mass produced at a rate of tens of millions per month, 
allowing schools, employers and communities to utilize 
rapid testing.

Managing Diseases with Blood Transfusions 
Developed and developing countries alike are experiencing a 
decline in the number of young people donating blood. In 2015, 
Abbott launched BE THE 1™, the first global donor recruitment 
movement to focus on growing the pool of young donors. 
Blood and plasma are needed more than ever, and through this 
program, we’ve developed a powerful communication platform 
to help our customers inspire young people to donate. 
Since its launch in 2016, more than 100 blood and plasma 
centers have embraced this campaign, through which we work 
with major Red Cross institutions or donor associations in each 
country to activate and manage the program. As a result, blood 
donations have increased by as much as 37% in some countries. 
Preparing for Future Pandemic Threats
In 2021, Abbott launched the first-of-its-kind global scientific 
and public health partnership dedicated to the early detection 
of—and rapid response to—future pandemic threats.
The Abbott Pandemic Defense Coalition (see page 4) will 
connect global centers of excellence in laboratory testing, 
genetic sequencing and public health research with the goal  
of identifying new pathogens, analyzing potential risk levels, 
rapidly developing and deploying new diagnostic testing  
and assessing the public health impact in real time for new  
viral threats.Included in the coalition’s efforts will be a public database  
of viral DNA sequences that will let health officials and 
laboratories work together to determine whether an outbreak 
has been caused by a novel strain or by a virus that has 
previously been detected.
When physicians across the network encounter an illness that 
can’t be treated or diagnosed, they will notify the coalition 
about the possibility of a new viral threat and provide patient 
samples to partners around the world. These samples will be 
tested, sequenced and analyzed to spot trends and specifics  
that could indicate an emerging threat. Once a specific threat  
is identified, Abbott scientists will work to develop diagnostic 
testing to help contain the disease.
Combating Malnutrition
Malnutrition affects one in three people around the world, 
impacting all communities and people of all ages. With our 
science-based expertise in nutrition, from infants to aging 
adults, we’re uniquely positioned to improve malnutrition 
globally at the systems level.
This year, we launched the Abbott Malnutrition Solution 
Center, an internal, cross-functional innovation hub focused  
on improving the identification, treatment and prevention  
of malnutrition for the most vulnerable populations around  
the world. In addition to our deep understanding of nutrition 
and our ability to navigate complex systems, we’ll leverage 
partnerships, research, product innovation and financial 
support to bring accessible, sustainable and locally relevant 
options to the people who need them most. We’ll share more 
about our progress in the months to come.GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS

As a healthcare leader, we strive to make a positive social 
impact on helping people live longer and better. We apply  
our unique strengths to identify and invest in life-changing 
innovations, design new business models to meet emerging 
healthcare needs and find measurable ways to address social 
challenges through our scientific and technical expertise.
Our approach to global citizenship and shared impact is based 
on this belief and shapes how we work with communities 
around the world. We work side by side with people and 
communities we serve, as well as with partners, governments 
and other stakeholders to address health disparities, expand 
access and remove barriers that prevent people from living 
healthy lives, wherever they are.
Healthcare Closer to Home in Rural Africa
According to the World Bank, 60% of people in sub-Saharan 
Africa live in rural areas where access to healthcare is limited. 
These limits on the accessibility of healthcare constrain  
the potential of people and society. In Rwanda, Abbott has 
identified an opportunity to create shared impact by supporting 
the Rwandan Ministry of Health’s program to close the rural 
healthcare gap.
The Rwandan government has a bold vision to make quality 
primary care and testing available within a 30-minute walk of 
every Rwandan home. Through an innovative “health post” 
model, Abbott is working in partnership with the Ministry of 
Health and the Society for Family Health Rwanda to help build 
a connected health network and make it financially sustainable.By equipping the posts with rapid diagnostics, supporting 
nurses with testing and business training, and demonstrating 
the impact of the network on patients’ lives, we can help 
establish a model for primary care in rural areas that could be 
scaled across Africa and beyond.
In 2019, we worked in support of the Rwandan Ministry of 
Health and the Society for Family Health Rwanda to pilot 
second-generation health posts that address gaps in primary 
care and testing. These new health posts are designed to 
expand essential health services in rural communities.
Following this pilot program, Abbott partnered with the 
Rwandan Ministry of Health to develop the accreditation 
standards against which all health posts are certified.  
Approved in October 2020, these standards will serve as  
the basis of future performance assessment. Beginning with eight pilot locations in the Bugesera district  
in 2019, our new second-generation health posts provide 
much-needed maternity wards and antenatal care. The posts 
also offer HIV testing, treatment for infectious diseases (such 
as malaria, respiratory infections and intestinal parasites), 
pharmacy services and health education.
The posts are also quickly becoming a destination for the 
management of common noncommunicable diseases, such  
as diabetes and hypertension.
Abbott is also actively working with the Rwandan Ministry of 
Health and the Society for Family Health Rwanda to evaluate 
the expansion of services to include addressing nutritional 
deficiencies.HEALTH EQUITY THROUGH

Sustainable Access to Healthcare in Tanzania
In contrast to many companies, whose commitments focus on 
short-term programs, Abbott has made a long-term, ongoing 
commitment to strengthen—and drive sustainable improvements 
to—the healthcare system in Tanzania. For two decades, Abbott 
and the Abbott Fund have worked closely with the government 
of Tanzania to affect substantive, lasting change, including 
upgrading patient testing and care at the country’s largest 
public hospital, Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH).
Over the course of our 20-year partnership, we have:
•  Established emergency medicine as a new specialty at MNH 
and four regional emergency rooms. In addition to training 
more than 1,700 physicians, nurses and students—and 
graduating 56 medical residents through its residency 
program—this department provides emergency care to  
an average of 55,000 people per year and has reduced the 
mortality rate at the hospital by 40% in the first two years.
•  Built infrastructure, supported professional capacity and 
established a lab IT system for a network of 23 regional public 
laboratories, which supports more than 120 district laboratories. 
•  Supported a strategy for financial sustainability at MNH 
which helped generate a surplus of more than $14 million  
in the first six years, supporting the hospital’s commitment  
to providing critical care, regardless of ability to pay.BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS, ADVANCING HEALTH EQUITY 
There are vast disparities in who has good health and who 
doesn’t. Often driven by long-standing issues like poverty, 
structural racism, and access to healthcare, education  
and opportunity, these gaps have been amplified by the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
At Abbott, we’re focused on advancing health equity 
through our business and in partnership with others.
To deliver results, we’ve laid out long-term targets for our 
business, focused on intentionally designing our life-changing 
technologies to be affordable and accessible to more people 
who need them.
We’ve also made equitable care a key principle for our 
community partnerships, with targeted programs that 
remove barriers to achieving good health and address  
health disparities. 
A few examples include:
•  Health Equity Now: Abbott was the first to sign on as 
anchor sponsor of the American Diabetes Association’s 
(ADA) Health Equity Now platform. Our $5 million, 
three-year commitment aims to remove barriers to care 
and provide greater access to the latest medical technologies 
and health resources for diabetes populations, particularly 
underserved communities of color. •  Easterseals’ Black Child Fund: The Abbott Fund recently 
became the first sponsor of Easterseals’ Black Child Fund, 
a new effort to expand existing programming and develop 
new approaches to address health disparities, ensuring 
timely diagnosis and treatment for Black children with 
autism and other disabilities. 
•  Future Well™ Communities: This multiyear Abbott Fund 
program was launched in 2019 in Stockton, California, and 
targets diabetes by addressing the social determinants of 
health. We’re working with local government, leading 
institutions and community groups to increase access to 
health, education, healthy food and economic opportunity.

SUPPORTING AFRICA’S COVID-19 FIGHT
In many locations across Africa, emergency care facilities  
are limited or nonexistent. A small number of staff manage 
emergencies every day, operating on the frontlines of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
To help these dedicated experts, Abbott and the Abbott Fund 
are supporting the vital work of the African Federation for 
Emergency Medicine (AFEM) to reach 2,000 emergency care 
professionals in 26 African countries. 
“Our main challenge with COVID-19 is the lack of clear and 
concise information that is appropriate for our settings, where 
patient numbers are high but staff numbers and resources are 
scarce,” said Professor Lee Wallis, founder of AFEM. Abbott sponsored a series of virtual training webinars, with 
Abbott employees providing technical support to host and 
coordinate the webinars. During each session, AFEM and 
guest speakers shared best practices and information on 
testing protocols, personal protective equipment, triaging 
and treating patients, and maximizing limited resources.
Frontline providers also shared lessons learned from their 
country’s COVID-19 response. Abbott’s grant also funded the 
translation of targeted care guidelines, the production of 
short videos on COVID-19 care and a technical support line.In addition, the Abbott Fund is supporting AFEM’s 10-hospital 
pilot in Sudan to implement AFEM COVID-19 guidelines  
and protocols to generate real-world data and experience. 
Based on learnings from this effort, AFEM will then scale up 
implementation across its network through remote training.  
“The webinars and other resources are giving our workers  
critical knowledge they need to treat the daily influx  
of patients during this pandemic. And the pilot we’re 
implementing here in Sudan holds great promise to further 
advance the COVID-19 response here and elsewhere,” said 
Dr. Yasein Omer, an emergency medicine resident in Sudan.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      31

Data technologies are transforming modern medicine 
through the growth of connected medical devices, 
products, diagnostic platforms and systems. Abbott’s 
data technologies help people and their doctors to make 
better, faster and more complete decisions about their 
health in ways that fit easily into their lives. 
Living up to the trust that our customers place in Abbott 
requires a strong focus on cybersecurity in the ways that 
we design and support these technologies. That’s why 
our 2030 Sustainability Plan includes the objective for 
Abbott to be a trusted healthcare leader in secure and 
responsible data collection, use, management and privacy.
Abbott has established three guiding principles to 
protect personal information as we use data to empower 
patients and gather insights. We are: 
•  Intentional in how we connect our technology, what 
data we collect and how we use it and protect it. 
•  Responsible in our role in enabling the power of data 
and also in its responsible use and protection.
•  Transparent in communicating to people and letting 
them know how their data will be used.
We develop our products, processes and internal systems 
in a secure manner that ensures the safety of patients and 
their data. We are committed to evaluating and evolving 
our approach on a regular basis, and our current Privacy 
Policy can be found on our website . We comply with 
local regulations for reporting and notification of 
security breaches involving customers’ personal 
information in all locations where Abbott operates.

in our role in enabling the power  
of data and also in its appropriate 
use and protection.ABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      34
We have established governance for both data privacy and 
cybersecurity, consistent with Abbott’s commitment to 
responsibly collecting and protecting personal information.  
From a privacy perspective, in 2018, Abbott moved from a 
decentralized global privacy program to a centralized program. 
The Global Privacy Office is part of our Office of Ethics and 
Compliance (OEC) and is overseen by the Chief Ethics and 
Compliance Officer and Divisional Vice President for Global 
Privacy. We have standards, processes and training designed  
to ensure all Abbott employees understand that protecting 
sensitive data and personal information is everyone’s  
responsibility. We have both dedicated privacy professionals 
within the Global Privacy Office and numerous privacy 
champions in various countries around the world who are 
responsible for identifying and addressing matters relating  
to data privacy. 
We have evolved our approach to cybersecurity governance to 
enable greater focus on two equally important areas for our 
business: enterprise and product cybersecurity. By entrusting 
cybersecurity governance to separate organizations for each of 
these areas, we identify and mitigate risks to the security and 
safety of our products and the security of the data collected 
through them.
•  Responsibility for enterprise cybersecurity, including the 
security of Abbott data on servers, websites and mobile  
devices, and the cyber resiliency of Abbott’s network,  
business systems and manufacturing, sits with our Enterprise 
Cybersecurity organization.•  Responsibility for product cybersecurity, including secure  
design, development and ongoing cybersecurity surveillance 
for products in the customer environment, sits with our  
Product Cybersecurity organization.
Every Abbott’ business collaborates with these organizations  
to protect our prodcuts, systems and data.
Abbott’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) has overall  
responsibility for ensuring a holistic approach to cybersecurity 
across Abbott. For both cybersecurity and privacy, our Oversight 
Committee provides senior management oversight of our 
cybersecurity and privacy programs and advises on and 
monitors our cybersecurity and privacy strategies. The  
committee comprises officers of the company in the areas  
of Legal, Office of Ethics and Compliance, Finance, Human 
Resources, Quality and Information Technology.
In addition, a cross-functional working group—the Cybersecurity 
and Privacy Steering Committee—provides ongoing support for 
cybersecurity and privacy projects across Abbott’s businesses, 
educates and informs internal stakeholders on important 
developments relating to cybersecurity and privacy, and 
provides feedback on company standards and processes 
relating to the protection of Abbott’s systems and products  
and the data within them.Our overall approach to cybersecurity governance is designed to 
protect Abbott products and data through a focus on five areas:
•  Cybersecurity-embedded design: This involves a cybersecurity 
review and analysis as new products are built and systems  
are updated.
•  Cybersecurity training for all new hires and contractors: 
Abbott Enterprise Cybersecurity group also provides technical 
cybersecurity training  via internal and third-party resources, 
conducts a phishing awareness program, monitors for repeat 
clickers and targets training.
•  Constant threat and risk analysis, which is used to identify 
new threats and deploy cybersecurity controls: This is 
informed by collaboration with external experts and 
information-sharing agreements with specialists in the 
healthcare and cybersecurity fields.
•  Security testing by both internal and independent external 
experts: This approach is designed to help our devices, 
products and systems meet or exceed current cybersecurity 
standards.
•  Partnerships to assess trends, share threat information and 
establish standards that protect patients and maintain trust  
in the healthcare system: Abbott’s cybersecurity partners 
include other members of the healthcare industry, trade 
associations, security experts, academic institutions and the 
research community. 
 
Abbott recognizes the continuous evolution of technology and 
all its possibilities, as well as the threats associated with that 
technology use. So, we constantly evaluate and adapt our security 
tools, organization and processes to help ensure patients receive 
the highest quality care. The Cybersecurity and Quality 
organizations work to incorporate cybersecurity considerations 
throughout the product life cycle, including design, development 
and manufacturing, as well as the integrity of our quality data systems.Building trust is a journey that requires 
consistency and dedication.GOVERNANCE OUR APPROACH

SECURE DATA MAKES “CONNECTED CARE” POSSIBLE
Abbott has been helping to build the future of healthcare  
with what we call “connected care”–devices that use digital  
connections to let doctors remotely monitor, or even treat, chronic 
conditions; sensors that help people better understand their 
glucose levels and share their data with others; and even diagnostic 
tests that offer a kind of “health passport.” 
Take, for example, Abbott’s NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, which 
makes it possible for our neuromodulation devices to communicate 
with doctors from anywhere through an internet or cellular 
connection. NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic’s secure in-app video chat 
and remote programming—all accessible via a patient controller 
app—let doctors make an assessment and adjust the patient’s  
therapy settings by pressing a button on an iPad mini®. That 
message gets sent to a stimulator, which delivers mild electrical pulses to treat the patient’s symptoms. The doctor can observe  
the treatment’s effects, assess them and refine the precise 
programming of the device immediately. 
There’s also our FreeStyle Libre® glucose-monitoring system and 
the digital ecosystem we’ve built around it. Those tools include 
connected apps, FreeStyle LibreLink® (which helps people  
monitor their glucose via a smartphone), as well as LibreLinkUp®  
(which allows loved ones and healthcare providers to view 
glucose levels remotely).
These technologies proved invaluable during the height of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person visits became difficult, if not 
impossible. And none of them would have been possible without 
the robust data security built into these apps.Data security is also central to the pairing of our BinaxNOW™ 
COVID-19 rapid antigen test with its companion NAVICA™ app. 
As people began to reengage in activities and communities that 
had been restricted since the start of COVID-19, rapid testing 
proved to be a key tool for providing confidence and peace of mind 
when doing so. With NAVICA, a first-of-its-kind smartphone app 
that combines with our BinaxNOW COVID-19 tests, individuals 
can quickly display their COVID-19 test results, providing greater 
confidence and comfort as people reenter everyday activities like 
work, school, public transportation and more.CLIVE COUPERWAITHE

contributions to participant’s retirement accountsRESKILLING: A KEY TO ABBOTT’S SUCCESS
Abbott’s continual investment in our team is a key element 
in our long-term sustainability. We’ve long understood  
that helping employees acquire new skills in response to 
changing demands helps ensure that we’re always in step 
with—or ahead of—the latest technological advancements.
This commitment to reskilling and upskilling has been  
a formal part of our employee development process for 
decades. And, informally, we’ve been committed to developing 
our people since Abbott’s inception, more than 130 years 
ago. In fact, we’ve had three Abbott leaders who each rose 
from a nonmanagement job at the company—editor, 
advertiser and assembly line worker—to CEO. 
Through the years, reskilling, coupled with Abbott’s 
anticipation of medical and health-technology trends, has 
helped us become a leader in fast-growing markets, 
including diabetes care, diagnostics and heart health.
Our employee development opportunities span from free 
online development courses, to training for up-and-coming 
critical skills, to preparing our colleagues for entirely new 
careers, like at our vascular facility in Clonmel, Ireland.
In 2015, we started doing research and development (R&D) 
work for XIENCE Sierra™ drug-eluting stents in Clonmel, 
which is where the technology is manufactured. Needing 
R&D engineers, we developed a rigorous training program 
to reskill our manufacturing engineers in Ireland. In just 
five years, this group grew to more than 50 reskilled 
employees who developed five new vascular and endovascular 
products for the business.

Responsibility for Abbott’s talent management sits with our 
Executive Vice President, Human Resources, a corporate 
officer who reports directly to our President and CEO, and with 
our corporate officers, all of whom carry talent management 
goals. Abbott’s President and CEO leads our Executive Inclusion 
Council, reflecting the fact that our commitment to diversity 
and inclusion begins at the top.  
The council monitors the hiring and advancement of women 
and minorities in U.S. management positions, as well as 
monitoring opportunities to increase advancement for women 
globally. The council also works to promote an inclusive work 
environment for people with disabilities at all of our businesses 
and locations.Protecting Human Rights
Abbott believes in the dignity of every human being and 
respects individual rights, as set forth in the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our mission and  
core values reflect these principles, and they are reinforced 
through our employment, ethics and procurement policies, 
which also apply to all our suppliers. Our policy on workplace 
harassment states that we will not tolerate discrimination 
based on gender or other factors such as race, religion, color, 
age, ethnicity, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, 
gender identity or expression, marital status, ancestry, genetic 
information, citizenship status or any other status protected  
by local law.
We believe that governments have the primary responsibility 
for respecting, protecting and promoting the human rights  
of their citizens. However, Abbott recognizes that companies 
play a supporting role in promoting human rights within their 
spheres of influence.
We contribute to the fulfillment of human rights through 
compliance with laws and regulations wherever we operate,  
as well as through our policies and programs.
Our global guidelines include:
• Providing a healthy and safe working environment
•  Complying with child labor laws and laws prohibiting any 
form of forced, bonded or indentured labor, or prison labor
•  Promoting workforce diversity and not discriminating against 
any employee for reasons such as race, religion, color, age, 
gender, ethnicity, disability, marital status and sexual 
orientation, in addition to any other status protected by  
local laws•  Not tolerating any harassment (sexual or nonsexual) or harsh 
or inhumane treatment in the workplace, this includes 
providing harassment training for employees 
• Protecting individual privacy
•  Providing compensation and benefits that are competitive; 
comply with applicable laws for minimum wages, overtime 
hours and mandated benefits; and provide a fair income in  
the context of each market
•  Encouraging open communication between management  
and employees
We also have policies in place, including our Code of  
Business Conduct, that reinforce our zero tolerance for any 
discrimination and provide guidance to employees on how to 
report discrimination or harassment in our workplace. We have 
clearly defined escalation processes, investigate all reported 
incidents and take appropriate corrective action. As with other 
violations of our code, consequences for Abbott employees in 
case of discrimination or harassment include disciplinary 
action, up to and including termination. See the section Our 
Compliance Program on page 107 for more details.
Every Abbott employee in the United States is required to take 
unconscious bias and anti-harassment training annually.GOVERNANCE OUR WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT

TALENT MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Succession Planning
Abbott’s Board of Directors and senior management teams 
place a strong emphasis on succession and talent planning and 
on ensuring diversity and inclusion through this process. The 
Board conducts an annual Talent Management Review (TMR) 
in which critical positions, succession plans and development 
actions are identified.
The TMR process clarifies our succession strategy for our most 
critical roles and ensures diversity among identified successors 
in terms of perspective, experience, background and capabilities. 
In addition to destination jobs, we identify potential next roles 
for each incumbent and successor, with a focus on ensuring the 
right experiences for a successful ongoing career at Abbott. Our 
aim is to make sure that current and future leaders are building 
the skills they will need for success.
Similar succession planning takes place at every level of the 
company. The senior leadership team holds divisional, 
functional, country and regional TMRs, each of which sets out 
to identify “Ready Now” and “Ready Future” successors. This 
helps ensure that our pipeline of future leaders at all levels is 
continually maintained. Our people managers also have annual 
talent development goals.
Career Development
We have an integrated global talent management process that is 
designed to identify high-potential people and that links 
individual performance and career development. Our 
employees participate in an annual performance management 
process and work with their managers to create talent profiles 
and development plans that support their particular career 
objectives. We expect each manager to assess their team 
members’ performance and help each team member create 
developmental goals to help grow their careers. We further support our employees’ development through mentoring, skills 
assessments, performance appraisals and career pathing. We 
provide job-specific training, broader leadership training and 
other development opportunities to help our employees meet 
these objectives.
We know that the best development conversations incorporate 
the manager’s perspective and the employee’s aspirations, so 
every Abbott employee has access to Career Connect, a 
personalized career and development planning tool. Career 
Connect helps employees to identify their career priorities, 
have more productive development conversations with 
managers, identify the experience and skills they can gain 
through on-the-job learning, and create clear development 
plans for achieving their goals. 
Because of the global scope of our business, many of our 
employees work or travel outside of their home countries. 
Cultivating the ability to engage people across different 
cultures is therefore a priority for our business. It’s also an 
important development opportunity for our employees. 
Abbott’s Cultural Navigator® internet-based toolkit is free for 
all employees. It increases their understanding of different 
countries and cultures and provides guidance on business 
practices and social etiquette for more than 100 countries.
Our Speak to the World program provides employees an 
opportunity to learn a new language or get better at one they 
already know. The program is free to all our employees and 
does not need to relate to their work. It includes online 
self-study lessons that are available anytime via a mobile device, 
tablet, laptop or desktop, as well as the option to participate in a 
virtual classroom with up to eight other Abbott employees. 
More than 10,300 employees around the world participated in 
Speak to the World last year.We responded to the circumstances of the pandemic by 
increasing the availability of virtual instructor-led training.  
We converted 63 in-person instructor-led courses to virtual  
offerings to ensure employees would continue to develop 
during stay-at-home orders. We found that we were able to 
reach more employees than before. More than 41,900 
employees accessed resources on our eLearning platforms,  
a 129% increase from 2019.
Recruitment
Abbott is committed to building a diverse talent pipeline that 
can meet the needs of our businesses. We do this by developing 
internal talent and recruiting top talent globally.
Our integrated approach includes building a compelling 
employer brand, both through our own digital properties and 
through other channels; reimagining our candidate and 
employee experiences; partnering with academic institutions 
and associations that align with our needs; and providing 
opportunities for talented college students to develop their 
careers at Abbott.
We build our employer brand through targeted social media 
platforms, such as LinkedIn®. These enable us to reach and 
engage with talented people who have an appetite for innovating 
with a purpose. Our career site uses artificial intelligence to 
simplify the experience of searching for roles at our company 
through tailored content, recommended opportunities and a 
personalized chatbot that helps candidates identify the most 
relevant opportunities for them.14%

Our global internship program helps Abbott identify and 
recruit talent at an early career stage, giving students hands-on 
experience working with Abbott employees on real-life 
business projects. Each of our interns is paired with a mentor 
who has a similar discipline of study and background and can 
help the intern navigate Abbott’s organization, understand the company’s vision and prepare for a career with our company. 
We also promote international networking as part of the 
program, with tailored events and experiences to foster a  
global mindset. 
In 2020, we converted 63% of our interns in the United States 
into full-time employess, and we’ve set a goal of converting  
at least 50% in the United States and more than 40% of interns 
in international markets during 2021.
Our cooperative education program extends the experience  
of working with Abbott to students prior to graduation. The 
program invites promising students to alternate their classes 
with full-time employment in Abbott’s medical devices, nutrition 
and diagnostics businesses, as well as corporate functions.
STEM BLUEPRINT: 
SHAPING THE FUTURE OF STEM 
Women and people from diverse communities are  
underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering  
and math—or STEM—fields. We’re addressing the  
STEM skills gap by creating opportunities for more  
than 100,000 young people, including 50% from 
underrepresented groups, to participate in Abbott’s STEM 
programs and internships by 2030.
Through our award-winning high school STEM internship 
program, we know the impact even one positive experience 
can have on a young person to guide them toward a  
STEM career. 
We understand that we can’t change the future of STEM 
alone. That’s why we created our Shaping the Future  of STEM blueprint, a 30-page document that is a model for 
ideas and best practices for other organizations interested in 
launching high school STEM internship programs. It’s based 
on our experiences and offers a first-of-its-kind resource for 
any business looking to increase diversity in STEM through 
high school internships. 
In Ireland, we partnered with the Trinity Centre for People 
with Intellectual Disabilities (TCPID) to develop a version of 
our STEM program called SciFest@TCPID, which aims to 
encourage a love of science, technology and math among 
students with intellectual disabilities. In addition to helping 
participants develop their STEM-related skills, participation 
in SciFest helps them to grow in confidence and develop their 
communication and presentation skills.

Performance Updates
Employee Development
Our performance and career progression data continues to  
show that employees who participate in our talent programs 
outperform their peers at Abbott, are more frequently promoted 
and are more often identified as successors. 
In 2020, we developed and piloted Leading with Impact, a 
leadership training program for people managers. The program 
provides managers with the tools they need to help their people 
reach their potential. Specifically, they learn how to build trust, 
listen, recognize achievements and effectively coach and 
develop their employees. Leading with Impact provides a 
supportive environment for managers to learn from one 
another, try new behaviors and understand how to hear  
our people and what they want and need.
The core program covers 12 weeks, with an additional five 
months of actions to reinforce, practice and share key learnings. 
We launched the formal program in March 2021, and it is 
required for all managers who have at least one direct report.
Talent Pipeline
Our career site continues to drive increases in engagement and 
user satisfaction through our personalized chatbot and our new 
app to guide candidates through the interview process. In 2020, 
the site had more than 4.2 million visits in total, with average 
monthly site visits growing 61% year-on-year.We invested in improving the candidate journey by elevating 
the skills of our hiring managers. More than 1,685 hiring 
managers completed additional hiring-related training courses 
during 2020, with our training program receiving a 91% 
satisfaction rating. Our new HiringManager app provides 
access to resources, such as videos on interview best practices, 
interview guides and online learning courses tackling 
unconscious bias. 
Our internship program for students was ranked as the  
No. 1 healthcare internship program in the United States for  
the fifth consecutive year by Vault and is also certified as  
the top internship program in 14 other countries by 
ChooseMyCompany. For the first time, Abbott received a  
World Certification label for top internship program. In 2020, 
more than 60% of undergraduate interns and 70% of our MBA 
interns in the United States took full-time roles at Abbott, 
exceeding our conversion target for the program.Our mobile app for interns, which helps them navigate life at 
Abbott, is now available in 15 countries. In 2020, 1,053 Abbott 
interns used the app, publishing 1,113 unique posts and generating 
more than 837 clicks and just fewer than 200 comments.
Abbott’s high school STEM internship program has promoted 
careers in science, technology, engineering and math since its 
launch in 2012. Our goal is to increase the number of students, 
especially girls and those from underrepresented backgrounds, 
who pursue STEM-related education and careers. In the 
process, we aim to provide Abbott with a more diverse talent 
pipeline, and we have seen success.
Of the 150 students who have completed the program,  
97% have gone on to study STEM subjects in college.  
We’ve started hiring our first former high school interns  
as full-time engineers, and 11 of the 15 are women. In 2020,  
58% of those participating in the program were female, and 
73% were from minority groups. 
We remained committed to all of our internship programs  
amid the pandemic, continuing our U.S.-based programs 
virtually during the summer of 2020. Abbott also provided 
once-in-a-lifetime experiences for 50 members of our 
operations Professional Development Program, a three-year 
rotational program for new grads, who were reassigned to 
support COVID-19 test production in Gurnee, Illinois, and 
Westbrook, Maine. Many individuals took on roles as frontline 
leaders, managing more than 100 workers. Others developed 
training programs and worked on material supply chains, 
scheduling and procurement projects.
In addition to our STEM internship program, Abbott partners 
with iBIO to host a STEM girls summer camp, with the goal of 
improving girls’ interest and engagement in STEM-related fields.DIVERSITY IN OUR 2020 STEM

MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN STEM: LAMIAH TYSINGER
When LaMiah Tysinger was in high school, she started taking 
STEM classes. Something about engineering sparked her 
interest. “I liked the creativity of the career and the different 
ways I could go with it,” she explained.
So, she set her mind to learning all she could about a potential 
STEM career, joining Abbott as a high school STEM program 
intern. In the years that followed, she completed three more 
Abbott internships, working in diagnostics, supply chain 
management and quality assurance—all while earning her 
bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering. While she was still learning, she also found herself teaching. As 
a college STEM intern with Abbott, she received career 
mentorship from a full-time employee while also helping a high 
school STEM mentee acclimate to her new professional 
settings and plan her educational path.
Fresh out of college, Tysinger is now a full-time enterprise 
excellence trainer with Abbott, teaching new employees to 
efficiently and reliably manufacture Abbott’s BinaxNOW™ 
cards, which provide rapid-result COVID-19 testing. 
Despite the pandemic, she continued working on-site to ensure 
everything was ready to go and new hires were prepared to 
begin producing the BinaxNOW test cards. Nine to 10 hours per day, she focused on educating assembly operators on life-saving 
technologies and protocols and worked on critical site-
improvement projects.
She enjoys connecting with her trainees and appreciates the 
opportunity to develop her soft skills early in her career. She 
hopes they will help her be a better manager in future positions. 
“We’re making tests that will save the world. The fact that  
I have a hand in it—and a pretty significant hand in it—is  
motivating,” she said. “It makes me feel empowered.”

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
Abbott is committed to developing a workplace that is inclusive 
for all, regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, 
disability or nationality. Diversity and inclusion is a part of who 
we are, how we lead and what we believe in. 
In 2020, we increased our focus on diversity and inclusion  
by naming a new Divisional Vice President of Diversity &  
Inclusion, who is charged with developing diversity and 
inclusion strategies that will continue to ensure Abbott 
provides an inclusive work environment. 
Our 10 employee networks play a vital role in building an 
inclusive culture across all Abbott operations. They help expand 
visibility and opportunity for their more than 10,000 members 
from minority and other traditionally underrepresented groups, 
working with our Diversity and Inclusion team to help tackle 
unconscious bias. An Abbott executive, in most cases a 
corporate officer, serves as an executive sponsor for each of 
these networks, helping to align their objectives with Abbott’s 
business strategies. 
We operate the following employee networks:
• Advancing Professionals Network (APN)
• Asian Leadership and Cultural Network (ALCN)
• Black Business Network (BBN)
• disABILITY Network
•  Flex Network (employees with part-time and flexible schedules)
•  LA VOICE Network (supporting Hispanic and  
Latino employees)
• PRIDE (supporting LGBTQ+ employees)
• Veterans Network
• Women Leaders of Abbott (WLA)
• Women in STEMIn 2020, we launched our newest employee network, the 
disABILITY Network, supporting people with disabilities,  
and it has received tremendous support from our employees. 
The initial awareness meeting had more than 600 people  
in attendance. We believe this reflects Abbott’s commitment  
to making sure we provide an equitable workplace for all. 
Ensuring an inclusive environment for people with disabilities 
requires us to commit to raising awareness of the issues 
involved, educating both managers and employees. Abbott 
works with local partners to provide training on the experiences 
of employees with disabilities and to help avoid unconscious 
bias in our hiring process.
Additionally, in 2021, our employee networks stood together  
to express solidarity with our Asian American colleagues. Our 
Divisional Vice President of D&I, employee network leadership 
and executive sponsors issued a joint statement to our 
employees in the United States condemning the violent attacks 
and harassment targeting the Asian American community.
Building a More Inclusive Culture 
Following the murder of George Floyd, Abbott announced that 
the Abbott Fund would provide a two-for-one match for 
employee contributions to any of 12 organizations focused on 
addressing racial inequities. 
Our public statement, published on our website on June 4, 
2020, discussed issues of racial inequality and bias and our 
commitment to addressing these underlying systemic issues 
through our ongoing programs to increase healthcare access 
and expand STEM education.Our President and CEO Robert Ford wrote to all Abbott 
employees, reiterating that racism is not just against our 
company’s values but is the antithesis of those values. The 
executive sponsor and co-chairs of our Black Business Network 
(BBN) employee group wrote to all BBN members setting out 
three principles to guide Abbott in developing an action plan  
to respond to this movement:
•  Create a culture of openness and transparency: We must be 
willing to engage in constructive and honest dialogue that  
is aimed at understanding and knowledge, which is the first 
step to change.
•  Attacking systemic racism is everyone’s responsibility: There 
is no single person or entity responsible for racism. We must 
all be accountable for how we got here and where we go next.
•  Become the bridge to change: We need collaboration 
throughout our network and partnership with our colleagues 
outside of the BBN community, especially the allies who are 
committed to proactively and authentically building inclusion. 
It will take all of us to identify and implement solutions to 
racism, inequality and underrepresentation.

Diversity and Inclusion Performance Updates
In 2020, we delivered new development programs focused on 
employee growth and engagement and expanded our learning 
programs dealing with inclusion. We launched an online 
Fostering Diversity & Inclusion course to drive engagement 
across all employees, including those working remotely. We 
have designed the course to meet employees wherever they  
are in the journey to be more inclusive, incorporating beginner- 
and advanced-level tools and training.
We also placed particular emphasis on mentoring, with a 
formal program that matches mentors with protégés for 
12-month partnerships. In 2020, there was a more than 35% 
increase in the number of mentor and protégé registrations 
among employees. 
These partnerships help mentors and protégés develop their 
skills, share knowledge of Abbott and broaden their networks. 
We have mentorship programs designed to provide career 
support to newly hired minority and female leaders, as well  
as to improve our global disability outreach.
 Abbott’s commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion is 
consistently recognized by external organizations. In 2020:
•  Working Mother magazine included Abbott on its list of the 
best companies for the 20th consecutive year and also on its 
list of the best companies for multicultural women. This 
consistent performance led to Abbott’s being inducted into

Employee Donations and Matched Giving 
Abbott’s commitment to supporting communities is demonstrated 
through our employees’ passion for giving back. Abbott 
employees give generously of their time, expertise and 
resources, supporting numerous community-based initiatives 
worldwide. In the United States and Puerto Rico, our annual 
Employee Giving Campaign gives our employees an opportunity 
to donate to the nonprofits they care the most about.
In 2020, 95% of Abbott employees donated to 8,291 nonprofit 
organizations. In the United States, the Abbott Fund provides  
a 50% match to employees’ contributions to qualifying  
causes. When these matching donations were included, the 
Employee Giving Campaign pledged a total of $7 .58 million,  
a significant rise from 2019’s total of $6.71 million. This rise  
is particularly noteworthy in the difficult circumstances of  
the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition to the annual Employee Giving Campaign, Abbott 
held a special campaign in the United States in 2020 to help 
address racial inequity. As part of this campaign, Abbott Fund 
provided a two-for-one match for every employee donation to 
certain organizations that address systemic issues of racial 
inequities through policy, health equity and/or community 
engagement. Through this campaign, more than 100 different 
organizations were supported by more than 960 employees. 
The Abbott Fund provided a match of more than $413,000 to 
help these organizations address racial inequality. When these 
matching donations were added to the employee donations, 
this special campaign raised more than $619,000 to help 
address racial equity.Throughout the year, Abbott employees are also able to donate 
to the 1.3 million organizations listed on our online employee 
giving portal. Abbott pays all fees associated with processing 
these donations, so that every cent our employees give goes to 
the charity of their choice.
Employee Volunteering
All Abbott employees in the United States can request eight 
hours of paid time off for volunteering during the working day, 
and every year in the United States, we designate Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day as “Day of Caring” to encourage 
volunteerism. Because of COVID-19, the total number of 
volunteer hours contributed by Abbott employees declined 
significantly during 2020, from 37 ,734 volunteer hours to 7 ,933. 
Our volunteers supported causes in more than a dozen 
countries around the world.
We work with schools, governments, educational organizations 
and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) around the world 
to contribute to the science, technology, engineering and math 
(STEM) pipeline, leveraging the philanthropic resources of  
the Abbott Fund, as well as our employees’ time, skills and 
passion for volunteering. By inspiring young people to explore 
careers in STEM today, we can produce innovators for our 
industry tomorrow. During 2020, 67 of our colleagues volunteered 228 hours to our 
Operation Discovery and Family Science programs. Operation 
Discovery has had 1,838 volunteers since its inception in 2002. 
Since 2006, 6,765 Abbott scientists, engineers and other 
employees have now shared their expertise to support 
programs that advance STEM education around the world.  
The Abbott Fund has supported these efforts with donations  
of more than $61 million during this time.2020 FAMILY SCIENCE VOLUNTEERING

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS
Our compensation philosophy plays a vital role in attracting the 
best and brightest minds to work at Abbott and in building an 
environment of equal opportunity for all.
We apply the following principles to help achieve consistent, 
fair compensation packages that reward performance:
•  Base salaries and benefit packages are based on, and  
competitive in, the markets where we compete for talent and 
are appropriate to each market.
•  Annual and long-term incentive packages are linked directly 
to business and individual performance, with a balance of 
short- and long-term financial and strategic objectives.
•  Our approach to compensation encourages behavior that  
is consistent with the ethical values in Abbott’s Code of 
Business Conduct.
The fundamental principle of compensation at Abbott is that  
it should be driven by employees’ level of responsibility, 
expertise and performance. We have processes to ensure 
consistency in compensation across similar roles in relevant 
markets. As a result, Abbott compensates employees based on 
the work they do, regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. We  
are committed to equal pay for equal work, and do not tolerate 
discrimination in pay, as stated in our position statement on 
human rights. Abbott has procedures that encourage frequent 
manager and employee dialogue around performance and 
compensation, and we make a range of channels available for 
employees to raise any concerns in this area. One component of our total compensation philosophy is to 
enable employees to build an ownership stake in our company. 
We operate several programs to facilitate this:
•  Abbott’s global long-term incentive program grants restricted 
stock units (RSUs) to employees, generally beginning at the 
manager level. Over time, when the awards vest, they are paid 
out in shares of Abbott common stock (except in countries 
that require payment in cash). In 2020, Abbott granted RSUs 
to approximately 12,500 employees in 73 countries.
•  In the United States and Puerto Rico, employees can invest in 
Abbott stock through our 401(k) program, which provides a 
5% match to an employee’s 2% contribution to the program.
•  In most countries outside of the United States, we offer 
employees the opportunity to purchase Abbott stock at a 
discount through the Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). 
The ESPP is open to all employees, except corporate officers, 
in the countries where we offer it. In 2020, 146 Abbott 
affiliates in 59 countries participated in the ESPP .
Employee eligibility for nonsalary benefits follows local 
regulations and practices. In most countries, this means we 
offer benefits to full-time employees and part-time employees 
working more than a certain number of hours. Outside the 
United States, we typically provide benefit programs that are 
above and beyond government requirements.
Our global Human Resources (HR) teams work to identify the 
particular needs of employees in different countries, so that we 
can deliver innovative solutions that make a tangible difference 
and strengthen our value proposition for employees on a  
local basis.Our first-of-its-kind Freedom 2 Save program helps employees 
with student loans save for retirement while they make their 
loan payments, providing an innovative solution to the debt 
burden for young people in the United States.
Under the program, employees who put at least 2% of their 
eligible pay toward their student loan debt can receive a 5% 
contribution from Abbott into their 401(k) accounts, without 
any 401(k) contributions of their own. This means that the 
participating employees do not sacrifice saving for their future 
while paying off their educational debt. More than 1,290 
employees have enrolled in the program since it launched  
in 2018.
For retirement-eligible employees, we offer Freedom to Work,  
a program that lets them reduce their schedule, workload  
and/or responsibilities—sharing their knowledge with  
colleagues while continuing to build their pensions. More  
than 1,700 employees have enrolled in this program since it 
launched in 2008.Abbott has policies in place to help ensure our 
employees receive comparable compensation, 
regardless of race or gender.

LISTENING TO OUR EMPLOYEES
Our Approach
We have a listening strategy that includes quarterly surveys to 
ask our employees about the experience of working at Abbott  
to understand their engagement in our business strategy. This 
is an opportunity to learn where we can make meaningful 
improvements. These surveys include questions related to 
engagement, culture and the general working environment.  
All employees are asked for their input at least once a year.
We also participated in Top Employers surveys in Europe and 
the Middle East, as well as the Great Places to Work® survey. 
Great Place to Work® invites around 5,000 Abbott employees in 
the United States to participate in its annual survey of working 
experiences and employee engagement.
Besides surveys, Abbott relies on a variety of formal and 
informal channels to gather employee feedback. These include 
an annual All-Employee Meeting with our President and CEO, 
where a significant portion of the meeting is dedicated to 
addressing employee questions and comments. Our senior 
leaders also respond to employee comments and concerns at  
small-group and town-hall-style meetings. In our Code of 
Business Conduct, we emphasize the importance of employees 
reporting concerns and the process for escalating them. This 
commits us to creating an environment where employees raise 
concerns in good faith without fear of retaliation. 
The more than 10,000 employees involved in our employee 
networks have a range of additional forums for raising common 
interests and concerns, including recommendations for 
programs and development opportunities. Employee Well-Being
Abbott takes a holistic approach to employee well-being.  
We offer programs that support work-life harmony and 
promote good health, and we make many of these programs 
available to our employees’ family members.
In 2020, a major focus of our employee well-being programs 
has been supporting the transition of our office teams to 
working remotely. This included providing additional online 
well-being courses from the start of the pandemic onward.
We care about the mental health of our employees. We take an 
integrated approach that includes addressing causes of stress, 
both within and outside the workplace. Our company-funded 
employee assistance program (EAP) provides free expert 
mental health support for employees and their families through 
one-on-one support, seminars, online courses, crisis intervention 
services and workplace emergency response. 
Our LiveLifeWell integrated wellness program, available in  
the United States, caters to the mental, financial and physical 
health of employees and their spouses through assessments and 
programs. LiveLifeWell also offers an app to help users track 
progress toward well-being goals, such as nutrition, exercise, 
resiliency and sleep. The app provides access to screenings, 
health coaches, counseling, caregiver support, employee 
assistance, resiliency skills and stress management.
We know this app is proving particularly valuable during the 
COVID-19 pandemic because approximately 79% of employees 
and eligible spouses participated in 2020, and it has helped 
them take more than 38.1 billion steps.In Brazil, we implemented a virtual wellness program—with 
orientation sessions led by physical educators—that included 
activities such as gymnastics and mindfulness sessions. We’ve 
held six virtual sessions per week since April. 
Our most popular and long-standing physical wellness program 
is Exercise Across Abbott, which encourages our employees to 
team up with colleagues and compete for prizes by tracking 
how many minutes they exercise each day. This provided a 
valuable shared experience for our employees when socially 
distanced and working remotely. Around 20% of Abbott employees 
across 72 countries took part in Exercise Across Abbott in 2020. 
We recognize that flexible working is often an essential enabler 
of employee well-being, and especially so when employees are 
working from home and taking on additional child care and 
other responsibilities. Abbott embraces flexibility throughout 
our workplace, allowing many employees to combine various 
flex options to meet shifting work-life demands and evolving 
life needs.

Depending on their roles and the country in which they work, 
employees have access to a variety of formal workplace 
flexibility options that can include flextime, compressed work 
weeks, reduced work schedules, job sharing and teleworking, 
as well as other approaches like shift trades, as-needed 
flextime, summer hours and phased retirement.
Our comprehensive child care programs in the United States 
include on-site child care, parenting and counseling services, as 
well as nationwide child care discounts and backup care resources. 
We offer new parents eight weeks of paid time off at 100% to 
use within one year following the birth or adoption of a child, 
and provide Milk Stork® breast milk delivery services for 
business-traveling mothers. Since 2015, Abbott has also 
provided financial support for adoption of up to $20,000  
per child.
In the United States, in early 2021, we launched a comprehensive 
child care program and parenting benefits site, which offers 
direct access to Abbott’s many benefits for parents and 
parents-to-be, such as tutoring and child care services.
Abbott offers paid bereavement leave to all employees in the 
United States in the tragic circumstance of losing a loved one. 
We provide up to 80 hours of paid leave in the event of losing a 
dependent child, spouse or domestic partner and 40 hours of 
paid leave in the event of losing an extended family member.
Voting is a right and a responsibility, and Abbott supports  
our employees’ right to vote. We provided up to four hours  
of paid leave to enable employees to vote in 2020’s federal, 
primary and general elections in the United States.
Our comprehensive child care  
programs include on-site  
child care, parenting and  
counseling services, nationwide  
child care discounts and backup  
care resources.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      52
Governance
The health, safety and wellness of our employees and contract 
workers is a priority for Abbott. We have embedded this 
priority at every level of our business through our integrated 
Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) management system. 
The EHS organization provides governance for health,  
safety and wellness, which includes ownership of our EHS 
management and technical standards published on our website . 
Additionally, our Supplier Guidelines require our suppliers  
to protect workers in the workplace by providing a safe and 
healthy environment. Abbott expects suppliers to comply with 
all legal and regulatory requirements regarding employee 
health and safety.
Abbott’s EHS Leadership Council governs our EHS organization. 
This includes EHS professionals, who manage EHS programs 
at our 113 manufacturing and research and development (R&D) 
sites, and commercial EHS professionals, who provide support 
to field-based teams, offices and warehouses across 80 countries. 
We have divided our commercial EHS organization into six 
geographical regions, with each region represented by an  
EHS regional manager. Our operations EHS professionals are 
aligned according to business unit. Our global Occupational Health Services (OHS) team, which 
forms part of our global EHS organization, provides global 
occupational health leadership and strategic direction. The 
team develops and maintains Abbott’s global occupational  
health (OH) policies, procedures and guidelines, trains and 
develops our OH employees, and consults on regulatory 
compliance. This team is also responsible for implementing our 
global strategy to promote employee health and productivity, 
tracking progress against our key performance indicators 
(KPIs) and identifying opportunities for improvement.
Our EHS and OHS teams also lead Abbott’s global response to 
public health emergencies with potential business impact and 
have taken a key role in our measures taken to protect employees 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the pandemic  
in 2020, Abbott conducted regular testing and screening of  
our employees. This has helped to maintain healthy work 
environments and ensure the health and safety of our people. 
In fact, Abbott employees have tested positive for COVID-19 at 
lower rates than their communities.
We have developed two technical standards that support  
our OHS team in its role. Our Occupational Health Services 
Standard requires that all Abbott facilities provide their 
employees with appropriate occupational health services, 
including adequate resources and a designated healthcare 
professional. Our Reproductive Hazard Management  
Standard ensures the health and safty of employees and their 
potential future children through specific hazard control, 
documentation and risk communication requirements.We require each Abbott manufacturing facility to have a 
designated occupational healthcare professional who has 
knowledge of the site and its operations and is responsible  
for implementing an appropriate occupational health  
program. There are more than 130 Abbott occupational  
health professionals who oversee our employees’ health  
and well-being, treat occupational illnesses and injuries,  
and maintain employee medical records.
We also use established external standards and certification to 
help drive continuous improvement in occupational health and 
safety. At the end of 2020, three Abbott sites were certified to 
Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 
and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 45001.
For full details of our EHS governance structure, including the 
groups that support implementation of our EHS programs and 
initiatives, see the Environment section on page 61 . EMPLOYEE HEALTH, SAFETY  
AND WELLNESS
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in 
2020, Abbott conducted regular testing and 
screening of our employees, helping to 
maintain healthy work environments and 
ensure the health and safety of our people.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      53
Management Approach
We maintain global policies and standards for managing 
employee health and safety. Technical and management experts 
regularly update these policies and standards in response to 
regulatory changes and evolving global requirements and 
expectations. We focus on improving performance, ensuring 
compliance, reducing risk and embedding a culture of safety 
across our operations.
Our technical standard on Contractor EHS Management 
extends to all contractors working at Abbott locations and 
requires that each Abbott site implements a written Contractor 
EHS Management Program. This management program 
includes the following:
•  Training for all Abbott employees responsible for contractor 
activity
• An EHS approval process for contractor companies
• EHS orientations for contractor employees
• Project-specific EHS plans for all projects more than $2 million
•  A full-time, dedicated safety representative on large  
construction projects
• EHS inspections of contractor activity
•  Requirements for contractors to complete a Job Hazard 
Analysis or Risk Assessment and Method Statement 
•  A process for evaluating each contractor company’s  
EHS performance We regularly evaluate Abbott commercial operations,  
manufacturing and R&D sites through internal compliance 
assurance audits. These audits assess performance in the 
following categories:
• Health and safety
• Strategic planning
• Risk assessment/self-assessment
• Business integration
• Training and awareness
• Communication and information
• Performance measures
Our senior leadership uses Abbott’s EHS Scorecard to monitor 
health and safety performance and progress toward our targets. 
The scorecard captures important data, such as the number of 
significant EHS incidents, lost-time case rate, recordable case 
rate and accidents per million miles (APMM) driven. We 
communicate the scorecard data across our organization, 
identify where corrective actions are needed and ensure that 
these actions are completed on time.
We have a separate Global Health Scorecard that our site  
and divisional leaders use to track implementation of our 
occupational health and well-being initiatives. The Global 
Health Scorecard is used to monitor the annual occupational 
health and wellness performance of our manufacturing  
and R&D sites. It uses a dynamic scoring system, with the 
requirement for each site to increase its score year over year.In alignment with industry best practices, in 2019, we developed 
a new scorecard that includes the eight pillars of health. We 
planned to implement the new scorecard in 2020, but were 
forced to delay as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our plan 
is to continue with our current scorecard until it is safe to 
increase in-person screening and health activities.  
Fostering a Positive Health and Safety Culture
Building a health and safety culture depends on engaging 
employees at all levels of our organization. We do this through 
our EHS policy and technical and management standards, 
which include the following:
•  Our Risk Assessment and Self-Assessment Management 
Standard, which includes requirements for assessing and 
mitigating health and safety risks
•  Our Training and Awareness Management Standard, which 
includes requirements for employees to be aware of health 
and safety risks and have knowledge of job-specific hazards
•  Our Emergency Preparedness Standard, which sets out 
requirements for emergency preparedness planning
•  Technical standards covering specific areas, such as Fleet 
Safety, Control of Hazardous Energy, Confined Spaces, 
Ergonomics, Electrical Safety, Biological Safety and Working 
at Heights, among others
We updated Abbott’s Emergency Preparedness Standard in 
2018 and launched our new standard in 2019. This standard  
sets out minimum requirements for ensuring people’s health 
and safety at our sites and in the surrounding communities, and 
establishes procedures for Abbott employees to report and 
respond to emergencies. We maintain global policies and standards for 
managing employee health and safety.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      54
The requirements for compliance with the standard include  
the following:
•  Maintaining detailed site descriptions and lists of any 
hazardous chemicals present
•  Identifying potential emergency conditions and the actions 
and clean-up procedures required in response
•  Maintaining emergency response equipment and clearly 
identifying where it is located
•  Identifying a designated emergency coordinator and 
members of the emergency response team
•  Having clear procedures for reporting emergency situations 
and evacuating the site
• Having employee and emergency response team training
•  Performing annual reviews of all emergency preparedness 
procedures
A full list of our EHS management and technical standards is 
available on our website . Details of our training and awareness 
programs of our policies and standards can be found in the 
Environment section on page 63 . 
We strive to operate a workplace that is not only safe and 
healthy but that also fosters well-being and ensures that all 
employees feel engaged. Our occupational health professionals 
conduct regular screenings and health education programs, 
identifying and minimizing occupational risks.Our first aid, weight reduction and stress management 
programs are available to all Abbott employees and Abbott 
contractors in several locations. We also offer team-based 
global competitions throughout the year to encourage employee 
movement and exercise, such as our annual Walk With Friends 
and Exercise Across Abbott campaigns. Additional events are 
also held at site and regional levels.
Strategy 
We have been tracking our health and safety performance 
against two priority safety goals with corresponding 2020 
targets. Our first goal is to reduce the number of incidents that 
result in time off work, as measured by lost-time case rate. Our 
2020 lost-time case rate target was 0.15 per 100 workers, which 
includes employees and contract workers. The second goal  
is to reduce the number of vehicle accidents involving our 
employees, as measured in accidents per million miles 
(APMM). Our 2020 APMM-driven rate target was 4.0.
Our EHS professionals develop programs to drive continuous 
progress toward these targets and provide support to all Abbott 
employees and contract workers, including those who are part 
of recent acquisitions.
Looking to the future, we are working to identify our next- 
generation health and safety targets, and we are implementing 
an occupational health goal to advance focus on worker 
well-being.SUPPORTING HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE 
We operate a broad range of programs, standards and 
initiatives designed to support wellness at work:
•  An ergonomic program through which our EHS 
professionals track injuries, assess the working  
environment and implement solutions 
•  Active-pause programs to encourage stretching during 
the workday, along with targeted initiatives to increase 
flexibility and core strength
•  Global engineering standards for suitable illumination
•  Regular monitoring of noise to ensure exposures are 
below local regulatory limits or the thresholds set by  
the American Conference of Governmental Industrial 
Hygienists (ACGIH), whichever is lower
•  Auditing and preventive maintenance of air filtration 
systems 
•  Global engineering standards for humidification and 
dehumidification
•  Compliance with the standards of the American Society  
of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers 
(ASHRAE) on indoor workplace temperatures

Our 2020 Targets
The lost-time case rate records work-related injuries that 
require days away from work. In 2020, our lost-time case rate 
decreased significantly to its lowest level in 13 years. We believe 
that this reduction is the result of moving our office workers 
and many sales teams to remote working, as well as the 
constraints on travel and other business activities that have 
resulted from the pandemic. Our ultimate objective is the elimination of all work-related 
injuries for Abbott’s employees and contract workers. 
We have developed a global safe-driving program as part of  
our efforts to reduce vehicle accidents across Abbott. EHS 
personnel in each region administer the program, which 
applies to all Abbott businesses and all commercial employees. 
It includes behind-the-wheel and defensive-driving training, 
commentary drives, incident reporting and investigation and 
post-incident coaching.We aim to achieve continuous reductions in APMM through 
our safe-driving program, which promotes safer driving 
behaviors among our field-based employees and raises 
awareness of the dangers of distracted driving, including 
mobile-phone use.
In 2020, this program helped drive a 30% reduction in our 
global APMM to 2.70, Abbott’s lowest rate ever, which is 
significantly better than our 2020 target. The reduction takes 
place in the context of a significant overall reduction in miles 
driven as a result of the pandemic.

Health, Safety and Wellness Performance Updates 
Road Safety
Our U.S. fleet includes around 2,500 leased vehicles, which  
we replace every three years. In 2020, we completed the rollout 
of new vehicle safety features to all commercial vehicles in the 
United States. These features include adaptive cruise control; 
automatic braking; reverse cameras; and collision, lane 
departure and blind-spot warnings.
In an initial study, the accident rate for vehicles equipped with 
these features was 40% lower than the average for our overall 
U.S. fleet. Besides increasing safety for our employees, these 
features have reduced costs to the business resulting from 
vehicle damage and lost-time injuries. In 2020, COVID-19 
positively impacted the accident rate because employees were  
not driving as much as they normally do.
Additionally, as part of our Helmet Observation Program in 
India, Abbott provides two new helmets for every one of our 
sales employees in India—one for the employee and one for any 
pillion rider. The success of this program has played a significant 
role in reducing the severity of injuries during the year.
Protective Equipment During the Pandemic
During the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our businesses were 
essential to customers, and our employees went into buildings 
and facilities to provide support. As a result, Abbott provided 
personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks, gloves, 
face shields, disposable gowns and shoe covers, to field sales 
and service employees to ensure they could safely meet 
customer needs. In addition to PPE, employees were provided  
a safe work practice training on good hygiene practices and 
how to wear PPE. Recordable Case Rate
Besides our priority 2020 targets, Abbott’s EHS Scorecard also 
tracks our recordable case rate. This category of incidents 
includes any work-related injuries resulting in death, days away 
from work, restricted work or transfer to another job, medical 
treatment beyond first aid, loss of consciousness, and significant 
illness or injury diagnosed by a licensed healthcare professional.
Abbott’s recordable case rate decreased from 0.46 in 2019 to 
0.27 in 2020—a decrease of 41%. As with our lost-time case  
rate, this represents our lowest rate in 13 years. The reduction 
reflects the constraints on activity and reduction in driving that 
have resulted from the pandemic. However, they also highlight 
our targeted road safety programs in India and our progress 
integrating Abbott’s EHS standards and policies into our 
recently acquired rapid diagnostics business.
Fatalities 
We are grateful to report that Abbott experienced no fatalities 
among our employees or contractors in 2020. We will continue 
to promote safety and are determined to keep this number at 
zero going forward. Our priority is to incorporate safety 
measures across all aspects of our business, and we have a 
constant commitment to keep our employees healthy and safe. 
Targeting Root Cause of Accidents
Analyses of our health and safety data over recent years shows 
that the major causes of injury among Abbott employees are 
vehicle accidents; slips, trips and falls; and ergonomic-related 
injuries. We have responded to these findings by launching 
targeted programs and awareness campaigns to reduce these 
different injury causes.Occupational Health and Wellness 
We monitor the impact of our health and wellness programs 
through our occupational injury and illness frequency rate, 
which measures reported cases of illness resulting from work, 
including minor cases that require first aid only. Since 2019,  
our occupational illness frequency rate has remained at  
0.1 illnesses reported per million working hours. 
Our global OHS programs aim to address the health and 
well-being of our employees in and out of work. In 2020, our 
occupational health and safety professionals performed more 
than 300,000 COVID-19 tests.
Our approach to case management for Abbott employees 
exposed to or diagnosed with COVID-19 was essential for 
keeping our operations running in 2020. We provided training 
on case management principles to all clinical staff and 
implemented a telephone-based case management program 
globally. All COVID-19 cases were reported to our Global 
Occupational Health Organization, which managed more than 
40,000 cases and reviewed them to identify patterns that we 
could use to reduce the risk of workplace exposure. 
COVID-19 HEALTH PRACTICES
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have 
implemented global standards for social distancing,  
face covering, hand sanitization, prepackaged meal 
services and enhanced facility cleaning. We have also 
implemented regular COVID-19 testing and established  
global case management protocols to manage COVID-19 
cases. These have been successful in limiting  
workplace transmission. OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      57

GOVERNANCE
Abbott’s environment governance and management systems are 
part of an integrated Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) 
approach. Our EHS strategy focuses on identifying and mitigating 
EHS-related risk, ensuring business continuity and addressing 
our stakeholders’ expectations that Abbott is a responsible 
corporate citizen. It includes systems and targets for reducing 
our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and ensuring responsible 
water and waste management.
Abbott’s commitment to sustainable business starts at the top 
and is integrated across our organization. Our Board of 
Directors and senior management lead our sustainability 
activities. The Board’s Public Policy Committee is responsible 
for reviewing and evaluating our policies and practices 
regarding corporate responsibility. Our Global Citizenship 
Advisory Council (GCAC) provides Abbott with guidance on 
strategic sustainability issues, including identifying sustainability 
risks and opportunities. It is made up of independent expert 
advisors and thought leaders in the area of sustainability.
Our EHS management and governance systems ensure that  
we incorporate environmental considerations into our 
day-to-day planning and business processes, with clear lines  
of accountability and senior-level leadership and support.In 2019, our EHS organization began reporting directly to the 
Senior Vice President, Quality Assurance, Regulatory and 
Engineering Services to shorten lines of accountability and 
strengthen senior-level leadership support. The Senior Vice 
President is a senior corporate officer who leads our EHS 
management efforts and reports to our CEO. As part of this role, 
the Senior Vice President is also the executive sponsor for the 
development of Abbott’s next-generation climate and water 
strategy, and played a key role in the development of our 2030 
Sustainability Plan.
We implement our EHS sustainability programs and initiatives 
through four leadership councils, which include representation 
from Abbott’s various businesses and relevant operational areas 
such as engineering, quality and supply chain.
•  The Global Operations Council (GOC) oversees the execution 
of Abbott’s operations strategy in four areas: manufacturing, 
supply chain, engineering and EHS.
•  The Commercial EHS Executive Council sets EHS priorities, 
goals and objectives for our commercial operations, which 
include actions to reduce GHG emissions, as well as key 
health and safety objectives, such as improving driver safety.
•  The EHS Leadership Council establishes the EHS strategy 
and EHS programs; builds awareness, education and 
expertise; and promotes our EHS Awards.
•  The Supply Chain Council identifies key, strategic and  
critical suppliers to engage with to address shared 
sustainability responsibilities and implement initiatives in 
sourcing categories where positive sustainability impacts  
can be made. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT: 
THROUGH THE LENS OF A  
SINGLE PRODUCT
Our 2030 Sustainability Plan focuses on a healthier future, 
including protecting our environment. One of the ways 
we’re reducing our environmental impact is with our 
FreeStyle Libre® continuous glucose-monitoring (CGM) 
system for diabetes care. 
•  Less plastic: the FreeStyle Libre 3 system* has a smaller, 
more discreet sensor and a one-piece applicator, reducing 
the total volume of the sensor by more than 70%. 
•  Zero waste production: One of our sites producing 
FreeStyle Libre, in Witney, England, is also one of Abbott’s 
38 sites that sends zero waste to landfills. All waste is 
recycled, reused, composted or responsibly incinerated. 
•  Reduced emissions: The Witney site has reduced its 
absolute carbon emissions by nearly 20% over the past 
decade, even with increased production.  
•  Engaging consumers: We launched a pilot program for 
people to send back used sensor kits for free, keeping 
them out of landfills.

STRATEGY
Our 2020 Targets 
As part of our EHS strategy, we set 2020 enterprise-level 
targets for reducing our GHG emissions, water use and waste 
against 2010 levels, when adjusted for sales.
These targets were:
•  A 40% reduction in the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) 
emissions associated with our business operations and  
the electricity we purchase (known as Scope 1 and  
Scope 2 emissions)
• A 30% reduction in our total water intake
• A 50% reduction in the total waste we generate
Each Abbott business also sets annual environmental targets 
with our executive leadership, which we track as part of 
Abbott’s quarterly EHS Scorecard. This helps us maintain  
progress toward our 2030 targets and identify areas for 
improvement on a continuous basis. We verify our EHS 
performance data using an independent assurance provider: 
Apex Companies (formerly Bureau Veritas North America).

Policies and Management Systems
We aim to drive continuous improvement in our environmental 
performance through our EHS policy and our management  
and technical standards. We have designed these policies  
and standards to ensure all Abbott operations comply with 
applicable regulations at local, state, national and international 
levels. This includes protecting the environment, health and 
safety of the communities where we operate. 
In December 2020, we updated the Abbott EHS policy that 
expands the focus of our environmental protection from our 
own operations to our entire value chain. Under this new 
policy, we engage with strategic stakeholders and suppliers to 
promote new approaches for reducing our environmental 
impact. The policy also commits us to routinely monitoring our 
value chain for accountability. 
We train all EHS employees in both our standards and 
changing regulatory requirements. Abbott’s employee training 
program includes a module focusing on our EHS standards, and 
we encourage our EHS employees to further their knowledge 
by attending external training courses and conferences.We make all of our EHS policies and standards available on  
our website, including the following:
•  Environment, energy and water policies , which detail our 
environmental commitments to reduce our impact on climate, 
protect human health and recognize water as a critical 
natural resource
•  Corporate environmental guidelines , which direct our 
approach to meeting these commitments
•  Supplier guidelines , which detail our company’s value  
system and principles-based approach to doing business as 
this relates to human rights, labor, the environment and  
ethical behavior
•  Internal EHS audit program, which ensures compliance with 
our EHS policy and drives continuous improvement
Subject-matter experts regularly update Abbott’s EHS policies 
and standards to reflect current and future anticipated best 
practices and regulatory trends, as well as International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) and other regulatory 
requirements. Together, our policies and management practices 
deliver a consistent approach to managing, measuring and 
reducing environmental impacts across our operations.
We operate a comprehensive EHS audit program to ensure 
compliance with Abbott policies and applicable regulatory 
requirements and to identify potential risks to our employees 
and the business. We evaluate EHS risk factors for each site 
annually and use these evaluations to determine how frequently 
audits take place. Once an audit is completed, we develop 
corrective action plans, where required, and monitor how these 
plans are implemented. We use established external standards to guide our actions and 
pursue external certification, where relevant.
•  We consider Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED) certification when building new facilities.
•  Individual Abbott sites or businesses may also pursue 
external certifications, such as ISO, when they identify 
business value in doing so.
By the end of 2020, 48% of Abbott manufacturing and R&D sites 
held environment-related ISO certifications. This included 35 
manufacturing and R&D sites with ISO 14001 and 19 with ISO 
50001 certifications. In addition, eight nonmanufacturing sites 
achieved ISO 14001, and one achieved ISO 50001 certification. 
Similarly, 14 facilities achieved LEED certification, including one 
platinum, six gold and five silver certifications. Combined, these 
facilities represent more than 3.8 million square feet of LEED-
certified buildings.

Our efforts to improve environmental efficiency depend upon 
engaging employees at all levels of our organization through 
policies and initiatives such as:
•  Evaluating our EHS leaders against EHS performance goals 
as part of their annual performance reviews
•  Raising awareness of priority EHS issues through dedicated 
time, highlighting EHS topics and a monthly webinar series 
with subject matter experts and representatives from sites 
with high EHS performance
•  Recognizing exceptional performance by sites, teams and 
individual employees through our annual EHS Awards Program
The EHS Awards Program includes awards for large and small 
manufacturing sites with the best overall EHS performance 
for the year, and awards for outstanding individual and  
team initiatives.
Environmental and Ecosystem Protection
Protecting biodiversity and ecosystems is an important aspect 
of Abbott’s environmental management programs. Many 
Abbott sites have implemented measures to protect the 
functioning of natural ecosystems and promote biodiversity, 
including measures to remediate impacted soil and groundwater, 
protect and restore wetlands and prairies, and remove  
invasive species.
As part of the due diligence we conduct for business and 
property acquisitions, we prepare detailed risk assessments to 
identify known or suspected environmental/ecosystem damage 
and develop strategies to remediate impacted environments 
and protect sensitive ecosystems, like wetlands.Our programs to protect vulnerable and endangered species 
include a long-term initiative to protect the threatened eastern 
prairie fringed orchid. This conservation program focuses  
on 160 acres of undeveloped land owned by Abbott near  
our headquarters in Illinois and involves Abbott volunteers 
hand-pollinating the endangered plants, monitoring bloom 
rates and analyzing the impact of a species of soil fungus on 
successful germination.
Abbott employees are also involved in a range of initiatives  
to develop insect habitats at our sites in North America  
and Europe.
Mergers and Acquisitions
Our updated EHS policy specifies that compliance with  
the policy will be integrated into all Abbott mergers and 
acquisitions. We conduct due diligence to identify and manage 
EHS liabilities associated with company mergers, acquisitions 
and divestitures. The due diligence procedure that we follow 
depends on the nature of the transaction:
1.  We conduct environmental due diligence on all real  
property transactions.
2.  For business acquisitions, we expand our due diligence to 
assess the company’s EHS resources and programs, identify 
gaps, and estimate the costs and resources required to align 
them with Abbott standards.
When Abbott acquires new businesses, we follow a program  
to align those businesses with our EHS management practices 
and standards. We provide all relevant training and resources to 
enable the acquired business to implement our EHS policy and 
standards successfully. We then conduct multiple assessments 
at different stages of the program to ensure the effectiveness of 
our training and the progress made on its implementation.

MANAGING CLIMATE-RELATED  
RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Abbott is committed to identifying and mitigating climate- 
related risks that have the potential to impact our operations, 
supply chain and distribution network. We also have a process 
to identify and act on opportunities to address healthcare  
needs that are emerging as a result of climate change and to 
increase operating efficiencies by reducing our climate-related 
impacts through the management of our emissions, water  
and waste streams.
Through these processes, we have determined that climate- 
related risks and opportunities exist at site and regional levels 
throughout our value chain; however, Abbott is not exposed  
to any substantive climate-related risks or opportunities at a 
global level.
Risks
The risks that we analyze include physical and transitional 
risks that result from emerging regulation and new expectations 
of our businesses and risk exposure through our suppliers and 
customers. We assess and manage these risks through our 
integrated company-wide risk management process, which 
identifies opportunities to build resilience in both our operations 
and our business model.
Abbott regularly updates risk management policies, standards 
and programs to align with global best practices and regulatory 
requirements, and we aim to anticipate emerging risks and 
upcoming regulatory changes.
Our enterprise risk management (ERM) process identifies and 
evaluates the most critical risks for our business and provides 
guidance to our Board of Directors and management team. For 
more information on our ERM approach, please go to the 
Sustainability Overview section on page 17 .In 2017 , the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD), established by the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB), published its recommended framework for 
companies disclosing climate-related risks and mitigation 
strategies. The objective of the framework is to enable 
smarter allocation of investment capital, based on how 
companies address climate issues, and to facilitate the 
transition to a low-carbon economy.
The TCFD framework consists of four core elements: 
governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and 
targets. It includes recommended disclosures that 
companies should make in each of these areas. 
As recommended by the TCFD, we explain where Abbott 
has published information on our climate-related risks and 
approaches to mitigating them, as outlined at right.GOVERNANCE
We’ve included information about our management’s role in 
assessing climate risks and opportunities and our Board’s 
role in overseeing climate change risk management in the 
Governance section on page 61.
STRATEGY
We describe the climate risks and opportunities that  
we have identified, as well as the impacts of these on  
our business, in our latest CDP Climate Change

managing climate-related risks and opportunities on this 
page and the next. Additional details are available in our 
latest CDP Climate Change Disclosure response .
METRICS AND TARGETS
The end of this report (in the Reporting on Sustainability 
section beginning on page 122 ) includes a list of climate-
related metrics that we track and report.TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED

Our EHS governance team monitors emerging climate-related 
trends and regulations to analyze the potential impacts on our 
business, understand our risk exposures and develop appropriate 
management strategies. Our EHS, Economics, Business 
Continuity and Supply Chain organizations use scenario- 
sensitivity risk modeling to understand the financial implications 
of climate-related risks. This has included analyzing potential 
risks resulting from the 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) 
agreements on climate change, carbon taxes, water scarcity and 
the impact of climate change on agricultural supply chains.
Abbott’s Business Continuity and Crisis Management  
organizations implement measures to ensure business 
continuity and minimize the financial impacts of physical 
climate-related risks. These physical risks fall into two 
categories: acute and chronic.
The acute physical risks associated with climate change 
include unforeseen extreme weather events. We cannot 
develop a strategy to prevent such events. However, we have 
developed strategies for mitigating and responding to them 
across our value chain. Our Business Continuity and Crisis 
Management organization works with our EHS, Engineering 
and Supply Chain groups to identify and implement measures 
that will strengthen business resiliency in the face of extreme 
weather events. 
These processes have also served to increase business resiliency 
in the face of other forms of extreme events. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, at a time when flights were grounded  
and many borders closed, our processes enabled us to produce 
millions of COVID-19 tests in a matter of weeks while continuing 
to provide all of our other essential products to people around 
the world. Our Engineering and EHS policies and management standards 
consider chronic physical risks, such as water scarcity, and 
require sites to conduct regular risk and opportunity evaluations 
and implement mitigation strategies.
Our analyses of climate-related risks conclude that Abbott is 
not exposed to physical risks that could generate a substantive 
change in business operations, revenue or expenditure at a 
corporate level. Limited physical risks exist at site and regional 
operation levels and throughout our supply chain. However, 
our diverse geographical distribution significantly mitigates  
the potential for substantive impact on our business.
Our most significant climate-related risks are transition risks 
that relate to emerging expectations and regulations around 
businesses managing their GHG emissions. These risks include 
carbon limits and taxes, enhanced emissions-reporting 
obligations, costs to transition to lower-emissions technologies, 
and increased costs of goods and services.
We have identified the need to manage and mitigate  
environmental impacts as a potential enterprise risk for  
Abbott. In response to this, Abbott’s business strategy includes 
reducing the energy and carbon footprint of our operations  
and engaging our value chain in strategic sourcing categories.
For more information on our management of, and progress in, 
addressing specific climate-related risks, see Reducing Energy 
and Emissions ( page 67), Protecting Water Resources ( page 72 ) 
and Extended Producer Responsibility ( page 77).Opportunities
As part of our product research and development (R&D) and 
climate risk management processes, we consider opportunities 
that might result from climate change. These fall into two  
main categories: increased operating efficiencies as a result  
of achieving carbon reduction targets and the opportunity to 
advance our mission to help people live their best lives by 
meeting changing healthcare and nutrition needs.
Compared with many industries, Abbott’s carbon footprint is 
relatively small, and our success in exceeding our 2020 carbon 
reduction target means that we have fewer opportunities to 
realize significant operating efficiencies and cost savings in the 
future. Although further opportunities in this area exist and are 
incorporated in our 2030 Sustainability Plan, they are unlikely 
to have a substantive financial impact on our business.
Changes to the climate have the potential to influence the 
disease burden and result in increased need for the diagnostics, 
medical devices, nutrition products and pharmaceuticals that 
Abbott makes.
Our 2030 Sustainability Plan commits us to continuing to 
respond to increased humanitarian needs as a result of severe 
weather events, new disease threats and changes in the spread 
of disease. We will do so in line with our priority of innovating 
for access and affordability, which has characterized our 
company’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We do not anticipate that changes to the disease burden as a 
result of climate change will have a substantive financial or 
strategic impact on our business beyond this. We will continue 
to respond to these in line with our caring value and primarily 
through our philanthropic organization and product donations.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      67
REDUCING ENERGY  
AND EMISSIONS
Protecting a healthy environment requires Abbott to continue 
reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, both in our direct operations and throughout our 
value chain.
Abbott’s manufacturing, warehousing, vehicle fleets and office 
activities result in Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) 
emissions. We also contribute to GHG emissions through 
business travel, the way that we dispose of waste, and our 
upstream and downstream value chains. These are known  
as Scope 3 emissions and also include emissions from the 
sourcing, processing and transport of raw materials, the 
distribution of our products, and the way that our products  
and their packaging are used and disposed of.
In 2012, we set an ambitious target to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 40% by 2020, when compared to 2010 and 
adjusted for sales. We exceeded this target in 2019 and 
continued to build on this progress in 2020. By the end of  
the year, we had achieved a 51% reduction compared with  
2010 levels.
2030 Sustainability Targets
Under our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we have set new targets to 
reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% compared 
with our 2018 baseline. This aligns our sustainability plan with 
the objectives of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), 
well below the two-degree Celsius warming scenario.
In addition to this, we are working to develop a 2030 target for 
Scope 3 emissions and will work with our key carbon-intensive 
suppliers to implement sustainable programs to reduce these 
emissions. For more details, see the Supply Chain section on 
page 84 .Our 2030 targets, like those for 2020, will be measured in terms 
of CO2e emissions. They will include all GHG emissions 
covered by the World Resources Institute/World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) methodology for GHG 
reporting. This includes nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur oxide 
(SOx), as well as carbon dioxide (CO2), refrigerants and other 
greenhouse gases.
For details of how we measure and manage Scope 3 GHG 
emissions1 in our value chain, see page 71.Our Energy Policies and Guidelines
We have outlined our program for tracking and reducing 
energy and air emissions in our Climate Responsible Energy 
Policy and Internal Energy Guidelines. Our EHS Council and 
governing documents provide guidance on the following:
• Increasing energy efficiency in our manufacturing operations
• Investing in low-carbon energy
• Improving the efficiency of our transportation fleet
• Encouraging a lower carbon footprint in our supply chain
• Publicly reporting our performance
We work within international commitments and frameworks, 
like CDP and the GHG Protocol, to measure, track, reduce and 
report emissions of GHG emissions, volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) and SOx. Detailed information on our performance is 
on page 131 in the Reporting on Sustainability section.
In 2020, we received a B rating for our CDP Climate Change 
Disclosure response, which represents a drop in performance 
compared with our A- rating in 2019. We have analyzed the 
reasons for this drop in performance and are developing a 
long-term strategy to address them. We also received an A- rating 
for our latest CDP Climate Supplier Engagement response. OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICES

ABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      68
Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions
We have established a comprehensive management program 
for reducing Abbott’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which 
includes purchasing more renewable electricity, increasing 
energy efficiency across our operations, and integrating 
sustainable engineering technologies and concepts into  
our projects.
Each of Abbott’s businesses and divisions sets annual energy 
efficiency targets. In addition, all manufacturing sites that 
produce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of more than 25,000 
metric tons of CO2e annually are required to set annual carbon 
reduction goals.
Our three most significant areas of climate change impact are 
our electricity use, fuel consumption by our manufacturing 
operations and our global sales fleet. Together, these represent 
93% of the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions associated with our 
direct operations.2
We have exceeded our 40% emissions reduction target for 2020 
by reducing our emissions by 51% since 2010, normalized to 
sales. This equates to a 29% reduction on an absolute basis 
compared to 2010 levels and a 5.8% reduction since 2019. For 
more details, see pages 129–131 and 133–135 in the Reporting on 
Sustainability section.
We verify all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions through a 
third-party assurance process.OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT
Scope 3 emissions related to waste from operations and 
downstream transportation and distribution were found  
to be marginal, contributing to less than 1% of Abbott’s 
greenhouse gas emissions.We are committed to reducing our carbon emissions, and we  
encourage our suppliers, distributors and other stakeholders to reduce 
their own impacts.

Using Cleaner Sources of Energy
We anticipate that the majority of the reductions in GHG 
emissions under our 2030 Sustainability Plan will be achieved 
by Abbott purchasing a greater proportion of our electricity 
from renewable energy sources. We are currently developing a 
Renewable Energy Procurement initiative to drive continuous 
improvement in this area.
Since 2017 , our greatest carbon reductions were achieved 
through the purchase of electricity from utility providers  
that included above-average renewable generation in their 
energy mix, particularly in Europe. We purchased 170 million 
kilowatt-hours of low-carbon energy in 2020. This resulted  
in savings of 78,000 metric tons of CO2e.We aim to further reduce Abbott’s GHG emissions by investing 
in low-carbon fuels, cogeneration and renewable energy 
generation at our facilities. In 2020, six of our facilities used 
cogeneration units, which are power-generating units that 
produce electricity and capture heat for use in manufacturing 
processes. We produced 59 million kilowatt-hours of electricity 
through cogeneration in 2020, an increase of 68% since 2010. 
In total, we generated 1.5 million kilowatt-hours of energy at 
our sites, mostly through solar panels. 
For a detailed breakdown of our energy footprint and  
performance, see pages 131–132 and 136–138 in the Reporting  
on Sustainability section.
Our 2020 Targets
In addition to our focus on using cleaner sources of energy, we 
remain committed to reducing energy use across our operations 
and reducing the energy demands that our business makes.
Each Abbott business and site has developed energy efficiency 
programs to help meet our Scope 1 and Scope 2 reduction 
targets. These programs have been successful in decreasing our 
absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 29% from 2010 to 2020, 
despite continual increases in production during this time.
In 2020, we implemented 54 energy efficiency and air 
emissions projects at 28 manufacturing and R&D sites in nine 
countries. These projects resulted in more than $1.1 million 
annual cost savings and more than 30 million kilowatt-hours in 
annual energy savings, preventing more than 8,900 metric tons 
of CO2e emissions. In several cases, we achieved significant 
savings by upgrading and optimizing building control 
technologies, HVAC systems, and manufacturing processes  
and equipment.Fuel-Efficient Initiatives
We have launched a number of long-term initiatives to manage 
fuel consumption in our commercial fleet, which contributed  
to 25% of our Scope 1 emissions in 2020. These initiatives 
include requirements for more fuel-efficient vehicles and 
car-sharing programs. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our sales teams worked from 
home for several months, with the exception of those providing 
necessary support to hospitals. This resulted in a significant 
reduction in fuel consumption for our commercial fleet and 
contributed to a reduction in Scope 1 emissions. Offsetting this, 
disruption caused by the pandemic meant that we could rely 
less on our most fuel-efficient modes of transportation when it 
came to delivering COVID-19 tests and other Abbott products 
when and where they were needed. For more details, see the

Regulated Air Emissions
The production of some Abbott products involves substances 
that are ozone-depleting or classified as hazardous or toxic air 
pollutants (HAPs) by the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA). We require all Abbott facilities using these substances  
to take all necessary steps to ensure the protection of human 
health and the environment. This includes adhering to all 
applicable regulations, as well as to Abbott technical standards. 
Our Supplier Guidelines establish that the same standards are 
expected of all Abbott suppliers.
Abbott prohibits the use of certain hazardous substances across 
all operations and continually evaluates new toxicological 
information, regulatory changes and alternatives to substances 
that are identified as hazardous. Scope 3 Emissions
Our Scope 3 emissions are an estimated 12 times larger than our 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions combined. They include all indirect 
emissions associated with our upstream and downstream value 
chain. We calculate these Scope 3 emissions annually using  
the GHG Protocol, and we verify the emissions related to our 
business travel and operational waste processing through a 
third-party assurance process.
Of the 15 categories of Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with 
the supply, distribution and consumption of products, 10 apply 
to Abbott’s business. (See Our Carbon Footprint on page 68 for 
a breakdown of our Scope 3 emissions.) Since 2010, we have reduced the Scope 3 emissions associated 
with the processing of our operational waste by 39%. This is  
a result of reducing overall waste by 22% and waste sent to 
landfill by 48%, since 2010. Under our 2030 Sustainability Plan, 
we will work with Abbott’s carbon-intensive suppliers on 
programs to reduce our Scope 3 carbon emissions, and we  
are developing a target for these reductions.
We describe how we currently engage suppliers to reduce their 
Scope 3 emissions on pages 95–96 .

PROTECTING WATER RESOURCES
Abbott recognizes that water is a critical natural resource 
essential to sustaining life, human health, economic growth and 
ecosystems. It is also essential to Abbott’s business continuity 
and manufacturing operations and plays a critical role in the 
use of many of our products.
We are committed to managing our water use in an efficient, 
responsible manner, as well as to improving access to clean 
water for our customers and for the communities where  
we operate.Context-Based Approach
We are leveraging our Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) 
membership and resources and World Resources Institute 
(WRI) resources to develop a context-based approach to water 
management that monitors water impacts across the water 
catchment basin we operate in and source from. This delivers  
a better understanding of our business’s water-related risks  
and enables us to mitigate these risks and ensure business 
continuity in the communities where we operate and also 
across our value chain.
A context-based approach to water management is important 
because water issues are wide-ranging, from water scarcity to 
flooding, including localized issues that affect both the business 
and customers. Our approach ensures we invest in what and 
where it matters when it comes to water resources.
Our approach to water management is based on four core 
principles, which are communicated across our business 
through Abbott’s Water Policy on Access to Clean Water and 
our internal Water Use Guidelines:
•  Using a context-based water-management approach that 
considers our water impacts across our value chain in 
water-stressed areas 
•  Preventing adverse impacts to human health and the 
environment resulting from our water use and discharge
•  Engaging stakeholders across our value chain to encourage 
the latest water management principles
•  Educating employees, suppliers and customers about the 
importance of protecting water resourcesSome Abbott sites have regulations governing direct water 
discharges, which include specific provisions to ensure that  
any discharge does not harm water quality or people’s health. 
The vast majority of water that Abbott discharges goes directly 
to municipal plants for treatment prior to direct discharge to  
a waterway.
In addition to partnering with various water stakeholders, 
Abbott has participated in the CDP Water Disclosure Program 
since 2010. This has allowed us to share critical water performance 
data while benchmarking our performance and programs 
against those of other companies in the healthcare sector, as 
well as against those of global leaders in water management.
2030 Sustainability Targets
We have aligned our 2030 Sustainability Plan and our water 
management technical standard, which governs our operational 
water management, with the principles of a context-based 
approach. Our Sustainability Plan includes the following 
water-related targets for 2030:
•  Achieve water stewardship certification at all high-water 
impact manufacturing sites in water-stressed areas
•  Implement accredited water stewardship management 
practices in more than 75% of all manufacturing sites 
operating in water-stressed areas
•  Work with 50 key suppliers in high water-stressed areas  
to reduce risks to water quality and quantity for Abbott and 
the communityOVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICES

Water Risk Management
Abbott is committed to identifying and mitigating climate  
and water-related risks that have the potential to impact our 
operations, supply chain and distribution network. 
We have a process for identifying and acting on opportunities 
to address healthcare needs that are emerging as a result of 
climate change and water-related activities. These processes, 
which include Abbott’s enterprise risk management and 
business continuity organizations, are outlined in the Managing 
Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities section on page 65 .
Through our water-management technical standard, we 
monitor our impact on water resources in the communities 
where we operate and assess water-related risks at the basin 
level and across our value chain. We also work with community 
stakeholders and within our own operations to reduce 
water-related risks.We identify manufacturing and R&D sites that use more  
than 50 million gallons of water annually, as well as sites that 
operate in water-stressed areas, and then develop and implement 
site-specific water-management plans. These plans include 
site-level targets that mitigate water-related risks to our 
operations and in the communities where we operate.
Our water-management technical standard identifies three 
categories of manufacturing and R&D sites that require 
water-management plans. These categories are the following:
1.  Significant water users
2. Significant water users that operate in water-stressed areas
3.  Sites that operate in water-stressed areas but are not 
significant water users
In addition to developing a water-management plan, sites in the 
first two categories must engage with key stakeholders in their 
local catchment basins to identify and address water-related 
risks and challenges. 
Abbott assesses the water resilience of all our sites annually  
by evaluating local water stress and intensity of water use.  
We leverage WRI Aqueduct™, a global water-risk mapping  
tool, to identify Abbott sites that are exposed to water stress. 
We also consider the potential for water-related risks for any 
acquisitions and site-expansion projects.
In 2020, 28 of our 112 manufacturing and R&D sites operated  
in water-stressed regions. However, more than 54% of the sites 
in water-stressed areas each used less than 15 million gallons  
of water. This minimized Abbott manufacturing and R&D site 
exposure to water risk, and minimized our impacts in the 
water-stressed areas where we operate.Our annual water stress mapping and analysis also help assess 
levels of water-related risk for Abbott as a whole. Our analysis 
finds that, while water is a key resource for manufacturing, 
Abbott is not exposed to significant chronic physical water- 
related risks at the corporate level. Interruption of water 
supply to any single manufacturing site or locale would have a 
local impact. However, operating contingencies and geographic 
diversification limit the potential impact of these risks on 
Abbott’s overall business.

Our Water Footprint
Each year, we map our water footprint to understand where the 
water that we consume comes from, how it is discharged and 
treated, and the impacts that we have on our local water basins. 
In 2017 , we began collecting water source, discharge and 
on-site recycling data for our manufacturing and R&D sites  
to better understand the details of our water footprint. 
We define water recycling as the act of processing used water 
and wastewater through an additional operating cycle or cycles 
before final treatment and discharge into the environment. In 
general, Abbott facilities carry out three types of water 
recycling and reuse: 
•  Wastewater recycled for use in the same process cycle 
•  Wastewater recycled and reused in a different process but 
within the same facility 
•  Wastewater reused at another of the organization’s facilities 
When reporting water recycling data, we calculate the volume 
of recycled or reused water as the volume of water intake that 
has been avoided through recycling or reuse.OUR WATER FOOTPRINT

Our 2020 Targets
We have met our target to reduce Abbott’s total water intake by 
30% by 2020, when compared with 2010 and adjusted for sales. 
At the end of 2020, we had reduced our water intake compared  
with 2010 by 4.1% on an absolute basis and 34% when adjusted 
for sales. We have achieved this by implementing water-efficient 
interventions in our operations and processes, using more 
water-efficient technologies, changing our manufacturing and 
maintenance processes, and recycling water.
Abbott’s total water intake in 2020 was 3.49 billion gallons,  
a 2% decrease compared with 2019. In 2020, we recycled  
and reused 17% of water at sites employing water recycling 
practices. In addition, the number of facilities with  
water recycling activities also increased from 25 to 29.
In 2020, we implemented 16 water efficiency and reduction 
projects at 12 manufacturing and R&D sites across six 
countries, four of which operate in water-stressed areas.  
These projects included technology and process modifications, 
landscaping that reduces watering requirements and uses 
smart irrigation technologies, and recycling water in our 
building and manufacturing operations. Together, the projects 
implemented in 2020 resulted in a savings of $120,000 and  
14.6 million gallons of water per year.
In 2020, we received a B rating for our CDP Water Disclosure 
response , consistent with our rating of B in 2019. This aligns 
Abbott with the global average of all the businesses in our 
activity group. For detailed information on our water 
management performance, see pages 140–143 in the  
Reporting on Sustainability section.2020 WATER REDUCTION HIGHLIGHTS

EXTENDED PRODUCER  
RESPONSIBILITY
Abbott recognizes our extended responsibility for the impact  
of our products on human health and the environment, which 
includes how we procure materials and services to produce 
them and their impact after we distribute them.
We are committed to minimizing the impact of our products 
throughout their entire life cycle. Besides reducing our overall 
environmental impact, this enables us to improve operating 
efficiency and reduce product and operational costs. Our 
commitment considers all components of our business value 
chain, including:
•  Procuring all of our operational inputs, such as raw materials, 
processed goods and services, ethically and sustainably
•  Designing, producing and distributing our products with 
consideration for their impact on the environment and 
human health throughout their life cycle
•  Ensuring that our products can be consumed and disposed  
of in an environmentally responsible manner 
Waste management plays a central role in our vision of 
extended producer responsibility, and our waste management 
approach addresses two critical aspects of this:
•  Operational waste management, which governs the fate and 
treatment of waste that Abbott produces, as well as waste 
diversion in a circular-economy context
•  Reducing the life-cycle impacts of our products and  
their packagingAbbott has adopted a circular-economy approach as the 
objective of our operational waste-management strategy, and 
the targets that we have set as part of our 2030 Sustainability 
Plan reflect this.
2030 Sustainability Targets
Our targets for 2030 include:
•  Addressing 50 million pounds of packaging through high- 
impact sustainable design programs that do the following:
–  Employ circularity principles through smart design and 
material selection
– Eliminate and reduce materials
– Improve the energy efficiency of Abbott’s products
– Optimize packaging, pallet and truckload efficiency
•  Reducing waste impacts using a circular-economy approach 
to achieve and maintain at least a 90% waste-diversion rate
•  Engaging with key suppliers to reduce the environmental 
impact of materials supplied to Abbott that become waste  
in our operationsCircular Economy
The principles of the circular economy provide an alternative 
to the traditional linear economy, in which products are made, 
used and then disposed of. In a circular economy, all resources 
remain in use for as long as possible without becoming waste, 
extracting maximum value from them. This not only reduces 
waste generation but also reduces the requirement for new raw 
material inputs.
Our waste-management strategy and 2030 targets commit us  
to finding ethical, economical and efficient ways to reduce the 
volume and hazardous characteristics of our waste and to 
ensure proper waste-disposal practices. However, it also goes 
further, with a commitment to maximizing the recovery of 
resources and improving operating efficiency while reducing 
our environmental risks and impacts.
We measure our performance in each of these areas and have 
standards, guidelines and programs to reduce the risk associated 
with waste generation, waste handling and waste disposal.
The majority of the waste that Abbott generates is nonhazardous. 
We prioritize reducing the proportion of our waste footprint 
that is classified as hazardous. Since 2010, hazardous waste has 
consistently made up about 13% of our waste footprint. In 2020, 
hazardous waste made up about 17% of our waste. This increase 
was the result of a one-time site expansion construction project 
that negatively impacted hazardous waste.HOLISTIC APPROACH TO REDUCE

Circular Approach to Waste Management
The technical standard governing our operational waste- 
management practices strives to minimize waste generation, 
reduce toxicity and ensure the maximum recovery of the 
economic value of waste. It applies to both hazardous and 
nonhazardous waste, as well as our beneficial-use activities. 
Beneficial use is when a material that otherwise would have 
been waste is reused in substantially the same form to replace  
a commercial product or commodity. 
Our standard specifies a range of waste-management strategies, 
including the following: 
•  Preventive maintenance and process design to eliminate 
waste generation 
•  Process waste reduction through diagnosing and fixing 
problems that would otherwise result in waste generation 
•  Reducing waste through product design, material input and 
purchasing decisions 
•  Partnering across other value chains to promote beneficial use
• Ensuring proper waste material segregation 
• Recycling and incinerating with energy recovery
 CIRCULAR-ECONOMY APPROACH TO OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT
88.5% of waste and beneficial-use materials produced in our operations  
are diverted from landfill and incineration without energy recovery.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICES

Zero Waste to Landfill
In 2012, we launched a Zero Waste to Landfill program to provide 
our sites with a clear target for diverting waste away from 
landfills. In total, 31 Abbott manufacturing facilities and seven  
nonmanufacturing facilities, located across 18 countries, have 
now achieved Zero Waste to Landfill status. Besides reducing 
waste, the program also cuts GHG emissions, saves costs, helps 
to engage employees in our environmental initiatives and motivates 
sites to direct waste to higher levels of waste management. 
Our technical standard for evaluating and approving waste 
vendors mandates ethical and responsible approaches to waste 
management and is designed to minimize risks associated with 
any waste that we dispose of. For manufacturing sites that 
produce more than 1,200 kilograms of hazardous waste 
annually, our Waste Vendor Assessment program requires 
on-site audits of our waste management firms at least every  
five years. This program has assessed 807 waste vendors within 
the last five years and 172 waste vendors in 2020. 
We work with our waste vendors to ensure they employ the 
most efficient and responsible disposal techniques in the 
management of our waste. 
Our IT standard for evaluating and approving electronic-waste 
vendors is used to ensure that responsible recycling of IT waste 
and controls are in place for resale of viable assets. Our 
electronic equipment reuse and recycling program recycled  
162 U.S. tons and resold 61 U.S. tons of electronic equipment in 
2020. Our IT program supports our waste strategy of keeping 
materials in use and reducing raw material inputs by reusing or 
recycling IT-related materials and waste.
See the Supply Chain section on page 101 for more details about 
our waste management in our value chain.

Managing Hazardous and Chemical Waste
Abbott’s hazardous-waste management program is governed  
by our internal waste management standard, which also covers 
the disposal of chemical waste. The standard includes specific 
requirements for storing, segregating, labeling and documenting 
hazardous waste, and for biohazardous waste to be decontaminated 
prior to final disposal. It also requires that all Abbott employees 
and contract workers undertake hazardous-waste management 
training before undertaking responsibility for hazardous-waste 
management, and for this training to be completed annually.
Our Operational Waste Footprint
Waste management is a priority for our business. Managing our 
waste to higher levels of disposition (including incineration with 
energy, recycling and beneficial use), where we keep materials  
in use and extract additional value from waste and our materials, 
is part of that commitment. Ultimately, we are also focused on 
designing out waste and reducing the burden on raw materials.
The chart on this page shows our operational-waste footprint  
in detail, including how waste from our own operations is 
diverted from landfills and how we seek to ensure energy 
recovery from any incineration of our waste.MORE THAN 59% OF THE MATERIALS THAT ABBOTT GENERATES

Our 2020 Targets
In 2020, we produced 66,847 tons of waste, an absolute decrease 
of 5% compared with 2019. Since 2010, we have reduced our total 
waste footprint by 22% on an absolute basis and by 47% when 
adjusted for sales, nearly achieving our 2020 50% reduction target. 
In 2020, we produced 11,175 tons of hazardous waste, an increase 
of 32% compared with 2019. This increase was the result of a 
one-time site construction project that negatively impacted 
hazardous waste. In partnership with our global electronic-  
waste partners, we recycled 162 tons and resold 61 tons of 
electronic equipment. 
Through our efforts to maximize the economic value of material 
over time, we diverted 88.5% of our operational waste and 
beneficial-use materials from landfills and incineration without 
energy recovery. In 2020, our beneficial-use activities exceeded 
the total waste that Abbott generated by 59.9%, with 106,917 tons 
of materials beneficially used from 88 sites in 26 countries. This 
included composting 1,146 tons of cafeteria waste.

SUSTAINABLE LIFE CYCLES WITH 
PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING
Many different Abbott functions work together to incorporate 
sustainability considerations into the design of our products 
and packaging to improve sustainability throughout the 
product life cycle. When possible, we prioritize the following 
considerations in the design and manufacture of our products 
and packaging: 
• Choosing sustainable and renewable materials 
•  Optimizing design to reduce the use of materials and increase 
volumetric efficiency in shipping and storage 
• Designing products to be more energy efficient
•  Designing products that can be circulated back into the 
economy through reuse and recycling
Our 2020 Targets
Abbott’s cross-functional Packaging Council set an aggressive 
target to reduce the total weight of packaging for Abbott products 
by 10% by 2020, when compared with our 2010 baseline. We 
surpassed this initial goal in 2017 and continued to build on our 
progress through 2020. By the end of 2020, we had reduced our 
total weight of packaging by 14.2% compared with 2010. Through 
this achievement, we have eliminated approximately 42.1 million 
pounds of packaging and saved more than $100 million  
since 2010. Engaging and partnering with our suppliers has played a vital 
role in achieving our 2020 packaging target and mitigating the 
environmental impacts associated with Abbott’s extended 
value chain.
We work closely with our suppliers on sustainable packaging 
solutions that seek either to eliminate packaging materials 
supplied to us or to ensure that packaging can be reused in  
our manufacturing processes. This has involved optimizing 
packaging design to reduce material quantities and improve 
shipping efficiencies, increasing the sustainability of fiber- 
based packaging, reducing the use of plastic, and implementing 
reusable packaging and packaging take-back initiatives. Responsible Sourcing and Product Stewardship
Our Product Stewardship, Supply Chain, R&D, Engineering  
and EHS groups work together to identify and mitigate the 
life-cycle impacts of our products and packaging along our 
value chain. This includes analyzing how we source energy, 
transportation and distribution, active pharmaceutical 
ingredients and chemicals of environmental concern, packaging, 
agriculture, dairy, electronics and waste management. For more 
information about our supply chain efforts, see the Supply 
Chain section on page 84 .
Product Stewardship
We have developed a product stewardship program to 
minimize the impact of our products and their packaging 
throughout the product life cycle. The program tracks and 
addresses regulations regarding restricted chemicals and 
ensures due diligence regarding conflict minerals. We carefully 
monitor and document regulatory changes, and we inform  
all areas of our company about the potential business impacts 
of these changes through regular product stewardship  
business meetings.
Our enhanced Regulatory Intelligence process not only ensures 
potential impacts are identified, but also tracks proactive 
actions taken at the business level to ensure compliance. 
We offer product stewardship training on conflict minerals, 
medical device regulations and substances of concern. We also 
offer training to relevant teams on the use of our global data 
composition repository. These teams include R&D, Supply 
Chain, Procurement and EHS. CUMULATIVE PACKAGING REDUCTION

Hazardous Chemicals
Responding to regulations on hazardous chemicals is a key 
element of our product stewardship program, with significant 
implications for how our products can be used, recycled  
and disposed of. We ensure that the way Abbott products are 
marketed and sold always complies with current regulations 
and not just the regulations in place at the time they  
were developed.
Conflict Minerals
We have defined a due-diligence process for understanding the 
use and sourcing of conflict minerals in our products and our 
supply chain. This includes the 3TG minerals: tantalum, tin, 
tungsten and gold.
We file a Form SD3 and Conflict Minerals Report each year with 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in compliance 
with the Dodd-Frank Act. The form, report and our position 
statement on conflict minerals can be found on our website .  
We are a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative,  
which provides companies with tools and resources to support 
compliant, responsible sourcing from conflict-affected and 
high-risk areas.
We use the Responsible Minerals Initiative’s standardized 
Conflict Minerals Reporting Template to survey our suppliers 
on conflict minerals. We also use an automated conflict 
minerals analysis tool to help assess risk in our supply chain.ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENT 
AND COMPLIANCE
Abbott believes that our operations comply in all material 
respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning 
environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state 
environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions 
and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing 
operations. 
Abbott’s capital and operating expenditures for pollution 
control in 2020 were not material. We collect data on capital 
and operating expenditures related to environmental matters 
from all sites where this spending exceeds approximately  
$1 million. In 2020, these sites reported operating expenditures 
for pollution control to be approximately $30 million and 
capital expenditures for pollution control to be approximately 
$5 million. 
Abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible 
parties in investigations and/or remediations at several 
locations in the United States. Under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 
commonly known as Superfund, Abbott is also engaged in 
remediation at several other sites, in cooperation with the  
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar agencies.
It is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related 
to Superfund and remediation activities. However, Abbott 
believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to 
maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
concerning environmental protection, should not have a 
material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash 
flows or results of operations.1. Scope 3 GHG emissions include 15 categories, 10 of which are applicable  
to Abbott and quantified using the methodologies outlined in the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/WRI GHGP 
Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.
2. Scope 1 and 2 emissions were calculated using the World Resources 
Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). To calculate our Scope 2 
emissions, we use the GHGP market-based methodology. Where market- 
based information is not available, location-based results have been used  
as a proxy. For full details on our carbon emissions, including market- and 
location-based calculations, please see pages 129–131 and 133–135 in the 
Reporting on Sustainability section.

SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE IN A TIME  
OF DISRUPTION
In 2020, the world needed urgent new answers to battle the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
We answered the call, developing a broad portfolio of tests to 
confront the virus in different ways. We accomplished in months 
what traditionally takes years. But just creating the tests wasn’t 
enough. We also had to manufacture and distribute them in 
massive quantities. 
Getting tests to people who needed them required a comprehensive 
effort. Securing supplies. Scaling up manufacturing. Quickly 
expanding distribution. The key to making it a reality was the 
strength and resilience of our supply chain.Our intricate global network—approximately 70,000 suppliers  
in 145 countries—enables us to get our life-changing technologies  
into the hands of the millions of people around the world who 
need them, when they need them. With a supply chain this 
sweeping, even small disruptions can have a major impact.  
And the COVID-19 pandemic tested it in ways few have ever 
seen. We were prepared, thanks to our long-time commitment  
to reinforcing the continuity and flexibility of our supply chain. 
We established new railway routes for transporting our essential 
medicines from our established pharmaceuticals business.We quickly ramped up three new production facilities for 
COVID-19 tests, sourced the needed materials for the tests and  
pulled in hundreds of employees from businesses across the 
company to ensure we had enough people to do the work.
All of this was made possible by outstanding management of  
our robust supply chain—the resilience of which helped us avoid 
significant disruptions in a very challenging year.

Lead responsibility for Abbott’s supply chain sits with our 
Chief Procurement Officer, who is part of the Global Operations 
Council (GOC) and reports directly to the Chief Financial  
Officer. The Chief Procurement Officer is supported by  
dedicated procurement leaders who specialize in a number  
of sourcing categories.  
Abbott’s Supply Chain Council (SCC) oversees the development 
of our global supply chain strategy, meeting quarterly and 
reporting regularly to the GOC. The SCC consists of senior 
leaders with responsibility for the supply chain of each Abbott 
business. These leaders report to the Head of Operations for their 
respective businesses. The SCC makes recommendations on the 
vision and targets for achieving a sustainable and resilient supply 
chain. It also leads the development of a consistent global 
approach to identifying and managing sustainability risks and 
opportunities across our value chain. 
Several additional Abbott committees and teams support the 
SCC in its work to improve the adaptability, resilience and 
flexibility of our supply chain:
•  The Supplier Diversity Governance Council is responsible for 
growing a strong, diverse supplier base and has appointed 
supplier diversity champions in every Abbott business and 
major category of spending. 
•  Abbott’s Executive Crisis Management Team (ECMT) is 
responsible for managing risks to business continuity in 
Abbott’s supply chain. The ECMT is supported by our Global 
Security organization and a network of 32 country-specific 
crisis action teams.
•  The Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Leadership

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Our management approach emphasizes the importance of 
sustainability, resilience and flexibility in our supply chain.  
We work closely with our suppliers on solutions to support  
the delivery of our life-changing technologies, reduce our 
environmental and social impacts, enable innovation and 
multiply the social and economic value that we create. The  
SCC has established multiple initiatives to embed sustainability 
as a key element in our supplier engagements.
These initiatives enable us to manage risks systematically, 
identify opportunities to reduce our shared impacts and 
enhance the sustainability of Abbott’s global business.Supply Chain and Procurement Strategy
For Abbott, a sustainable supply chain means ensuring that 
everything we make, and that others make for us, is sourced  
and produced in an ethical manner while minimizing our 
shared sustainability impact. We integrate sustainability 
considerations into our process for selecting and managing  
our suppliers, including into the five objectives of our supply 
chain and procurement strategy: 
•  Ensure our supply network aligns with, protects and elevates 
our brand 
•  Create relationships that deliver shared value by conducting 
business with transparency and trust 
•  Enhance margins and elevate financial performance by 
optimizing total cost, balancing risk with return and certainty 
•  Expedite growth and drive innovation through proprietary 
and exclusive opportunities
•  Design a flexible, dynamic supply network, driving service 
with value and quality without supply risk 
We develop supplier contracts that embed standards aligned 
with our sustainability objectives and require suppliers to 
uphold the principles outlined in our Supplier Guidelines . 
Abbott’s Procurement team spans geographies, organizations 
and business functions. It follows the principles of focus, 
discipline, creativity and community in seeking to form 
innovative and strategic supplier partnerships. Embedding 
sustainability expertise within our supply chain and  
procurement functions is a key element of our approach.
Abbott achieved our goal for 100% of our more than 1,300 Global 
Procurement professionals to be trained in supplier diversity 
and sustainability, requiring this training to be completed by  
all existing and new employees in 2020.OUR SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN
We update our Supplier Guidelines to align with evolving 
global expectations, including the UN Global Compact 
and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI).
We build transparency and resilience through improving 
supply chain business continuity, developing real-time 
visibility and monitoring, and performing scenario 
analysis.
We maintain a formal process for assessing supplier risk  
and compliance with our Social Responsibility Guidelines 
by surveying suppliers on social and environmental  
sustainability issues.
We ensure a diverse supply chain that secures inclusion 
of diverse suppliers to drive economic growth in  
North America.
We engage high-sustainability-risk and key suppliers to 
reduce shared sustainability impacts through strategic 
supply chain initiatives (including priority areas, such as 
labor, human rights, environment and anti-corruption).
We create competitive advantage with sustainability 
through partnering with our suppliers to redesign 
products and services across the value chain and to

Guidelines, Standards and Policies
As a responsible corporate citizen, Abbott is committed to 
supporting and applying the fundamental principles of human 
rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption to ensure 
long-term business success, as well as improving lives around  
the world.
Abbott’s Supplier Guidelines document the principles, 
standards and expectations for establishing and maintaining  
a business relationship with Abbott. As an extension of our 
business, we expect our suppliers to share our dedication to 
these principles by incorporating them into strategies, policies 
and procedures, and establishing a culture of integrity. 
Our guidelines define the minimum standards that we expect  
of our suppliers and that we expect our suppliers to maintain  
in their own supply chains when conducting business with  
our company. In 2020, we updated our supplier guidelines to 
embed a clear focus around ethics, human rights and labor, 
health and safety, the environment and management systems. Abbott’s Supplier Guidelines reflect the Ten Principles of the 
UN Global Compact and the PSCI Principles for Responsible 
Supply Chain Management. By incorporating the Ten Principles 
of the UN Global Compact into strategies, policies and 
procedures, and by maintaining a culture of integrity, Abbott  
and our suppliers are not only upholding their basic  
responsibilities to people and the planet, but are also setting  
the stage for long-term success.
Suppliers are responsible for confirming their compliance and 
providing relevant training to their employees in order to meet 
our standards. We monitor compliance with these guidelines 
through our Supplier Responsibility Program and contracting 
process, and we work with suppliers to improve their  
performance, where required.
We make our Supplier Guidelines available in multiple languages 
on our website. To read Abbott’s Supplier Guidelines in their 
entirety, visit our website . 
In addition to the Supplier Guidelines, we also use the 
following guidelines and policies to embed sustainability 
considerations into our supply chain management:
•  Our Green Procurement Guidelines incorporate the principle 
of environmentally preferable products, which guide our 
sourcing team on identifying environmentally preferable 
choices and asking our suppliers to provide these options. 
•  Our Water Guidelines require transparency from our 
suppliers about their water management practices and  
aim to establish sustainable water management throughout 
our supply chain. •  Our Climate Responsible Energy Guidelines encourage 
suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint and improve  
energy efficiency. 
•  The Abbott Supplier Diversity Policy commits our organization 
to equal opportunities for businesses that are small or  
are majority-owned and operated by a member of an 
underrepresented group (for example, women, ethnic 
minorities, veterans, members of the LGBTQ+ community  
or individuals with a disability). Goal achieved.SUPPLIER DIVERSITY AND

Conducting Business in an Ethical Manner
Our guidelines require that all suppliers conduct their business 
in an ethical manner, act with integrity and comply with all 
legal and regulatory requirements. This includes complying 
with all applicable legal requirements and industry codes, 
encouraging workers to report concerns or illegal activities, 
ensuring that animals are treated humanely, tracking and 
reporting on the presence and use of conflict minerals, and 
safeguarding the use of personal information. 
Human Rights and Labor
Our Supplier Guidelines require that all suppliers are committed 
to protecting and upholding the internationally proclaimed 
human rights of workers, including treating workers with 
dignity and respect, making sure that suppliers are not 
complicit in human rights abuses and that they comply with  
all legal and regulatory requirements pertaining to human 
rights and labor practices.
Ensuring Worker Health and Safety
Our Supplier Guidelines require that suppliers provide a 
secure, safe and healthy workplace, minimizing exposure  
to accidents, injury and health risks, and comply with all legal 
and regulatory requirements. Our guidelines apply to protecting 
workers in the workplace and also in any living quarters and 
vehicles that suppliers provide.
Embedding Environmental Standards
Our guidelines specify that suppliers shall operate in an 
environmentally responsible and efficient manner to minimize 
adverse impacts on the environment. We expect suppliers  
to be transparent in embedding environmental management 
principles into their operations, with systems in place for safe 
handling, movement, storage, recycling, reuse or management 
of waste, air emissions and wastewater discharges.We also expect suppliers to engage in initiatives to promote  
a circular-economy approach to help reduce waste through 
continued use of resources, conserve natural resources, avoid 
the use of hazardous materials and encourage the development 
and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.We require suppliers in certain high-risk categories to have 
certified environmental management systems in place. These 
categories include third-party manufacturers, suppliers of 
active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and chemicals of 
environmental concern, and waste vendors.

SUPPLIER RISK ASSESSMENT  
AND ENGAGEMENT 
Selecting and Classifying Suppliers
When selecting our suppliers, we consider environmental, 
social and governance factors, in addition to a supplier’s 
business capabilities and capacities, financial health and 
strategic alignment with Abbott’s vision. We use supplier 
classification models to identify the levels of risk and shared 
sustainability impacts involved in each supplier relationship.
Our Approved Suppliers List categorizes all Abbott suppliers as 
either high (critical), medium or low risk. We classify a supplier 
as critical if it supplies materials, components and services that 
can influence the safety and performance of our products; if the 
supplier is the only approved source for materials, components 
and services; or if it is otherwise integral to business continuity.
We also consider the degree of transparency and complexity 
involved in a specific supply chain, whether a supplier is 
certified to one of several certification schemes, including, but 
not limited to International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) 14001 or 50001; how close the supplier’s position is to  
our customers in the supply chain; and whether there is the 
potential for a supplier counterfeiting our products.
Our contracts include provisions for supplier transparency  
and require Tier 1 suppliers to maintain an evaluation program 
for their own suppliers and identify any high-risk suppliers  
that operate as Tier 2 suppliers for Abbott. This helps to ensure 
that raw materials and services from our Tier 2 suppliers meet 
Abbott’s requirements.Monitoring and Evaluating Suppliers
Abbott has global policies and procedures for evaluating the 
potential sustainability risks of new and existing suppliers.  
Our Supplier Responsibility Program uses a risk-based 
approach to determine the level of monitoring, assessments  
and audits required for each supplier. This takes into account 
supplier industry taxonomy, the region of the world in which 
they operate and the amount that Abbott spends with them.
We use the DHL Resilience360© risk matrix tool to analyze 
about 10,000 sourcing locations for our critical suppliers and 
assess their level of risk. Resilience360© is a real-time risk— 
monitoring tool that issues alerts when risks emerge for a 
particular location. Resilience360© sustainability risk scores  
are calculated on the individual subscores for personal 
freedom, workers’ rights and child labor, in addition to  
an environmental score. 
Each year, we request our top 200 to 250 critical suppliers 
identified through the Resilience tool to participate in our 
Supplier Sustainability Survey. In addition, our Global 
Procurement team proactively identifies suppliers in high-risk 
industries, geographies and spend categories, and conducts 
intensive screening in emerging markets. Our category sourcing 
leads identify an additional 100 to 150 key suppliers each year 
to be included in our annual Supplier Sustainability Survey.Abbott’s Supplier Sustainability Survey is made up of about  
30 questions covering management systems, compliance and 
reporting, ethics, human rights and labor practices, health  
and safety, environmental performance, and supply chain 
management. Based on the survey responses, we select 
suppliers to participate in our annual audit program. The 
minimum time between audits for any given supplier is  
three years, with the frequency determined by the supplier’s 
sustainability survey score. See page 94 for more results  
of our 2020 survey.
Third-party auditors conduct Abbott’s supplier audits. An 
Abbott EHS leader and the supplier relationship owner within 
our Procurement team then interpret the results and identify 
any necessary actions. We define suppliers as “sustainability 
high risk” when our surveys, audits and screenings identify 
failure to comply with our Supplier Guidelines, or when there 
is risk of unintended environmental or social damage, business 
discontinuity or regulatory lapses. 
We work with suppliers to address any sustainability-related 
risks that our surveys and audits identify. In cases of major  
and zero-tolerance findings, we require the supplier to submit 
corrective and preventive action plans (CAPAs) as a document 
within 30 days of receiving the audit results. The owner of the 
supplier relationship at Abbott then follows up to ensure that 
the CAPAs are implemented.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      94
In addition to our supplier sustainability surveys and audits, we 
have programs to assess our chemical, API and waste suppliers 
to ensure that they are appropriately evaluating and mitigating 
environmental, health and safety risks associated with their 
industries. See page 95 for more details about these programs.2020 Supplier Sustainability Performance
In 2020, we evaluated 100 suppliers through Abbott’s Supplier 
Sustainability Survey. The suppliers surveyed represent all 
businesses and provide a variety of products and services to 
Abbott, including packaging, ingredients and clinical trials, 
manufacturing and product solutions, operational, technology 
and professional services, and commercial services. 
Key findings of the 2020 survey indicated the following:
•  100% have code-of-conduct and ethics policies in place or  
are developing them.
•  74% of suppliers have supplier diversity programs in place, 
and 15% are certified diverse or small businesses.
•  43% of suppliers have environment, health and safety,  
and sustainability programs, and an additional 57% are 
developing programs.
•  56% of suppliers are tracking carbon performance,  
11% are tracking waste, and 5% are tracking water and 
wastewater performance.
• 23% have business continuity plans. 
• 4% were subject to climate-related risk.
In the past three years, Abbott has also conducted site audits  
at 67 suppliers that we identified as being at high risk for 
sustainability issues. These audits used Workplace Conditions 
Assessment standards. We worked with the remaining 
suppliers to address the needs that the audits identified. In 
total, we have audited 3% of our Tier 1 suppliers, by spend,  
over the past three years.

In the face of an ever-more dynamic and fast-changing world, 
maintaining a resilient and adaptable supply chain is key to 
business success. Abbott works to ensure the resilience of our 
supply chain by collaborating across business functions to 
address complex supply chain challenges, leverage technology 
and improve transparency.
This approach delivers an increased understanding and, 
through this, we are able to adapt our supply chain to address 
external factors that may impact business continuity and 
improve our shared sustainability impacts across our value 
chain. These external factors include environment, social  
and economic risks, such as worker rights, climate change, 
natural disasters, resource scarcity, cybersecurity and  
disease outbreaks.
Abbott’s SCC and a Business Continuity group use the DHL 
Resilience360© risk matrix tool to: analyze sourcing locations 
for our critical suppliers2, assess their level of risk and track 
geopolitical, security, sustainability, environmental and 
infrastructure risks that could affect our supply chain. Through 
this system, we monitor supply-chain disruptions in real time  
to identify suppliers and locations at high risk of impacting 
business continuity owing to natural disasters and other issues. 
Abbott businesses have prepared contingency plans for such 
catastrophic events. 
We also use the World Resources Institute Aqueduct™ tool to 
determine which suppliers have the greatest risk of water supply 
interruptions. This mapping has identified that 23% of our 
critical suppliers currently operate in areas of high and extremely 
high baseline water stress. Mapping water stress in this way 
allows our businesses to engage with affected suppliers to ensure 
business continuity. For more information about our water risk 
management, see page 73 in the Environment section.The COVID-19 pandemic tested the resilience of Abbott’s 
supply chain to the extreme. We worked across our business 
functions to respond to the external challenges that the 
pandemic created, in the following ways: 
•  Building an inventory of raw materials and finished goods to 
ensure continuity of supply and, where possible, level loading 
within our supply chain
•  Monitoring supplier performance more tightly to identify 
distressed companies far enough in advance to enable 
contingency plans
•  Mapping supplier manufacturing sites in known COVID-19 
hot spots or in sites affected by government lockdowns
•  Offering COVID-19 testing for suppliers’ employees (for a 
very few strategic suppliers) to ensure continued operations 
and supply
Energy and Climate-Change Management
An organization’s average upstream emissions are around 
11.4 times greater than its direct operations. Because of this, 
organizations have much greater potential to reduce global 
emissions by influencing their supply chains. Abbott’s Scope 3 
emissions made up 93% of our carbon footprint. These 
emissions result from the sourcing, distribution, consumption 
and disposal of our products.We engage our suppliers to understand their climate-related 
activities, risks and opportunities through targeted initiatives 
across multiple Abbott functions. These functions include 
procurement, business continuity, risk management, environment, 
health and safety (EHS), and quality. Abbott’s SCC has 
expanded this engagement by developing strategic initiatives 
for several high-sustainability-risk sourcing categories: energy, 
transportation and distribution, agriculture, chemicals of 
environmental concern and API, packaging, dairy and waste 
management. These initiatives span our supply chain and the 
life cycle of our products.SAFEGUARDING BUSINESS

We engage our suppliers in order to do the following:
•  Identify and address climate-related risks that may impact 
business continuity 
•  Identify opportunities to design, produce and distribute  
our products with consideration for their impact on the 
environment and human health
•  Reduce suppliers’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions associated  
with the products and services that they supply to Abbott 
(our Scope 3 emissions) 
•  Implement solutions to reduce emissions affiliated with our 
business operations, such as business travel, meetings and  
the end-of-life treatment of products, and Abbott waste 
Details about each of these strategic initiatives are included in 
the Strategic Supply Chain Initiatives section on page 97 .
Through our Supplier Sustainability Survey, we annually assess 
critical and key suppliers to understand their carbon emission 
strategies and performance, as well as their climate-related 
risks and opportunities. For survey results, please see the 
Supplier Sustainability Performance information on page 94 .
The CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) provides a 
Supplier Engagement Rating (SER), which assesses how 
effectively companies are engaging their suppliers on climate 
change using their responses to questions on governance, 
targets, Scope 3 emissions and value-chain engagement. Abbott 
received an SER of A- in 2020, which places our business in  
the Leadership band. This is higher than the North America 
regional average of B-, and higher than the Medical Equipment 
and Supplies sector average of C. Abbott is among 21% of 
companies in our sector to be placed in the Leadership band.Product Traceability and Critical Materials Use
Abbott maintains traceability of our products within the 
manufacturing and distribution chain by leveraging product 
identification technologies and enterprise resource planning 
solutions. Through these systems, we ensure compliance  
with regulatory, quality and control requirements. 
Critical materials used in our products are managed through 
our product stewardship program. See page 82 for more 
information about our product stewardship program. One-on-One Strategic Supplier Engagements
Our Global Procurement and Global Environment, Health and 
Safety (GEHS) teams actively engage with strategic suppliers  
in one-to-one partnerships to identify and address sustainable 
supply-chain risks and opportunities. We work with these 
suppliers to share best practices on the management of 
sustainability issues, as well as to explore initiatives to improve 
the sustainability of Abbott products and the products and 
services our suppliers provide to us. In the past three years, 
Abbott has partnered with nine strategic suppliers to engage  
on sustainability issues, and in 2020 we partnered with three.  
Supply Chain Partnerships and Training
Abbott partners with various stakeholders across our value 
chain to identify and mitigate our shared sustainability impacts. 
We work with supply chain organizations, like the Manufacturers 
Alliance for Productivity and Innovation and the Institute for 
Supply Management, to ensure that our supply chain strategy 
aligns with leading standards and best practices.
Abbott is also a member of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain 
Initiative (PSCI) to establish and champion responsible supply 
chain management in order to continuously improve social, 
health, safety and environmentally sustainable outcomes for 
our supply chains. Through the PSCI, we collaborate with 
peers and suppliers to improve our supply-chain sustainability 
programming, as well as to offer our suppliers capability training 
through both online and in-person learning opportunities.

As part of our approach to managing environmental and social 
sustainability risks and opportunities in our supply chain,  
the SCC has developed strategic initiatives for several high-  
sustainability-risk sourcing categories. These aim to reduce 
shared impacts across our value chain.
In 2020, our strategic supply chain  
initiatives engaged with more than 9,000 
suppliers, influencing more than 40% of 
Abbott’s supply-chain spend. 
Supplier Diversity
Supplier diversity is an essential element of a sustainable 
supply chain. Building an inclusive supplier base enables 
Abbott to leverage a broader range of talent, insights and ideas 
while increasing supply-chain resilience and doing business  
the right way.
Abbott’s Supplier Diversity Program is designed to create 
competitive advantage for diverse and historically disadvantaged 
suppliers and provide them with opportunities. In 2020, we 
continued to prioritize our efforts to increase our spend with 
minority-, women- and LGBTQ-owned businesses. We also 
continued to strengthen our Supplier Diversity Tier 2 program, 
which focuses on growing the diversity of our extended  
supply chain.
Under our Tier 2 program, we work with key and strategic 
suppliers to encourage them to increase their own  
supplier diversity.Abbott’s efforts to support supply chain diversity include our 
partnerships with the Council for Supplier Diversity and 
Chicago United, through which we have developed the Abbott 
Supplier Diversity Connections and Five Forward program. 
This program connects diverse suppliers to business opportunities 
and helps develop business skills through mentoring. Abbott 
also continues to play an active role within the Diverse 
Manufacturing Supply Chain Alliance (DMSCA), which 
supports small and minority-owned manufacturing suppliers 
bringing innovative solutions to market. 
In 2020, we completed an economic impact analysis to 
understand how partnering with diverse and small businesses 
has a positive impact on business growth, employment and 
revenue. From this analysis, we found that our 2019 Supplier 
Diversity Program supported more than 9,400 jobs and had  
an estimated economic impact of $1.9 billion in the communities 
where our diverse suppliers operate in the United States and 
Puerto Rico. In addition, the communities we impact through 
our supplier diversity program saw significant growth in the 
female workforce employed, particularly for African American, 
Hispanic and Asian demographics.
In 2020, we surpassed $2 billion in spend with diverse and 
small businesses for the first time, increasing our economic 
impact beyond that of 2019. In 2020, we worked with 5,575 
diverse and small businesses, representing $2.3 billion in 
procurement spend, an increase of 23% from 2019 to 2020. 
During this same time frame, our spend with small businesses 
increased 19% and spend with minority-owned businesses 
increased 39%. STRATEGIC SUPPLY CHAIN

Diverse and small businesses also played key roles as Abbott 
developed and accelerated COVID-19 testing throughout 2020. 
In total, 11 small and diverse businesses were involved in 
bringing testing solutions to our customers in 2020. These 
suppliers provided construction services and manufacturing 
equipment as we built out additional manufacturing capacity  
to meet global demand for COVID-19 testing. These suppliers 
also supplied goods and services for the creation of the tests 
themselves, including all starting materials.
In total, these 11 suppliers represented $94.7 million in 
procurement spend in 2020, offsetting some of the impact of 
the pandemic on small businesses and their communities in  
the United States and Puerto Rico.
DiversityPlus magazine listed Abbott as a 2020 Top 10 Champion 
of Diversity in recognition of our Supplier Diversity Program. 
The journals Black EOE Journal, Hispanic Network, U .S. 
Veterans Magazine and Professional Women’s Magazine  
also awarded Abbott the title of Best of the Best Supplier 
Diversity Program.
ACCELERATED EFFORT IN OUR  
SUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROGRAMAgriculture
We have identified agriculture as a strategic sourcing category 
where opportunities exist to reduce our shared sustainability 
impacts across the supply chain. In recent years, we have 
engaged with strategic agriculture suppliers to ensure that they 
are appropriately managing potential social and environmental 
impacts associated with the products that they source  
for Abbott. 
Abbott is also a leader in food safety and sustainability, through 
an internal surveillance program that tests above-industry 
requirements. We put special emphasis on establishing strong 
global relationships with our supply base to control quality and 
sustainability. Abbott’s Food and Safety Council (including 
representatives from Supply Chain, Regulatory, and Research 
and Development) meets on a quarterly basis to address 
concerns related to our agriculture supply chain, including 
sustainability issues. 
We also implement sourcing strategies to mitigate sustainability 
issues and risks when they are identified. For example, Abbott 
does not use palm oil in our products and has a program to 
ensure that all palm-affiliated product suppliers (such as palm 
nuts) are certified to be responsibly and ethically sourcing 
these products. 
Abbott does not use palm oil in our products; 
100% of palm-affiliated ingredients used in 
our products are certified to be ethically and 
sustainably sourced. In our nutrition business, more than 95%  
of our milk supply (by spend) is certified  
to improve the health and welfare of the 
dairy animals that produce our ingredients.
Animal Welfare in Dairy
Abbott is committed to improving the health and welfare of the 
dairy animals that produce ingredients for our products around 
the world, and we fully support the Five Freedoms of animal 
welfare, as endorsed by the World Organization for Animal 
Health. We believe that animal welfare both enriches the  
lives of dairy cows and has social and economic benefits for 
dairy farmers. In 2020, 95% of the milk that we procured  
(by spend) was certified to animal welfare standards.
From 2018 to 2020, we worked in partnership with World 
Animal Protection and our local dairy suppliers to advance our 
animal welfare training program in India, which promotes 
better access to water, proper housing, animal nutrition and 
proper veterinary care.
World Animal Protection implemented a “train the trainer” 
strategy to educate more than 11,000 farmers and family 
members through the program, identifying the farmers with 
the greatest potential for implementing change, and then 
encouraging them to share their experiences and results  
with others.
An early-stage report in 2020 found that 44% of participating 
farmers reported higher milk production and/or a higher 
quality of milk.2020 2018–2020

CHEMICALS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN  
AND ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICALS SUPPLIER 
ASSESSMENT PROGRAM
Chemicals of Concern and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 
In 2017 , Abbott’s branded generic medicines business established 
an engagement program to identify suppliers operating in at-risk 
regions that handle chemicals of high environmental concern if 
released into the environment, including active pharmaceutical 
ingredients (APIs). These regions include China, Europe, India 
and Latin America. The program aims to minimize our  
environmental risk exposure and ensure business continuity. 
Through this engagement program, we assess and audit 
suppliers that we determine to be critical to business continuity, 
that have negative media exposure and/or notices of violation. 
Since this program launched in 2017 , we have completed  
160 EHS audits at supplier facilities (31 desktop audits were 
permitted in 2020 owing to COVID-19); 276 suppliers have 
completed self-assessments. In 2020, through this program, 57 self-assessments were 
completed by suppliers, and 14 on-site EHS audits and 32 
desktop audits were completed.
Energy Procurement
Our GEHS and Global Procurement teams work together to 
purchase electricity from utility providers that include above-  
average renewable generation in their energy mix. We estimate 
that 78,000 metric tons of CO2e were avoided through the 
purchase of renewable energy in 2020. For more details of our 
renewable energy supply initiatives, see the Environment section 
on page 69 .
Business Travel
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott significantly 
reduced nonessential business travel in favor of virtual meetings 
and events. As a result, we were able to reduce the carbon 
emissions affiliated with business travel by 59% compared  
to 2019.2020 2019 2018 2017

Transportation and Fuel Efficiency
Abbott’s transportation and distribution strategy prioritizes  
the need to provide patients with timely access to life-saving 
technologies. We have identified upstream and downstream 
transportation as one of the greatest opportunities to reduce  
our Scope 3 carbon emissions, and we strive to minimize the 
environmental impacts related to the transportation and 
distribution of our products whenever possible. However, we 
have to balance this with the need to expedite shipping and get 
our products to where they are needed, when they are needed.
This balance has been particularly important during 2020,  
owing to the impact of COVID-19. Disruption caused by the 
pandemic meant that we could rely less on many of our most 
fuel-efficient modes of transportation. In order to deliver 
COVID-19 tests and other Abbott products to those in need,  
we increased our use of air freight and paid premiums to 
maintain or improve delivery times for these essential products. We have implemented several global initiatives to improve  
the fuel efficiency of our transportation services:
•  Shifting to more sustainable transportation methods
•  Optimizing packaging and truckload efficiency
•  Implementing fuel efficiency requirements in contracts with 
our transportation suppliers
•  Maximizing efficiencies through fleets dedicated to  
each customer
For example, in 2020, Abbott transported freight more than  
42 million miles using multiple modes of transportation across 
North America. This included 2.7 million miles and 1,386 
shipments through intermodal transport and 39.4 million miles 
and 66,250 truckloads sent over the road. Through operational 
improvements, we eliminated more than 6,500 loads shipped 
(8.8%) during 2020, despite a 4.4% increase in sales, compared  
to 2019.Since 2018, Abbott’s U.S. businesses have also been part of the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SmartWay® 
program, which helps companies advance supply-chain 
sustainability by measuring, benchmarking and improving 
freight transportation efficiency. We will continue to encourage 
our transportation and distribution providers to adopt more 
fuel-efficient technologies as they become available.2020 2019 2018

Sustainable Packaging and Waste 
Our waste and materials management efforts extend beyond 
our own operations and require partnership with our material 
suppliers, as well as our waste-disposal vendors. Establishing 
partnerships with suppliers and other stakeholders is a key 
tenet of our strategy to reduce Abbott’s waste and material 
impacts across our value chain. 
Abbott partners with suppliers and other material management 
stakeholders to implement more sustainable packaging 
materials, designs and manufacturing processes for our product 
packaging and the packaging of inbound materials to Abbott 
operations.
Through these supplier partnerships, we have optimized the 
use of packaging materials, increased the sustainability of our 
fiber-based packaging, reduced the use of nonrecyclable plastic, 
implemented reusable packaging and takeback initiatives, and 
implemented recycling and reuse opportunities that divert  
our operational waste streams from landfill.
Our 2020 Targets
Supplier partnerships have played a key role in the achievement 
of our 2020 packaging and waste reduction goals. These 
partnerships helped Abbott eliminate more than 42.1 million 
pounds of packaging from 2010 to 2020, to achieve an 88.5% 
diversion rate of materials from landfill and incineration 
without energy recovery, and to certify 31 of our manufacturing 
sites and seven nonmanufacturing sites as Zero Waste to Landfill. 2030 Sustainability Targets
With the adoption of our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we will 
continue to partner with suppliers to adopt a circular waste  
and materials management approach through our goals to  
do the following:
•  Address 50 million pounds of packaging through high-impact 
sustainable design programs
•  Reduce waste impacts using a circular-economy approach  
to achieve and maintain at least a 90% waste-diversion rate
•  Engage with key suppliers to reduce the environmental 
impact of materials sent to Abbott that become waste in  
our operations, as well as develop and track supplier waste- 
diversion initiatives
Waste Supplier Evaluation
Abbott seeks to partner with waste vendors that have the  
expertise required for responsible and efficient waste management 
and processing. We evaluate all suppliers that manage Abbott 
waste through our Waste Vendor Assessment Program, which 
assesses suppliers that manage our waste every five years, or 
more frequently, depending on the type of waste and level of 
risk identified.100% of our waste and materials management 
suppliers are assessed at least once every five 
years—ensuring only qualified and responsible 
suppliers manage Abbott’s waste.
In 2020, as a result of COVID-19, we granted an exception  
for waste vendors required to participate in on-site audits  
to complete desktop audits instead. In 2020, we assessed  
56 waste suppliers, completed 24 on-site audits and 32 desktop 
audits under the 2020 COVID-19 protocol.
We will require on-site audits within one to three years, 
depending on risk, if the progress of the pandemic allows. In 
the meantime, we have adopted a policy of only authorizing 
new waste vendors to handle hazardous waste for Abbott if it is 
absolutely necessary, or until they have been able to complete 
on-site audits. 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016

1. Abbott considers a supplier to have high sustainability risk when a supplier is 
found by either screening, survey or on-site audit to have potential risk exposure  
to unintended environmental or social damage, business discontinuity, and 
regulatory lapses.
2. Critical suppliers are defined as suppliers whose goods, materials or services have 
a significant impact on business continuity; they include high-volume suppliers, 
suppliers of critical components and nonsubstitutable suppliers.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      102

Abbott’s 2030 Sustainability Plan focuses our strategy on 
bringing innovative healthcare solutions to the people who 
need them. It also sets clear objectives that support this 
priority in areas such as building a diverse, innovative 
workforce and protecting a healthy environment. 
We recognize that these objectives and priorities must rest on 
sustainable foundations. We cannot improve the lives of more 
people without the trust of patients, healthcare practitioners, 
regulators and other stakeholders. We earn this trust by  
always operating ethically and with integrity, and through  
our determination to protect the quality and authenticity of  
our products.

Focusing on Noncommunicable Diseases
Finding new solutions to treat chronic diseases has long been  
a part of our work to help people live fuller, healthier lives. 
With noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) currently the leading 
cause of mortality worldwide, turning the tide—whether 
through prevention, diagnosis or treatment—is more critical 
than ever.
In 2019, we launched our Future Well™ initiatives: a series of 
programs and collaborations with leading organizations and 
communities focused on outsmarting the drivers of NCDs,  
such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The school-based 
Future Well Kids program helps encourage the development  
of lifelong healthy habits at an early age.
We’ve reached almost 1,000 students in underserved communities 
of Ireland, Mexico and the United States in the program’s first 
year. In 2020, we successfully pivoted the program to respond 
to the changed circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
developing virtual lesson plans that our classroom volunteers 
could teach remotely and launching a new website, Future Well  
Kids—For Families, with resources to encourage exercise and 
healthy eating at home.
Similarly, our Future Well Communities program employs a 
holistic community-health approach to breaking down the 
social and economic barriers to good health. These factors, 
known as the social determinants of health (SDOH), include 
access to healthcare and education, the environment, economic 
opportunity, and social factors like social support  
and discrimination. We launched Future Well Communities in 2019 in Stockton, 
California, one of the most diverse communities in the United 
States, where nearly 60% of adults have diabetes or prediabetes 
and 33% are obese. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have 
provided grants to our partner organizations in Stockton to 
provide screening services, food and frontline support to more 
than 100,000 people. 
We have also continued to help residents address diabetes, 
focused on increasing access to health, education, transportation 
and healthy food.
For example, to address the need for healthcare workers trained 
to manage diabetes, we have partnered with the University of the 
Pacific to provide scholarships for students committed to 
working locally, as well as to create clinical and nonclinical 
diabetes certificate programs and a diabetes track for graduate- 
degree programs in nursing and social work.
To better meet the communities’ critical needs and address  
the racial inequities further exacerbated by COVID-19, we 
refined our strategy at the end of 2020 to prioritize the five 
most vulnerable neighborhoods in Stockton, linking patients  
to multiple services and driving consistent usage.
Managing NCDs in Emergency Situations
In 2019, we announced a three-year partnership with CARE 
and the Abbott Fund to screen, diagnose, prevent and manage 
NCDs for people who remain displaced two years after an 
armed conflict in Marawi City, Philippines. This partnership  
is among the first of its kind to address NCDs in areas affected 
by disasters, conflict and other humanitarian challenges, where 
managing NCDs is difficult, but critical. Launched in June 2019, this partnership aims to improve lives 
by creating a scalable and replicable new model for the effective 
prevention and care of chronic diseases in humanitarian 
settings around the world. Program work in Marawi City 
includes screening to identify people with NCDs and those  
at risk of developing NCDs. Nurses and other healthcare 
providers have been trained to lead “NCD clubs” to advance 
disease prevention and management through lifestyle changes 
and compliance with ongoing treatment.
The program also focuses on expanding access to needed 
clinical care and strengthening the ability of local healthcare 
systems to manage NCDs. In addition, campaigns have been 
raising awareness and educating on the prevention and control 
of NCDs from the community to the national government level.SUPPORTING COMMUNITY

To deliver this new model, the Abbott Fund is providing  
$1 million in funding, and Abbott is donating rapid-testing  
technology, diabetes monitors and test strips. 
Initial results from the program have been promising. More 
than half (51%) of diabetic and prediabetic patients saw a 
decrease in their fasting blood-glucose levels since baseline,  
and 46% saw a decrease in their average blood-glucose (HbA1c) 
levels, which is an indicator of better glucose control and lower 
risk of complications.
Strengthening Communities at Risk from Hurricanes
Since 2006, Abbott and our partners, Feeding America and 
Direct Relief, have been working to prepare communities for 
hurricane season, pre-positioning products in at-risk areas. 
These packs provide critically needed products to nearly 
20,000 people every year.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott volunteers did not 
participate in preparing disaster relief packs alongside Feeding 
America, as they have in recent years. However, with the help 
of our food banks, our donated nutritional products again filled 
4,000 packs—enough to assist 12,000 adults and children. The 
packs are stored at the food banks ready for deployment in the 
hours following a hurricane, targeting heavily impacted regions 
like Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico and Texas. Abbott products 
include Pedialyte® rehydration solutions, Ensure® and PediaSure®  
nutrition drinks, and ZonePerfect® bars. Abbott’s partnership with Direct Relief provides community 
health clinics with rehydration solutions and nutrition 
products that are distributed, along with first-aid supplies  
and medicines, following a disaster. First pioneered by Abbott, 
this initiative now includes contributions from many other 
healthcare companies, providing 75 clinics in the southern 
United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with the 
supplies required to treat 100 patients for three to five days.
Providing Relief in Natural Disasters 
Besides working to prepare communities, Abbott aims to 
respond rapidly when natural disasters or other emergencies 
strike. In 2020, Abbott and the Abbott Fund donated more  
than $1.8 million in funding and in healthcare and nutritional 
products to address both immediate needs and longer-term 
recovery efforts following devastating events. These included 
hurricanes throughout the United States and wildfires in 
Australia and on the West Coast of the United States. For more 
than a decade, our rapid response to earthquakes, typhoons  
and flooding worldwide has involved providing more than  
$50 million in funding and medical supplies.Abbott exists to enable people to live fuller, healthier lives 
through better health. We strive to make an impact on policies 
and priorities that have a positive effect on people’s health and 
well-being. This includes enabling broader access to healthcare 
and life-changing technology. 
We must demonstrate that our advocacy is always ethical and 
responsible and that we operate all aspects of our business 
fairly, honestly and with integrity. We are committed to 
adhering to all applicable laws and regulations in every aspect 
of our work as a global healthcare leader.
We have a clear strategy for building a culture of compliance  
at Abbott that engages all of our employees and that emphasizes  
the importance of ethical behavior. In this section, we describe 
the channels we use to promote ethics and integrity and the 
systems we have in place to embed ethical behavior and 
manage compliance risks.PROMOTING ETHICS  
AND INTEGRITY

Abbott’s Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) is the 
Vice President responsible for leading our ethics and compliance 
program and managing our Office of Ethics and Compliance 
(OEC). The CECO regularly reports on compliance matters to 
our President and CEO and senior-level leaders and our Board 
of Directors and its committees.
Abbott’s Business Conduct Committee (BCC), which is chaired 
by the CECO, assists in implementing the compliance program. This group meets regularly to discuss the changing legal and 
regulatory environment, monitor best practices and refine 
Abbott’s approach. The BCC consists of senior-level leadership 
and is directly accountable to our President and CEO.
Compliance committees monitor compliance at the global, 
business, regional and country levels, providing training, 
ensuring employee awareness and engagement, and meeting 
regularly to discuss emerging issues. Each Abbott business and function has dedicated OEC staff 
members who support the business in implementing our  
ethics and compliance program. Outside the United States,  
we have dedicated regional and country OEC personnel  
who support our global businesses with country-specific 
compliance requirements.GOVERNANCE
PROTECTING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN THROUGH  
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP
Every day, all around the world, people see the Abbott brand 
and know they can trust they’re getting only the highest-
quality products. We work to earn that trust every day, 
creating and manufacturing products as if they were for our 
own families.
So, it’s of vital importance to us that when people see the 
Abbott brand, they’re actually getting an Abbott product,  
one that has been handled properly and kept safe in our 
established supply chain. That’s why we have developed an 
ongoing and extensive program to prevent counterfeiting  
and diversion of Abbott goods around the world.
It’s a task that requires constant vigilance. Over the past 
several years, we’ve developed a successful partnership with 
law enforcement agencies in Guatemala, which provides an 
excellent example of the ways in which we work to keep our 
products—and the people who depend on them—safe.
In the past, when it was suspected that our products were 
being counterfeited or diverted, our Global Security Team would contract a third-party vendor to conduct an 
investigation. Over time, it became clear that this approach—
due to a diversity of professional backgrounds and skill 
sets—was inefficient.
In Guatemala, our team worked with both local law 
enforcement and INTERPOL to develop a comprehensive 
training program to help individual law enforcement  
officers identify the Abbott nutrition products that are 
authorized to be commercialized in Guatemala and to 
recognize the signs of illegal diversion of those products.  
The success of these efforts led the Guatemalan Attorney 
General to create a Fraudulent Crimes Against Diversion  
and Contraband Division.
Since the program’s inception in 2018, Guatemalan 
authorities have seized roughly 18,000 counterfeit or  
illegally diverted products. And, as an additional benefit, 
media coverage of these efforts has served to help educate 
the public on the risks associated with consuming 
contraband products.

We have designed our global ethics and compliance program  
to align with the elements of an effective program set out in the 
voluntary Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers, which the Office of Inspector General, U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-OIG), 
published in 2003, as well as other guidance documents 
published by government agencies in the United States and 
other countries. We arrange for our compliance program to  
be reviewed externally on a regular basis.  
The laws of several countries require additional transparency 
and restrict how businesses can interact with healthcare 
providers. Abbott complies with all such requirements, 
including providing additional certification and tracking and 
reporting payments and transfers of value. This includes 
complying with federal and state-level transparency laws  
in the United States.In most of the countries in which Abbott conducts business, 
there are laws and regulations to protect personal information, 
including protected health information. For many years, Abbott 
has dedicated resources, standards and training focused on data 
privacy and data-protection topics and, in 2018, we formally 
incorporated the Global Privacy Compliance Program into the 
Office of Ethics and Compliance.
Policies and Standards of Conduct
Our Code of Business Conduct is the foundation for ethical 
conduct at Abbott. We have made our code available in  
29 languages, both in print and online. Every year, we require 
every Abbott employee to read the code and certify that they 
adhere to it. We roll out our code to every business that Abbott 
acquires, along with administering our compliance policies  
and procedures.The code explains Abbott’s values and that it is every employee’s 
responsibility to live them every day. This includes employees 
holding themselves to the highest ethical standards, keeping a 
watchful eye on our activities, reporting concerns in good faith, 
and always operating with honesty, fairness and integrity. The 
code highlights key areas such as the importance of adhering  
to policies and procedures, treating confidential information 
appropriately, avoiding conflicts of interest, and maintaining 
accurate books and records.
The code clearly states that Abbott does not tolerate illegal  
or unethical behavior in any aspect of our business and that 
employees are required to ask questions and/or report any 
concerns. Our code and other policies are aligned with the  
code of conduct guidelines issued by medical technology trade 
associations such as AdvaMed, APACMed, MedTech Europe 
and Mecomed.
We have developed a decision-making AID (Assess Impact 
Decide) framework to help our employees apply the code’s 
principles. In addition to guiding their actions, this helps them 
monitor behavior, ask questions and report concerns.
We also have a written policy, called Employee Problem 
Solving, that provides a system for employees to report concerns 
and enables the open exchange of information. It applies to  
all Abbott employees worldwide, except where local laws or 
collective bargaining agreements dictate otherwise.
We have made ethical interactions with healthcare professionals 
a key focus of our ethics and compliance program, as well  
as a focus of our Code of Business Conduct. We monitor  
our interactions with healthcare professionals and carry  
out periodic audits to track compliance with our policies.  OUR COMPLIANCE PROGRAM

We assess compliance risks for different regions and business 
areas and use these assessments to determine the frequency of 
our audits. We have a system in place for tracking action items 
from audits to ensure that business processes are quickly 
updated when required.
We also offer specific training on interactions with healthcare 
professionals as part of our Legal and Ethics Resource Network 
(LERN) training program. See the section Training and 
Awareness on this page for more details. 
Our commitment to ethical interactions with healthcare 
professionals, patients and consumers includes the obligation 
to communicate responsibly about our products and services 
and the alternatives that exist.
Our policies and procedures align with the regulatory licenses 
and approvals that we obtain to promote, sell and import 
medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition products and medicines. 
The OEC reviews product and brand promotions as part of its 
internal monitoring, and this activity is also included in our 
internal and external audits.
We update our ethics and compliance policies regularly to 
reflect changes to the law or industry codes, including rules  
on interactions with healthcare professionals. 
Transparency on Nutrition
Our nutrition business is dedicated to developing science-based 
nutrition products for people of all ages. We are committed to 
marketing these products ethically and ensuring that our practices 
comply with all local laws and regulations. We have well-established 
systems for ensuring that conduct at every level of the business 
conforms to our Global Infant Formula Marketing Policy, as 
well as the laws of the countries in which we operate.Process for Reporting Concerns
Our Code of Business Conduct emphasizes our employees’ 
responsibility to report concerns. This requires us to create an 
environment where they can do so in good faith, without fear  
of retaliation. The code outlines Abbott’s responsibilities for 
handling employee grievances and complaints in an ethical  
way, and it strictly forbids any retaliation against any person 
who raises a complaint. 
We have clearly defined systems and processes for asking 
questions and reporting suspected or actual violations of our 
code, policies or procedures. These include our Speak Up tool, 
which allows employees and external parties to raise concerns 
of potential misconduct in a manner that is confidential and 
(where permitted) anonymous, either by email, by telephone  
or through a website.
The Ethics and Compliance Officer for Investigations enters 
every report that is received into the investigations database  
or delegates somebody else to do so. This person assigns an 
investigator from the appropriate function to gather evidence 
so that the OEC can determine if action is required. We aim  
to conduct investigations as quickly as possible without 
compromising thoroughness and integrity, and we carry out 
periodic audits of the investigations process.
We also have a web-based Ethics and Compliance helpline with 
live telephone support and translation services for non-English 
speakers. The helpline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week. Employees may also contact the OEC, Legal or the CECO 
directly. We have additional systems in place for reporting 
through social media channels, which include reporting 
concerns, responding to questions on ethics and handling 
reports of suspected or actual violations.We use a comprehensive reporting and investigations case- 
management database to process, track and resolve all concerns 
that are reported.  
Training and Awareness
Abbott’s employees participate in a global online Legal and 
Ethics Resource Network (LERN) training program, which is 
available in 95 countries and 27 languages. LERN educates our 
employees on all aspects of the code and provides practical 
guidance on how to recognize and respond to legal and ethical 
issues. LERN follows an annual curriculum, under which  
the OEC assigns courses to every full- and part-time Abbott 
employee, based on their role and responsibilities and  
the specific training that they require. In 2020, 100%  
of Abbott employees completed the LERN courses assigned  
to them.
The LERN curriculum includes certifications covering the 
Code of Business Conduct and Conflicts of Interest, with a key 
focus on interactions with healthcare professionals. All Abbott 
employees—full-time and part-time—review and sign these 
certifications every year. It also forms part of our ethics and 
compliance training for new employees.
We supplement training with communications designed to 
raise awareness of compliance issues and ensure engagement 
with our policies. These include emails, newsletters, videos and 
issue highlights on our OEC intranet site. Our OEC staff also 
participates in global, national and regional sales meetings, as 
well as local site meetings, creating the opportunity to discuss 
compliance issues face to face.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      109
Risk Assessments
The OEC regularly assesses compliance risks by reviewing  
the results of internal investigations, audits and monitoring 
programs, and pays close attention to the external risk  
environment. This includes changes to industry codes and  
best practices, guidance from governments, and enforcement 
actions taken against other companies. Our Anti-Corruption 
Compliance Enhancement (ACE) program evaluates the 
commercial practices of countries in depth in order to identify 
potential compliance risks.
The OEC develops improvement plans for our policies and 
procedures in response to any emerging compliance risk that  
it identifies. We then track progress toward implementing  
these plans.
Corruption risks are also included in the enterprise-wide risk 
assessments conducted by our corporate audit group, which  
are carried out at least once a year.
Monitoring and Accountability
We use our compliance risk assessments to guide our  
international program of audits and monitoring. This program 
assesses compliance with our code, as well as with our ethics 
and compliance policies and procedures. Our risk assessments 
determine the frequency and scope of audits for different 
businesses and countries, as well as for different types of 
interactions and activities. We track all action items resulting 
from our audits and hold business leaders accountable for 
making any improvements to our business processes in a  
timely manner.Managers and supervisors have a heightened responsibility  
for leading by example when it comes to compliance and 
making Abbott’s expectations clear. It is part of their role to 
ensure that employees understand, and are held accountable,  
to the code.
Investigations and Corrective Actions
Adhering to our Code of Business Conduct is a condition of 
continued employment at Abbott. We investigate all reports  
of potential violations of our code, policies or procedures and 
take appropriate corrective action.
Any Abbott employee who violates our code, policies or 
procedures is subject to appropriate disciplinary action, which 
may include termination. Corrective action may also include 
terminating third-party relationships. Any Abbott employee 
who refuses to cooperate in an investigation may also be 
subject to disciplinary action, as may any employee who reports 
a concern that is knowingly false or intended to threaten, 
intimidate or retaliate.
Abbott does not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports 
a violation in good faith. We publicize these guidelines widely 
and enforce them throughout the company.
We regularly report information about investigations to our 
Board of Directors and senior management and communicate 
the results of investigations, audits, assessments and monitoring 
to the appropriate OEC staff and business leaders. When an 
area for improvement is identified, the OEC collaborates with 
Abbott’s business leaders to take corrective action.LEGAL AND ETHICS RESOURCE NETWORK

COMBATING CORRUPTION  
AND BRIBERY
As a global healthcare company, we interact with thousands of 
people daily, from consumers and healthcare professionals to 
third-party distributors to government agents. It is, therefore, 
essential that we never provide or accept anything of value in 
order to gain an improper business advantage or inappropriately 
influence a business decision.  
Abbott’s Global Anti-Corruption Policy prohibits bribery and 
corruption in any form and is available in 29 languages. Each 
year, employees complete training on anti-corruption and  
other policies and procedures, and we have established internal 
controls to prevent bribery and corruption, including the following:
• Risk assessments
•  Policies and procedures that provide guidelines and approval 
requirements for various business interactions and activities
•  An independent internal audit team that reports directly  
to the audit committee of the Board of Directors, which 
conducts audits verifying compliance to our policies and 
procedures
•  A platform allowing employees and external parties to  
raise concerns of potential misconduct in a manner that is 
confidential and (where permitted) anonymous (see Process 
for Reporting Concerns on page 108)
•  OEC approval of all procedures regarding items that could  
be characterized as gifts, including brand reminders, cultural 
courtesies and items of medical utility
•  Investigations of all reports of potential violations (see 
Investigations and Corrective Actions on page 109 )As a publicly traded company, we are also subject to continuous 
audits by external auditors, the results of which are reported 
periodically to the audit committee of our Board of Directors.  
Abbott adheres to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and all other applicable  
anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. We also require that 
every third-party company with which we do business or  
that performs work on our behalf must act in accordance  
with these same laws. 
Third-Party Compliance
We expect third parties that work with Abbott to hold 
themselves to the same high standards of legal and ethical 
compliance to which we, as a company, hold ourselves. We  
have detailed these requirements in our Third-Party Guidelines , 
and any third party that has been or will be performing work  
on behalf of Abbott is expected to comply with them. These 
guidelines are available to third parties in 18 languages through 
our website.
The OEC has developed a Third-Party Compliance Process to 
identify and address corruption and bribery risks that occur 
when third parties interact with government officials or 
healthcare providers on Abbott’s behalf.The Third-Party Compliance Process requires Abbott businesses, 
subsidiaries and affiliates outside the United States to conduct 
due diligence before they engage third parties. It sets down 
centralized processes for screening third parties, identifying 
high-risk business partners, and monitoring and mitigating the 
risks involved. Each potential third-party partner is required to 
answer a detailed questionnaire, and Abbott engages an external 
vendor to issue a due-diligence/background check report 
covering risks, such as human rights and labor abuses, social 
accountability, corruption, arms trafficking and war crimes, fraud, 
violations of government-imposed sanctions, terrorism, money 
laundering, organized crime, anti-competitive behavior and 
regulatory breaches.
 
The process also requires that our businesses sign written contracts 
with all third parties that include compliance requirements. 
Additionally, the process provides guidelines for training, 
monitoring and auditing third parties. When risks are identified, 
the OEC and our Legal team implement appropriate remedial 
action. Remedial action can include additional contract terms, 
auditing, monitoring, training or termination/rejection of the 
third party.
 
We routinely update our Third-Party Compliance Process tools 
and resources to mitigate third-party risks and better equip our 
business to prevent bribery and corruption.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      111
Preventing Anti-Competitive Practices
Abbott is committed to complying with competition laws in 
every country where we do business. These laws prohibit 
agreements and practices that eliminate or discourage 
competition and apply to many aspects of our business, 
including relationships with competitors, prices and terms  
of sale to distributors and other customers, and marketing 
and trade practices. 
We have implemented a program to ensure that our operations 
comply with competition laws around the world. This 
compliance program includes policies and procedures for 
interacting with competitors, risk assessments, training  
and monitoring.
As part of the program, we have established an in-house 
Competition Law Practice Group, which is composed of 
members of our Legal team, including experienced competition 
lawyers, and members of the OEC. The group meets regularly 
to identify competition law risks and determine how best to 
address them. They also discuss competition law developments 
that impact the company’s global operations and assist in 
providing ongoing competition law training to employees. 
We encourage employees to contact our Legal team or the  
OEC directly for legal guidance regarding interactions with 
competitors and to report any inappropriate conversations. 
Reports can also be made through the company’s Ethics and 
Compliance helpline. See our Process for Reporting Concerns 
on page 108 for more details.Our purpose of enabling fuller lives through the power of 
health depends on trust, and trust in Abbott depends on our 
ability to consistently deliver safe, effective and high-quality 
products. That’s why we treat the people who depend on us as 
if they were our family. We are proud of the trust that our 
business has established over the past 130 years. We recognize 
that the process of earning that trust never ends, and it’s the 
responsibility of everyone at Abbott.
As Abbott evolves to meet emerging global healthcare needs 
and opportunities, we must ensure that our approach to quality 
and safety keeps pace with a constantly changing regulatory 
landscape. As a global healthcare company, we must monitor 
and adapt quickly to changing local regulations in the more 
than 160 countries where we operate. We have rigorous 
processes for embedding quality by design in all new products, 
and we closely monitor compliance on a global basis.DELIVERING QUALITY

Responsibility for global quality, engineering and regulatory 
matters across Abbott sits with our Senior Vice President, 
Quality Assurance, Regulatory and Engineering Services, a 
corporate officer who reports directly to our President and 
CEO. Dedicated quality and regulatory leaders within each 
Abbott business report to the presidents of the businesses they 
support and are accountable to the Senior Vice President, 
Quality Assurance, Regulatory and Engineering Services.We take a holistic view of quality across our organization and 
beyond, with systems and policies to drive consistency (as 
appropriate), compliance and continuous improvement. These 
include programs to embed quality, safety and sound product 
stewardship throughout our value chain.  
Our senior quality, regulatory and operations leaders meet at 
least quarterly to analyze trends, elevate concerns and review 
best practices for quality and compliance. Their input ensures 
that our quality-management systems align with global 
industry standards and the changing regulatory landscape  
in our key global markets.
Quality-Management Systems
We map our critical outputs to process and design inputs and 
monitor quality throughout the full product life cycle. When 
developing new products, we conduct rigorous product-safety 
tests that are tailored to the product requirements. 
Our systems focus on assessing two types of quality attributes: 
those related to the product design and those related to the 
manufacturing process. We use risk assessments and failure 
mode effects and analysis (FMEA) to ensure robust processes 
and embed quality by design. 
We have developed a multicomponent model and proprietary 
metrics to track the quality-system performance of our 
businesses and individual manufacturing sites. We review  
our model and metrics at least annually to ensure that they 
continue to assess relevant quality and compliance risks.  
We challenge ourselves with aggressive metric targets to 
continuously improve and identify early warning signals.When we identify a change in performance at a site or a 
business, we analyze the causes of the change, take action  
when required, and capture best practices and key learnings  
to apply elsewhere in our organization. 
We continue to introduce predictive analytics to our quality- 
performance tracking. This involves applying machine-learning 
models that identify and enhance our ability to predict 
potential performance, quality and compliance risks.
Our global internal audit programs assess compliance with 
both regulatory standards and our own internal standards and 
processes. Our audits assess internal processes, such as design, 
production processes, supply chain, data integrity, corrective 
and preventive actions (CAPA), and complaint handling. Each 
of our operating businesses also performs internal quality 
audits in line with local regulatory requirements and then 
highlights any findings in management reviews. We develop 
correction plans to address any compliance issues our  
audits identify.
Our Nutrition Business
Abbott’s nutrition business ensures food safety through a 
tightly controlled manufacturing process that encompasses all 
steps from accepting materials from suppliers through to final 
product distribution. We monitor and verify microbiology, 
packaging integrity, and nutrient and lot control. We complete 
extensive finished product testing before releasing it for 
commercial distribution.MANAGEMENT APPROACH GOVERNANCE

Our Devices and Diagnostics Businesses
Safety requirements are core design inputs in the development 
of new devices by Abbott’s devices and diagnostics businesses. 
We perform design verification and design validation studies  
to ensure that every device meets its defined design inputs. 
These include human factor assessments and risk assessments, 
such as safety factors for both patients and those working in 
clinical laboratories.
We focus on the safety and performance of a device throughout 
its lifetime and continue to confirm safety and performance 
once a product is released. We do so through batch-release 
testing, analyzing feedback from users, and reviewing scientific 
and performance data.
Pharmacovigilance
Abbott’s branded generic medicines business uses a single 
pharmacovigilance (PV) system for all of our marketed  
pharmaceutical products. The PV system monitors instances of 
safety reports worldwide, provides a framework for collection 
and ensures reporting to the relevant authorities. We provide 
PV system training for all employees in this division, and our 
division’s senior management regularly reviews the system to 
ensure our products are fully compliant.
We collate information on any suspected adverse reaction to 
our pharmaceutical products from a wide range of worldwide 
sources. These sources include business partners, health 
authorities and patients who can communicate with us via 
phone, website, mail and email.We process all cases of suspected adverse reactions through  
a single global database. Trained personnel investigate each 
case, and we use medical review and quality-control checks 
throughout this process to ensure accuracy. In each case,  
we assess whether further information is needed and request  it when required. Once each case is completed, we communicate 
any reportable suspected adverse reactions to the applicable 
health authorities, in line with local regulations.
We perform safety surveillance activities on a product-by- 
product basis. We follow predefined, risk-based criteria  
and applicable local legislation on which products require 
surveillance and the frequency of the surveillance. We 
document the results of all safety surveillance appropriately.
We adopt a range of additional approaches to pharmacovigilance, 
including the following: 
• Screening scientific literature and relevant social media
• Publishing periodic safety reports
•  Handling safety-related inquiries from healthcare professionals, 
consumers, health authorities and medical societies
•  Monitoring and analyzing clinical studies and other relevant 
external sources
•  Documenting appropriately the results of ongoing  
safety surveillance PHARMACOVIGILANCE SYSTEM

One Abbott Approach to Commercial Quality
Our commercial quality assurance (QA) focuses on ensuring 
that the processes we have in place across Abbott’s supply 
chain maintain the quality and compliance of our products.
The One Abbott global commercial QA initiative is an ongoing 
program that focuses on establishing common procedures  
and processes for quality management. It emphasizes four  
key areas:
• Organization and professional development
• Operational excellence
• Customer satisfaction
• Supply chain assurance
Since the launch of the One Abbott initiative in 2016, we  
have aligned our quality systems for managing suppliers, 
documentation, warehouse controls, nonconformance and 
CAPA. The One Abbott team has hosted global conferences that 
have brought together representatives from Abbott businesses 
and affiliates worldwide. These conferences are an opportunity  
to share best practices, challenge the status quo and move  
QA forward.
Quality Certifications
Abbott maintains certification to global industry standards,  
and we have achieved independent quality certifications across 
our Global Manufacturing, Research and Development (R&D), 
and Commercial Operations. Not all of our certifications are 
regulatory requirements. However, we embrace all of them  
as opportunities to drive continuous improvement and 
operational excellence.Our standards include:
• ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 17025, ISO 22000 and ISO 90013
•  ISO 13485 (Medical Devices – Quality Management Systems), 
with 100% of device facilities certified
• NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) International
• GFCO (Gluten-Free Certification Organization)
•  GMP+ FSA (Good Manufacturing Practices Plus and Food 
Safety Assurance)
• FSMA (Food Safety Modernization Act)
• FSSC 22000
• Safety Assurance Certification
• HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points)
• Halal
• QAI (Quality Assurance International)
• Organic Certification
• Kosher
• Class A Certification
• SQF (Safe Quality Food)
Every Abbott nutrition manufacturing operation is certified to 
local and globally recognized GMP and food safety standards 
(e.g., SQF, ISO 22000 and FSSC 22000).Training and Certification
In 2020, we launched new quality training courses on data 
analytics, clean-room qualification, risk management and 
documentation controls. All employees will receive this 
training every three years to augment our established quality 
training programs. Also in 2020, the American Society for 
Quality (ASQ) and the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society 
(RAPS) certified 25 of our quality and regulatory professionals 
as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) 
auditors, biomedical auditors, quality engineers and regulatory 
affairs auditors. 
Product Quality Training
We provide education and training, based on current regulatory 
requirements and industry standards for good manufacturing, 
laboratory, clinical and distribution practices, to all of our 
employees who have responsibility for product quality. We 
offer more than 350 quality courses in multiple languages on  
a broad array of regulatory and compliance topics, delivering 
training in both online and instructor-led formats.

We determine our key topics for training through a review of 
current course offerings, inspection outcomes, the training 
needs of our target audiences and emerging industry topics, 
such as cybersecurity. We engage subject-matter experts from 
across Abbott to ensure the training is relevant and includes  
an appropriate depth of learning for each audience. 
We hold a monthly global webcast to share key information 
that impacts our operations and to connect learning with 
knowledge and performance. The webcast acts as a forum for 
exchanging information and insights within key areas such as 
quality, compliance, operations, regulatory and medical affairs. 
Annually, a global leadership forum is held, providing the 
business leaders with an opportunity to learn, share, connect and collaborate. Presentations and workshops focus on key 
topics to promote benchmarking and sharing of challenges and 
innovation between business sectors. 
New Acquisitions
New acquisitions play an important role in expanding our 
product portfolio and supporting innovation, diversity and 
choice for our customers. We have a well-defined process for 
assessing risk when integrating new acquisitions into our 
business and aligning acquired products with Abbott’s quality 
requirements.Following acquisitions, a cross-functional team assesses, 
identifies and prioritizes risks to develop integration action 
plans. We focus on ensuring compliance with country  
requirements, with the Abbott quality system, and with the 
need to provide safe, quality products to our customers.  
We also identify opportunities to learn from best practices  
at the businesses we acquire and to integrate these into our 
global policies and procedures.
A critical part of our process is ensuring that new employees 
from the acquired company receive Abbott quality training, 
continue to expand their knowledge and benefit from development 
opportunities. This provides a foundation for good quality  
management throughout the transition.

Product Quality Indicators
Abbott manufactures products at 93 sites across North 
America, Latin America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region, 
crossing many different jurisdictions and involving oversight 
from a range of different regulatory agencies. Our understanding 
of global regulatory trends leads us to expect increased 
oversight from each of these different regulatory agencies.
One of our key product quality indicators is the percentage of 
site visits from our regulators that result in zero findings or 
observations. Our sites received almost 500 visits from global 
regulators and health authorities in 2020, 81% of which 
resulted in zero findings. Our objective is to continuously 
improve this number, year over year.
The effects of COVID-19 meant that 2020 was a unique year for 
on-site visits. The overall number of visits decreased by around 
25%, and a large proportion of the visits that did take place were 
conducted remotely. We maintained a high level of quality and 
compliance, while learning how to navigate new technologies 
that enable remote visits and new ways of fulfilling information 
requests. In addition, internal audit teams adapted to remote 
visits, with on-site visits as permitted per pandemic conditions.We also respond proactively to all FDA warning letters and 
product recalls that relate to Abbott products. In 2020, Abbott 
had zero new warning letters. We successfully closed an open 
cardiac rhythm management (CRM) warning letter from 
 2017 that related to a business acquired by Abbott. The FDA 
completed an evaluation of Abbott’s corrective actions in 
response to the warning letter and concluded that Abbott CRM 
had addressed the items listed. A close-out letter was issued  
on April 28, 2020.In 2020, there were one Class I and 23 Class II FDA recalls for 
our products. These recalls impacted different products across 
Abbott’s diverse businesses.
All Abbott contract manufacturing facilities are audited  
by external regulators. A majority of our direct suppliers’ 
facilities are ISO certified (ISO 9001 or ISO 13485), as 
applicable, and demonstrate compliance and quality  
through certification audits.PERFORMANCE UPDATES

Aligning with Global Standards
The world’s regulatory environment continually evolves, and 
ensuring compliance globally requires significant technical 
expertise and investment. One example of this evolution is the 
publication of the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and In 
Vitro Diagnostics Regulation (IVDR) by the European Union 
(EU) in 2017 . Both the MDR and IVDR include multiyear 
implementation periods, which take effect on May 26, 2021 
(MDR) and May 26, 2022 (IVDR). We are working to ensure 
that Abbott’s global quality-management system is fully aligned 
with the new regulations by the end of these implementation 
periods. The leaders of our affected businesses and functions 
are working on identifying and implementing necessary product 
and process changes to comply with these new requirements. 
In addition, our businesses took action in early 2019 to prepare 
for the United Kingdom’s (UK) withdrawal from the EU 
(Brexit) and ensure continuity of supply to both the EU and  
UK markets. With the Brexit transition period having come  
to a close at the end of 2020, our attention is now focused on 
meeting the regulatory requirements that are in the process  
of being established in the UK and that will become mandatory 
on July 1, 2023. 
Product Stewardship
We have developed a product stewardship program to 
minimize the impact of our products and their packaging 
throughout the product life cycle. The program tracks and 
addresses regulations regarding hazardous, restricted chemicals 
and ensures due diligence regarding conflict minerals. We 
carefully monitor and document regulatory changes, and we 
inform all the affected areas of our company about the potential 
business impacts of these changes through regular product 
stewardship business meetings. We collaborate with the appropriate stakeholders, such as R&D, 
Procurement, Operations, Environmental, Health and Safety, 
and Regulatory, to ensure compliance to these regulations.
Hazardous Chemicals
Responding to regulations on hazardous chemicals is a key 
element of our product stewardship program, with significant 
implications for how our products can be used, recycled and 
disposed of. We continually monitor global hazardous chemical 
regulations to ensure that Abbott products are complying with 
current regulations when placed on the market.
Conflict Minerals
We have defined a due-diligence process for understanding the 
use and sourcing of conflict minerals in our products and our 
supply chain. This includes the 3TG minerals: tantalum, tin, 
tungsten and gold.
We file a Form SD1 and Conflict Minerals Report each year with 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in compliance 
with the Dodd-Frank Act. The form, the report and our 
position statement on conflict minerals can be found on  
our website . We are a member of the Responsible Minerals 
Initiative, which provides companies with tools and resources 
to support compliant, responsible sourcing from conflict-affected 
and high-risk areas.
We use the Responsible Minerals Initiative’s standardized 
Conflict Minerals Reporting Template to survey our suppliers 
on conflict minerals. We also use an automated conflict 
minerals analysis tool to help assess risk in our supply chain.Clinical Trials
Clinical trials in humans (also referred to as clinical studies)  
are essential in developing and evaluating the safety and 
effectiveness of medical products for the diagnosis, treatment 
and prevention of disease, and for drugs of abuse screening.  
We are committed to conducting clinical studies ethically, 
protecting the safety and privacy of the enrollees and ensuring 
data integrity. Where feasible, we conduct studies involving 
patients in regions of the world where the product is intended 
to be marketed. Where allowable and appropriate, we provide 
continued access to our investigational products.  
Abbott follows all applicable regulations in the countries where 
we conduct clinical studies or register products. We also follow 
nationally and internationally accepted standards for the rights, 
safety and welfare of enrollees, such as the International 
Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practices (ICH 
GCP), the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO 14155, 
ISO 20916 and other standards. We train employees and clinical 
sites on the proper conduct of clinical studies and employ both 
external and internal oversight of studies.
When planning our clinical studies, Abbott identifies and 
reduces controllable risks to patients. Either our Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
reviews any proposed research prior to commencement to 
assure patient protections. The informed consent procedures 
and consent form documents for any clinical study must 
conform to all relevant legal statutes and governmental 
regulations. During the course of a study, patients can report 
any concerns to the IRB. We monitor our studies on an ongoing 
basis to ensure compliance with Abbott standards and identify 
any unforeseen risks to patient safety. OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      118
This includes audits of contract research organizations (CROs) 
that conduct or manage studies on behalf of Abbott. If Abbott 
becomes aware of study misconduct, we report it to the 
appropriate authorities. No Good Clinical Practice inspections by 
regulatory agencies of the company or clinical trial investigators 
led to fines, penalties, warning letters or product seizures  
in 2020.
Clinical Trial Registrations
Abbott registers all applicable and/or covered clinical trials, 
regardless of outcome, in a publicly accessible clinical trials 
registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. For branded generic 
pharmaceuticals, this means that we register interventional 
clinical studies in patients as designated by national laws and 
regulations. For medical devices and diagnostics, this means we 
register interventional clinical studies of health outcomes and 
pediatric post-marketing surveillance studies, as designated by 
national laws and regulations.
Clinical Trial Results Disclosures
Abbott is committed to transparency and sharing important 
information about the clinical trials we sponsor. We recognize 
that there are important public health benefits to making 
clinical trial information available to healthcare providers, 
patients and the public. Our registrations and results disclosures 
adhere to all applicable national laws and regulations in 
countries where we operate.
Abbott discloses the results of all applicable or covered  
clinical trials as described above, regardless of outcome, in  
a publicly accessible clinical trials results database, such as 
ClinicalTrials.gov. We also report the results of any exploratory 
pharmaceutical clinical studies if the findings have significant 
medical importance, such as with important safety findings.Clinical Trial Data Sharing
The regulatory environment around sharing clinical trial data 
for research purposes is evolving. We continuously engage with 
stakeholders’ different approaches for sharing clinical trial data 
with scientific and medical researchers to advance medical 
science, while protecting confidential information.
Animals in Research
Abbott is committed to minimizing the role of animals in 
research and maintaining the highest standards of humane 
care and treatment while meeting requirements enforced by 
regulatory agencies. The FDA and other regulatory agencies 
still require animal safety and efficacy data for many of the 
innovative products we bring to patients today. We also have an 
ethical obligation to fully explore the potential health benefits 
and risks of our products before they are used by patients.
Abbott consistently works to develop new testing methods and 
programs to eliminate or reduce the need for animal models 
where feasible. Additionally, when animal tests are required, 
we strive to minimize the number and frequency of tests.
We employ the 3Rs approach by looking for ways to replace, 
reduce and refine the use of animals. Whenever possible, we 
adopt alternatives to animal research in the following ways:
•  Replacing the need for animal testing through non-animal 
research methods
•  Reducing the number of animals used in any conducted tests 
to the minimum necessary for valid results
•  Refining experimental procedures to avoid or minimize pain 
or distressOur laboratory-animal research programs and facilities meet  
or exceed U.S. and EU regulations, as well as those in other 
countries. For more than 35 years, we have also maintained 
accreditation from AAALAC International, the organization 
that helps ensure optimal practices, as set forth in the Guide for 
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and other international 
standards and regulations for animal welfare. AAALAC 
accreditation is entirely voluntary and is widely considered to 
be the preferred method to meet and maintain high standards 
of animal care and use.

Protecting Product Authenticity 
Ensuring the authenticity of our products is critical for 
maintaining trust in our brand. We take action to identify and 
eliminate counterfeit products in the marketplace through a 
strategy focused on four key areas: 
•  Securing our global supply chain through continual analysis 
to find weak points and advanced investigative tools to 
identify and prevent suspicious activities 
•  Overt and covert security features to identify authentic 
Abbott products, which include customized security labels, 
tamper-resistant seals and security features for cartons 
•  Collaborating with local law enforcement and regulatory 
organizations to identify and disrupt the criminal organizations 
involved in counterfeiting, illegal diversion and theft
•  Working closely with industry, governments and other 
organizations to share insights and strategies and formulate 
joint-action plans
Since 2018, our Global Security team has been using state-of-
the-art analytical techniques to identify and eliminate illicit 
internet sales. Over the course of 2020, this technology helped 
us remove more than 6,650 marketplaces, apps, websites  
and social media sites selling counterfeit, diverted, outdated 
and stolen products and more than 9,500 individual  
product listings.
In 2020, we continued to expand our partnerships with local 
and federal law-enforcement organizations in Latin America 
and Asia. Through these partnerships, we are educating officers 
about the risks of illicit goods entering the marketplace, and we 
are working together to identify, seize and destroy unauthorized 
and illegal products. These proactive measures have enabled 
Abbott businesses to maintain and grow brand trust and 
presence in these markets and improve overall sales.We innovate constantly to deter, detect and mitigate the risk  
of counterfeit and illegally diverted products while maintaining 
a competitive advantage across our global supply chain. 
Abbott’s Global Security, Legal, Trademark, Regulatory, Public 
Affairs and Business Unit (BU) teams drive this innovation, 
along with other internal and external entities. 
Our innovative supply-chain security efforts ensure Abbott 
exceeds the United States Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) enhanced Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism 
(CTPAT) Minimum Security Criteria (MSC). These measures 
include the following:
•  Partnering with CBP and an external vendor to implement a 
low-cost, highly effective surveillance system to assess and 
mitigate the risk from theft, counterfeiting and/or illegal 
diversion of Abbott’s products
•  Ensuring that Abbott remains a Tier 3 partner of the CTPAT 
(the highest level), which enables our products to move  
in and out of the United States with expedited processing  
and 80% fewer customs exams, saving millions of  
dollars annuallyAbbott’s BUs and Business Support Teams (BSTs) have 
developed playbooks for our key products that document 
product-identifying data through pictures of authorized 
packaging, authorized manufacturing locations and typical 
shipping lanes. This program coordinates, integrates and aligns 
Abbott’s anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion efforts with 
external agencies, and fosters awareness among government 
entities involved in import and export, enables us to detect 
counterfeit and illegally diverted products earlier, and amplifies 
investigative opportunities.
Our BSTs and BUs also work with ministries of health and law 
enforcement entities worldwide to identify counterfeit and 
illegally diverted products and also detect non-Abbott products 
that falsely claim they contain key active pharmaceutical 
ingredients (APIs) contained in genuine Abbott products. 
These efforts remove products that harm consumers, negatively 
impact the Abbott brand and reduce revenue.
Abbott’s Legal and Trademark teams, BSTs and BUs have 
partnered with an external vendor to implement a wide-ranging, 
highly effective online enforcement program. This program 
removes hundreds of fraudulent listings for counterfeit and 
diverted products from online marketplaces every month, 
creating value by protecting consumers and the Abbott brand 
from counterfeit products.SECURITY AND

Safeguarding Intellectual Property 
We are intent on developing a culture that protects our 
intellectual property and trade secrets from growing international 
threats. We focus our efforts on three fronts: 
•  We educate key employees to raise awareness of the importance 
of trade secret protection and train them in risk-reduction 
strategies.
•  We conduct Security Quality Reviews (SQRs) that take a 
holistic approach to identifying risks to Abbott’s critical assets 
and developing mitigation strategies. These SQRs include  
the assessment and mitigation of risk from trade secret 
misappropriation, as well as from illicit electronic monitoring 
and infiltration from malevolent insiders.
•  We work with key BUs to develop insider risk-mitigation 
programs that are comprehensive, implementable and fully 
compliant with external and internal governance. These 
efforts greatly reduce the risk to Abbott’s people, processes 
and assets (including our trade secrets).
In 2020, our Global Security Team continued to expand our 
trade-secret protection efforts by developing a virtual Security 
Quality Review (vSQR) process. The vSQR process has enabled 
us to assess risk across multiple Abbott business segments, 
despite the severe restrictions on travel imposed by the pandemic.
We also carried out multiple on-site, enhanced SQRs for the 
facilities and processes that are essential to development, 
production and transportation of our COVID-19 testing 
products. These enhanced SQRs ensured that the risk to 
Abbott’s competitive advantage and revenue was mitigated, 
without impacting production goals that were essential for 
Abbott and the U.S. economy.Protecting the Working Environment 
Safety in the workplace is a critical aspect of Abbott’s  
responsibility to our employees and is essential for our people 
to perform at their best. Our Global Security Team has 
responsibility for minimizing the personal risk to our employees 
as a result of external threats. This takes place on several levels:
•  Situational Awareness For Everyone Everywhere (SAFEE) 
training is designed to strengthen our employees’ vigilance 
and security awareness.
•  Abbott’s Global Communications Center (GCC) is a state-of-
the-art command center where our analysts monitor world 
events 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The GCC provides 
advance warnings of emerging and immediate threats, 
ensuring employees are safe and accounted for.
•  Our extensive network of regional security experts, who are 
located strategically around the world, offers assistance to 
regional businesses and to employees when traveling. 
•  Abbott’s Travel Safety program offers comprehensive support 
to our employees, from booking travel to their safe return home.
In 2020, our Global Security team provided training, including 
SAFEE training, to more than 16,850 employees worldwide. 
Our Travel Safety program supported more than 15,000 
international trips by more than 9,950 of our employees.Securing Our Supply Chain
We are committed to eliminating criminal activities, such as 
drug trafficking, terrorism, human trafficking, forced child 
labor, cyber threats and illegal contraband from our supply 
chain. We comply with all international customs laws, and  
we carefully screen our business partners to guard against 
unethical practices and security threats.
Since 2003, Abbott has participated actively in the CTPAT 
program run by CBP , which applies security standards to the 
global supply chain. This participation has included providing 
feedback on the new MSC for CTPAT that took effect in 2020. 
A revalidation audit of our CTPAT program under these 
criteria resulted in Abbott maintaining our highest status level. 
Many Abbott businesses also participate in the Authorized 
Economic Operator program, which is modeled after the World 
Customs Organization’s SAFE Framework of Standards. 
In 2020, our Global Security Team developed and implemented 
a framework to secure delivery of Abbott’s COVID-19 tests. 
This included monitoring 1,274 shipments with GPS and 
temperature sensors, reporting on 837 risk events and reducing 
the risk-events-to-shipments ratio from 84% to 65%. The team 
developed a Driver Departure Interview form in multiple 
languages and completed more than 400 background checks  
on carriers. To date, we have experienced zero losses among 
these high-value shipments.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      121
PUBLIC POLICY ENGAGEMENT
Public policy impacts our ability to develop the next generation 
of medical advances and make those advances accessible to the 
people they can help. Abbott’s role in these discussions is to 
work to ensure that policy positively impacts the people who 
rely on our work, our employees and our ability to continue to 
develop new products.
At the federal and state levels, we engage with governments, 
think tanks, trade associations, patient groups and other 
organizations to find policy solutions to the complex issues  
that challenge our healthcare system. We see this as part of  
our responsibility to ensure that legislators and regulators 
understand Abbott’s views on major healthcare issues and  
the repercussions of public policy.
It is vital that our engagement in this area always meets  
our ethical standards and complies with all relevant laws.
Abbott’s public policy engagement is guided by the  
following principles:
• We are committed to transparency and guided by our  
Code of Business Conduct in all public policy engagement.
• We pursue activities that shape policies to benefit the people 
who need our products, with a focus on improving access  
to new medical advances.
•  We are committed to participating in public policy discussions 
that have the potential to impact patients, consumers and  
our employees or Abbott’s ability to continue to produce  
new medical and nutritional advances.
Abbott is a member of U.S. trade organizations that engage in 
lobbying and other political activity. This activity is designed  
to advocate for our interests, those of our industry and, most 
importantly, those of the people who rely on our products. We participate in the political process by contributing to U.S. 
state and local candidates and political organizations through 
our Abbott Employee Political Action Committee (AEPAC).  
We choose to support candidates and organizations that we 
believe understand how government actions can affect access 
to medical advances, in addition to candidates and organizations 
that will work to promote an environment that fosters 
continued medical progress.
We do not make direct independent expenditures on behalf of 
candidates running for public office. If such expenditures are 
made in the future, they would be included in our semiannual 
report. Our political contributions are bipartisan, made without 
regard for the private political preferences of our officers and 
executives, and are based on the following criteria:
• Policy positions of candidates that reflect Abbott’s interests
•  Representation of geographic areas where Abbott employees 
and facilities are located
• Relevant legislative committee assignments of office holders
• A candidate’s ability to be elected
• The need for financial assistance
Abbott’s U.S. Government Affairs function, under the direction 
of the Vice President of U.S. Government Affairs, reviews and 
approves all political contributions. This includes ensuring that 
all contributions are consistent with the company’s guidelines 
and in accordance with applicable laws. The Public Policy 
Committee of Abbott’s Board of Directors reviews the 
company’s U.S. political contributions policy annually.In the United States, in compliance with the Lobbying 
Disclosure Act, Abbott files a quarterly report that includes  
the following:
1. Total federal lobbying expenditures
2.  The name of the specific piece of legislation or subject that 
was the topic of communication
3.  Disclosure of Abbott individuals who lobbied on behalf  
of Abbott 
4.  Identification of the legislative body or executive branch  
that was contacted
This report incorporates expenses associated with lobbying the 
federal government, including our federal Government Affairs 
office and the portion of trade association dues associated with 
federal lobbying.
In 2020, Abbott reported $3,960,000 in U.S. federal lobbying. 
Abbott’s latest federal lobbying disclosure filings can be found 
on the U.S. Senate Office of Public Records website or the  
U.S. House of Representatives Office of the Clerk website.  
The Public Policy Committee of the Abbott Board of Directors 
reviews an annual report of our advocacy priorities.

FOCUSING ON SUSTAINABILITY
Abbott’s sustainability reporting seeks to address the interests  
of a range of stakeholders. These include investors, customers, 
suppliers, employees and government and regulatory bodies, as 
well as communities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) 
and opinion leaders. We align our approach with the 
requirements of leading environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) ratings and sustainability indices and then seek feedback 
from our stakeholders in order to drive continuous improvement.
Evolving Our Approach
We have been reporting on aspects of our sustainability 
activities since the early 1970s, when our first reports focused 
on community engagement and environmental impacts. Our 
approach to reporting has continually evolved along with our 
business and the environment in which we operate. This year, 
our Sustainability Overview section outlines how we integrate 
sustainability into Abbott’s business, as well as provides an 
update on our 2030 Sustainability Plan. Throughout our 2020 
report, we analyze our performance against sustainability key 
performance indicators (KPIs) while providing important 
context on our governance and management approach to  
key sustainability issues. Each year, we align our reporting  
to the requirements of leading ESG ratings, as well as  
sustainability indices. We also refer to external standards on reporting and emissions 
calculations, such as the GRI standards (Global Reporting 
Initiative), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
standards and the World Resources Institute/World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP), and have aligned the 
content of this report with many of the requirements of  
those standards. 
Additional sustainability reports and performance updates, 
including country reports for key markets, can be found on the 
Sustainability Reporting page on our website.

METRICS ENDNOTES
All environmental data has been adjusted to account for acquisitions and divestitures, in accordance with the 
methodology prescribed in the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). We report data from acquisitions as soon as is practical. To that 
end, this data includes the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical, Glomed and Alere, Inc. Furthermore, this data reflects the 
divestiture of Abbott Medical Optics.
(a) This includes Alere employees.
(b) These percentages are as of December 31, 2020. Percentages represent a count of U.S. employees, excluding the 
rapid diagnostics business.
(c) Legacy Alere is included in Health and Safety and Scope 3 metrics beginning in 2019. Metrics 2010–2018 do not 
include Legacy Alere. 
(d) Annual incident rates are calculated per 100 employees, assuming the average employee works 40 hours per 
week and 50 weeks per year. This is equivalent to 200,000 hours worked.
(e) This is the percent change from 2019 to 2020.
(f ) This is the baseline year.
(g) This is the percent change from 2010 (goal).
(h) Progress toward 2020 carbon goal is reported using the GHGP Scope 2 market-based methodology. 
(i) Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the GHGP market-based methodology. Per the GHGP , where  
market-based information is not available, location-based results have been used as proxy. 
( j) Reported Purchased Fuel Scope 1 sources consist of fuel consumed by manufacturing facilities, sales fleet and 
Abbott-owned aviation. 
(k) Per WRI GHGP , Scope 1 refrigerant CO2e emissions include only those covered in the Kyoto Protocol.
(l) Reported Scope 2 sources consist of energy directly purchased by Abbott, such as electricity, steam and chilled 
water, as well as emissions from leased locations. Unless specified otherwise, emissions are calculated according  
to the WRI/WBCSD GHGP Scope 2 location-based method. (m) Abbott’s nonenergy-consumption greenhouse gas emissions, such as refrigerant releases and process air 
emissions, are omitted. The total CO2 equivalents from nonenergy sources are noted in the Total Emissions  
(Scope 1 and 2) Table.
(n) All Scope 3 calculations are adjusted to account for updated spend metrics. Sourcing category spend allocations 
are subject to change year over year in alignment with business strategy.
(o) This reflects emissions from fuel combusted at manufacturing facilities only.
(p) Water-stressed locations have been determined using the WRI Aqueduct™ global water risk mapping tool.
(q) Water withdrawal is equivalent to water intake. 
(r) Waste-generation data does not include materials that are reused beneficially.
(s) Abbott defines beneficial-use activities as sending material that otherwise would have been a waste, off site to  
be used as an effective substitute for a commercial product or commodity. Beneficial-use material is used as is or in 
substantially the same form as it was generated.
(t) Abbott began calculating beneficial-use commercial activities beginning in 2019.
(u) Abbott’s manufacturing diversion rate is calculated as follows: (beneficial use + recycling + incineration with 
energy recovery + other nonlandfill activities)/(total waste + beneficial use). Commercial and other building 
activities are included in this rate starting in 2019.
(v) The years 2010, 2017 and 2018 data represent manufacturing data only. Nonmanufacturing data was not broken 
down by fate prior to 2019.
(w) The definition for “government agency inspection” was updated in 2017 by Abbott to include routine visits and 
sample collection from regulatory agencies or designated representatives. This change is not reflected in our metrics 
for 2010–2016, only 2017 forward.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      153

Abbott’s purpose is helping people live fully through our 
life-changing products and technologies—and our philosophy  
is that the best healthcare solution is the one that can reach the 
most people who need it. That’s why we’re focused on creating 
products that are not just innovative, safe and effective, but also 
affordable and accessible to more people. See page 22 in the 
Access and Affordability section of this report.
 
As part of our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we have an intentional 
focus on designing sustainable access and affordability into the 
creation of our new life-changing technologies so that we can 
make them widely available at affordable prices to people who 
need them. Pricing, however, is only one of the factors that 
determine affordability. Abbott also is advocating for systems 
and approaches that broaden access while minimizing 
additional costs for consumers and payers.In 2020, Abbott’s product pricing reflected the company’s 
approach, with an annual global net sales price change of -0.4%, 
which compares to a Global Consumer Price Index (CPI) of 
1.7% for 2020.
 
This metric is modified from the metric provided by SASB, by 
substituting a global CPI for the U.S. CPI. Abbott believes that 
disclosing product pricing as a ratio tied to the Global CPI is an 
appropriate way for investors and other stakeholders to best 
understand pricing for products across our diversified, global 
businesses. Sales outside of the United States in 2020 comprised 
more than 60% of Abbott’s revenue. The global CPI is the total 
headline CPI for each country weighted by Abbott’s geographic 
revenue exposure. For more on Abbott pricing, see Abbott’s 
10-K filing for 2020 .OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      155

more details, see page 22 in our Access and Affordability section 
in this report.) Given the breadth of our product offerings, each 
Abbott division sells products using a variety of contracting 
methodologies. Divisions use a variety of price concessions in 
their sales contracting, including point-of-sale discounts, rebates 
and wholesaler chargebacks. These price concessions can be  
for single or multiproduct sales and may include products from 
multiple business units or divisions (such as all medical device 
business units or rapid and molecular diagnostics). Price 
concessions may be based upon factors such as volume, market share, purchase commitments or result from competitive 
bidding processes and are generally documented in executed 
contracts, purchase orders and term sheets. Point-of-sale 
discounts are reflected in invoices that show the discounted 
prices, and rebates are documented in written agreements with 
rebate calculations provided at the time rebate payments are 
made. Our customers span the globe and include federal, state 
and local governments, hospitals, group purchasing organizations, 
wholesalers, individual healthcare providers and consumers. 
We maintain pricing flexibility to meet the needs of our diverse 
customers, large and small, and to ensure that our essential 
healthcare products are available and affordable across the globe.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      156

2.2In assessing what sustainability means to Abbott, we monitor how our priorities and material issues align with the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) published by the United Nations (UN). The following examples represent some of the many ways  
in which our work to help people live better and healthier lives intersects with the SDGs.
India Dairy Program 
For Abbott, local sourcing is an important part of building a 
more inclusive business that reaches more people in more 
places than ever before. Through our partnership with 1,500 
dairy farmers in India, we have provided training and key 
resources required to produce greater quantities of higher- 
quality milk. As a result, the farmers’ income is more than 
double that of nonparticipants, while their costs have 
remained the same.Disaster Relief 
Since 2006, Abbott and our partners, Feeding America and 
Direct Relief, have been working to prepare communities  
for hurricane season, positioning crucial supply packages  
in at-risk areas. Over the last 14 years, these packages have 
supplied desperately needed nutrition and healthcare to more 
than 640,000 people.
Backpack Program
During the 2019–2020 school year, through support of Feeding 
America, the Global FoodBanking Network and the Northern 
Illinois Food Bank, we helped disburse more than 82,000 
backpacks and containers of food, the equivalent of more than 
1,000,000 meals, to food-insecure kids and their families so that 
they had nutritious food when school meals were not available.Vietnam Pediatric Program
In Vietnam, Abbott and the Abbott Fund have provided  
2,275 school children with nutrient-dense snacks, nutrition 
supplements, including Abbott’s PediaSure®, and have helped 
their families with hygiene supplies and health education. 
Despite COVID-19, the program achieved a reduction in 
malnutrition of 32% among participating children.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      161

3.8Our 2030 Goal
Our goal by decade’s end is to improve the lives of more than  
3 billion people each year—reaching 1 billion more per year 
than we do today.
Make access and affordability core to new product innovation:
We’ll design our technologies and products for broader access 
and affordability at every step–from every phase of our R&D 
process, to the materials we use, to manufacturing, to the ways 
we reach the people who need them.
Transform care for chronic disease, malnutrition and 
infectious diseases: 
Across our business and through collaboration, we’ll create 
new technologies and find new answers for chronic health 
conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease, malnutrition 
and infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, HIV , malaria, 
hepatitis and emergent pandemic threats.
•  Support global efforts to address noncommunicable diseases, 
including diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
•  Deliver scalable, integrated solutions to help reduce preventable 
deaths and infectious diseases (malaria, hepatitis, HIV , 
COVID-19 and others) with diagnostics, treatment and 
education programs, especially in high-prevalence areas.Advance health equity through partnership: 
•  We will work side by side with people and communities we 
serve, partners, governments and other stakeholders to 
address health disparities, expand access and remove 
barriers that prevent people from living healthy lives.
•  In 2019, we launched our Future Well™ initiatives: a series  
of programs and collaborations with leading organizations 
and communities focused on outsmarting the drivers of 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). In its first year, the 
school-based Future Well Kids program, which helps 
encourage young people to develop lifelong healthy habits  
at an early age, reached 33 classrooms in underserved 
communities of Ireland, Mexico and the United States. 
•  In 2020, we successfully pivoted the program to respond  
to the changed circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
developing virtual lessons that our classroom volunteers can

COVID-19 in the United States. We collaborated with the 
Partners In Health and their partner organization Community 
Outreach & Patient Empowerment (COPE) to advance 
COVID-19 testing and contact tracing. To date, this has 
helped to train more than 900 healthcare providers and 
contact tracers, testing more than 10,000 people and 
providing follow-up and community support, including 
Abbott nutrition products, to more than 2,875 people. 
•  We are working with the Alive Faith Network-Rush 
University Hospital in Chicago and Community-University 
Health Care Center-University of Minnesota in Minneapolis 
to expand mobile COVID-19 testing, treatment and education. 
Our initiatives have targeted the communities at greatest 
risk from the pandemic, including Black and Latino 
communities that suffer from extreme poverty and high 
incidents of diabetes and heart disease.
•  The Abbott Fund’s COVID-19 Community Grant Program 
has partnered with Direct Relief to provide $5 million to 
support 25 federally qualified health centers in the hardest 
hit U.S. states. The program is helping community health 
centers that serve predominantly Black and Latino populations 
by strengthening their capabilities to screen, test, triage and 
treat more than 160,000 COVID-19 patients.  •  In 2019, we announced a three-year partnership with CARE 
and the Abbott Fund to screen, diagnose, prevent and 
manage NCDs for people who remain displaced two years 
after an armed conflict in Marawi City, Philippines. This 
partnership is among the first of its kind to address NCDs in 
areas affected by disasters, conflict and other humanitarian 
challenges, where managing NCDs is difficult but critical.  
–  Program work in Marawi City includes screening to 
identify people with NCDs and those at risk of developing 
NCDs. Nurses and other healthcare providers are trained 
to lead “NCD clubs” to advance disease prevention and 
management through lifestyle changes and compliance 
with ongoing treatment.  
–  The program also focuses on expanding access to needed 
clinical care and strengthening the ability of local healthcare 
systems to manage NCDs. In addition, campaigns are 
raising awareness and educating on the prevention and 
control of NCDs from the community to the national 
government level. 
–   To support this partnership, the Abbott Fund is providing  
$1 million in funding, and Abbott is donating rapid-testing 
technology, diabetes monitors and test strips to help 
advance these efforts to address diabetes in affected 
communities. 
–  Initial results from the program have been promising. More 
than half (51%) of diabetic and prediabetic patients saw a 
decrease in their fasting blood glucose levels since baseline, 
and 46% saw a decrease in their average blood glucose 
(HbA1c) levels, which is an indicator of better glucose 
control and lower risk of complications.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      163

Our 2030 Goals
•  We have aligned our 2030 Sustainability Plan and our  
water management technical standard, which governs our 
operational water management, with the principles of a 
context-based approach. Our Plan includes the following 
water-related targets for 2030: 
–  Achieve water stewardship certification at all high-water 
impact manufacturing sites in water-stressed areas. 
–  Implement accredited water stewardship management 
practices in more than 75% of all manufacturing sites 
operating in water-stressed areas. 
–  Work with 50 key suppliers in high water-stressed areas  
to reduce risks to water quality and quantity for Abbott 
and the community. Water Commitments/Goals
•  Abbott recognizes that water is critical to sustaining life, 
human health, economic growth and ecosystems. It is also 
essential to Abbott’s business continuity and manufacturing 
operations and plays a critical role in the use of many of our 
products. We are committed to managing our water use in an 
efficient, responsible manner, as well as to improving access 
to clean water for our customers and for the communities in 
which we operate.

6.4Water Risk Management/Reduction Initiatives
We are leveraging our Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) 
membership and resources and World Resources Institute 
(WRI) resources to develop a context-based approach to 
water management that monitors water impacts across the 
water catchment basin in which we operate and from which 
we source.
•  In 2020, we implemented 16 water efficiency and reduction 
projects at 12 manufacturing sites across six countries, four 
of which operate in water-stressed areas. These projects 
included technology and process modifications, landscaping 
that reduces watering requirements and uses smart 
irrigation technologies, and recycling water in our building 
and manufacturing operations. Together, the projects 
implemented in 2020 resulted in a savings of approximately 
$120,000 and 14.6 million gallons of water per year.Water Performance
•  We met our target to reduce Abbott’s total water intake by 
30% by 2020, compared to 2010 and adjusted for sales. At 
the end of 2020, we had reduced our water intake compared 
to 2010 by 4.1% on an absolute basis and 34% when adjusted 
for sales.
•  Abbott’s total water intake in 2020 was 3.49 billion gallons,  
a 2% decrease compared to 2019. During 2020, we  
recycled and reused 17% of water at sites employing water 
recycling practices. In addition, the number of facilities  
with water recycling activities also increased from 25 to 29 
manufacturing sites.
•  In 2020, 28 of our 112 manufacturing and R&D sites operated 
in water-stressed regions. However, more than 54% of the 
sites in water-stressed areas each used less than 15 million 
gallons of water. This minimized Abbott manufacturing and 
R&D site exposure to water risk, as well as minimized our 
impacts in water-stressed areas where we operate.

150% increase in spending with Black- and women-owned 
businesses by 2025, from a 2020 baseline.
•  Achieve gender balance in STEM roles with at least  
45% female representation.
Supplier Diversity Programs
•  In 2020, we continued to prioritize our efforts to increase 
our spend with minority-, women- and LGBTQ-owned 
businesses. We also continued to strengthen our supplier 
diversity Tier 2 program, working with key and strategic 
suppliers to encourage them to increase their own  
supplier diversity. 
•  Abbott’s efforts to support supply chain diversity include  
our partnerships with the Council for Supplier Diversityand Chicago United, through which we have developed the 
Abbott Supplier Diversity Connections and Five Forward 
program. Abbott also continues to play an active role within 
the Diverse Manufacturing Supply Chain Alliance (DMSCA), 
which supports small and minority-owned manufacturing 
suppliers bringing innovative solutions to market.
Impact of Supplier Diversity Programs
•  In 2020, we completed an economic impact analysis to 
understand how partnering with diverse and small businesses 
has a positive impact on business growth, employment and 
revenue. From this analysis, we found that our 2019 supplier 
diversity program supported more than 9,400 jobs and had 
an economic impact of $1.9 billion in the communities where 
our diverse suppliers operate in the United States and 
Puerto Rico.  
•  In 2020, we surpassed $2 billion in spend with diverse and 
small businesses for the first time increasing our economic 
impact beyond that of 2019. During 2020, we worked with 
5,575 diverse and small businesses, representing $2.3 billion 
in procurement spend, an increase of 23% from 2019 to 
2020. During this same time frame, our spend with small 
businesses increased 19% and spend with minority-owned 
businesses increased 39%.

•  Addressing 50 million pounds of packaging through 
high-impact sustainable design programs that: 
–  Employ circularity principles through smart design and 
material selection. 
– Eliminate and reduce materials. 
– Improve the energy efficiency of Abbott’s products. 
– Optimize packaging, pallet and truckload efficiency. 
•  Reducing waste impacts using a circular economy approach 
to achieve and maintain at least a 90% waste diversion rate. 
•  Engaging with key suppliers to reduce the environmental 
impact of materials supplied to Abbott that become waste  
in our operations.
Waste Reduction Initiatives
•  In 2012, we launched Abbott’s Zero Waste to Landfill 
program to provide our sites with a clear target for diverting 
waste away from landfill. In total, 31 Abbott manufacturing 
facilities and seven nonmanufacturing facilities, located 
across 18 countries, have now achieved Zero Waste to 
Landfill status. Besides reducing waste, the program also 
cuts greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, saves costs, helps  
to engage employees in our environmental initiatives and 
motivates sites to direct waste to higher levels of waste 
management. •  Our technical standard for evaluating and approving waste 
vendors mandates ethical and responsible approaches  
to waste management and is designed to minimize  
risks associated with any waste that we dispose of. For 
manufacturing sites that produce more than 1,200 kilograms 
of hazardous waste annually, our Waste Vendor Assessment 
program requires on-site audits of our waste management 
firms at least every five years. This program has assessed  
807 waste vendors within the last five years and 172 waste 
vendors in 2020.  
•  Our IT standard for evaluating and approving waste vendors 
is used to ensure that responsible recycling of IT waste and 
controls are in place for resale of viable assets. Our electronic 
equipment reuse and recycling program recycled 162 U.S. 
tons and resold 61 U.S. tons of electronic equipment in 2020. 
Our IT program supports our waste strategy of keeping 
materials in use and reducing raw material inputs by reusing 
or recycling IT-related materials and waste.

13.2Waste Performance 
•  In 2020, we produced 66,847 tons of waste, an absolute 
decrease of 5% compared to 2019. Since 2010, we have 
reduced our total waste footprint by 22% on an absolute 
basis and by 47% when adjusted for sales, nearly achieving 
our 2020 50% reduction target.
•  In partnership with our global electronic waste partners, we 
recycled 162 tons and resold 61 tons of electronic equipment.  
•  Through our efforts to maximize the economic value of 
material over time, we diverted 90% of our operational 
waste and beneficial-use materials from landfill and 
incineration without energy recovery. In 2020, our beneficial- 
use activities exceeded the total waste that Abbott generated 
by 59.9%, with 106,917 tons of materials beneficially used 
across 88 sites in 26 countries. This included composting 
1,146 tons of cafeteria waste. Packaging Reductions 
Abbott’s cross-functional Packaging Council set an aggressive 
target to reduce the total weight of packaging for Abbott 
products by 10% by 2020, compared to our 2010 baseline.  
We surpassed this initial goal in 2017 and continued to build 
on that progress through 2020. By the end of 2020, we had 
reduced our total weight of packaging by 14.2% compared  
to 2010. Through this achievement, we have eliminated 
approximately 42.1 million pounds of packaging and saved 
more than $100 million since 2010.  
Emissions Reductions Goals
•  In 2012, we set an ambitious target to reduce our Scope 1 and 
2 emissions by 40% by 2020, compared to 2010 and adjusted 
for sales. We exceeded this target in 2019 and continued to 
build on this progress in 2020. By the end of the year, we  
had achieved a 50% reduction compared to 2010 levels. 
•  Under our 2030 Sustainability Plan, we have set new targets 
to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% compared to our 2018 baseline. This aligns our sustainability 
plan with the objectives of the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi), well below the two-degree warming scenario. 
•  In addition to this, we are working to develop a 2030 target 
for Scope 3 emissions and will work with our key carbon- 
intensive suppliers to implement sustainable programs to 
reduce these emissions.OVERVIEW   /   ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY   /   DATA   /   OUR PEOPLE   /   ENVIRONMENT   /   SUPPLY CHAIN   /   FOUNDATIONS   /   REPORTING   /   INDICESABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT      169

13.2Energy/Emissions Reduction Initiatives  
We have established a comprehensive management program 
for reducing Abbott’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which 
includes purchasing more renewable electricity, increasing 
energy efficiency across our operations and integrating 
sustainable engineering technologies and concepts into our 
projects. Each of Abbott’s businesses and divisions sets annual 
energy-efficiency targets. In addition, all manufacturing sites 
that produce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of more than 
25,000 metric tons of CO2e annually are required to set annual 
carbon reduction goals.
Using cleaner sources of energy:
•  Since 2017 , our greatest carbon reductions were achieved 
through the purchase of electricity from utility providers 
that included above-average renewable generation in  
their energy mix, particularly in Europe. We purchased  
170 million kilowatt-hours of low-carbon energy in 2020. 
This resulted in savings of 78,000 metric tons of CO2e.
•  We aim to further reduce Abbott’s GHG emissions by 
investing in low-carbon fuels, cogeneration and renewable 
energy generation at our facilities. In 2020, six of our 
facilities used cogeneration units, which are power-generating 
units that produce electricity and capture heat for use in 
manufacturing processes. We produced 59 million kilowatt- 
hours of electricity through cogeneration in 2020, an 
increase of 68% since 2010. In total, we generated 1.5 million 
kilowatt-hours of energy at our sites, mostly through  
solar panels.  Using energy more efficiently:
In 2020, we implemented 54 energy efficiency and air 
emissions projects at 28 manufacturing sites in eight countries. 
These projects resulted in more than $1.1 million annual  
cost savings and more than 30 million kilowatt-hours in 
annual energy savings, preventing more than 8,900 metric 
tons of CO2e emissions. In several cases, we achieved 
significant savings by upgrading and optimizing building 
control technologies, HVAC systems, and manufacturing 
processes and equipment.
Fuel-efficient initiatives:
•  We have launched a number of long-term initiatives to 
manage fuel consumption in our commercial fleet, which 
contributed to 25% of our Scope 1 emissions in 2020. These 
initiatives include requirements for more fuel-efficient 
vehicles, car-sharing programs and campaigns encouraging 
our employees to use public transportation in urban  
environments.  
•  During the COVID-19 pandemic, we encouraged our sales 
teams to work from home where possible, with the exception 
of those providing commercial support to hospitals. This 
resulted in a significant reduction in fuel consumption for 
our commercial fleet and contributed to a reduction in  
Scope 1 emissions. Offsetting this, disruption caused by  
the pandemic meant that we could rely less on our most 
fuel-efficient modes of transportation when it came to 
delivering COVID-19 tests and other Abbott products when  
and where they were needed.

Across a nearly 20-year partnership with the Tanzania 
Ministry of Health, Abbott and the Abbott Fund have invested 
more than $130 million and helped accomplish the shared goal 
of bringing positive change to Tanzania’s healthcare system. 
Together, Abbott, the Abbott Fund and the government of 
Tanzania have created a model for public-private partnership 
and developed sustainable improvements in the quality of 
testing, treatment and care across the country. In addition, 
Abbott also is continuing our work to serve the country’s most 
vulnerable communities, with a focus on strengthening 
education, protecting the legal rights of women and children, 
and providing sustainable economic opportunities.Second-Generation Health Posts in Rwanda
In Rwanda, Abbott has identified an opportunity to create 
shared impact by supporting the Rwandan Ministry of 
Health’s program to close the rural healthcare gap. Beginning 
with eight pilot locations in the Bugesera district in 2019, we 
worked with the Ministry of Health to develop a model for 
second-generation health posts that can provide much-needed 
maternity wards and antenatal care. The posts also offer HIV 
testing, treatment for infectious diseases (such as malaria, 
respiratory infections and intestinal parasites), pharmacy 
services and health education. The posts are also quickly  
becoming a destination for the management of common  
noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension.
