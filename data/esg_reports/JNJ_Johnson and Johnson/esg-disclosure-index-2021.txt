2021 ESG Disclosure Index
Johnson & Johnson reports against several global ESG-focused indices and frameworks 
to provide investors and other key stakeholders a consistent and comparable accounting 
of our performance and progress. Reviewed together with our Health for Humanity Report 
and ESG Policies & Positions, these ESG disclosures offer a detailed and holistic view of 
the implementation of our strategy and resulting outcomes and impacts. We disclose our 
performance against the following suite of ESG standards and frameworks: the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option; GRI’s Culture of Health for Business (COH4B) 
framework; Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) relevant Standards: HC-BP, 
HC-MS, CG-HP; Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), building on our 
responses to the CDP climate change questionnaire; Norges Bank Investment Management 
and Basel Institute on Governance’s “Measuring effectiveness of anti-corruption programmes” 
reporting framework, adding disclosures against this set of 17 indicators; and UN Global 
Compact (UNGC). This Report serves as our UNGC annual Communication on Progress.Contents
Note: All Johnson & Johnson Environmental, Social and Governance Policies & Positions are published on our website in addition to being  
referenced in our annual Health for Humanity Report. Look for        ESG Policies & Positions throughout the Report to indicate sections where  
we have supporting ESG Policies and Positions and click to learn more.2

GRI Culture of Health for Business Framework
For the second year, we report our performance against Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)’s framework, the Culture of Health for 
Business (COH4B) practices and metrics. In 2020, GRI, in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, published a new 
framework called the COH4B as part of a goal to stimulate private sector contribution to health through the practice of sustainability 
reporting. The publication followed two years of consultation and development, in which Johnson & Johnson participated as a 
member of the COH4B Advisory Committee. 
In the following disclosure, we report our performance against COH4B practices and metrics.
COH4B Practice & Definition Approach Metrics
Strategy
1.  Health culture: Promoting an organizational 
culture of health (over and above wellness and 
health promotion program)At Johnson & Johnson, we believe that advancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of our 
own people. We aspire to have the healthiest workforce in the world and are taking steps through one of our 
Health for Humanity Goals to create an engaged, energized and high-performing culture within our organization. 
See our section on Employee Health, Safety & Wellness . Over the years, we have continuously expanded health 
and well-being programs throughout Johnson & Johnson and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and 
technologies to keep our offerings best in class and help employees make the healthy choice the easy choice. 
See our Position on Employee Health and Well-Being .GRI 102-16, 403(2018)
See Health for Humanity 2025 Goals Scorecard
2.  Responsible corporate political activity: Activity 
that shapes public policy or public opinionJohnson & Johnson is active in several areas that advance public policy and in particular, improved health 
systems, access to healthcare and universal health coverage (UHC). See our Position on Universal Health 
Coverage . See also our Position on Stakeholder Engagement for a range of industry associations we support in 
their advocacy efforts to improve healthcare and responsible business. We believe it is important to encourage 
the development of sound public policy, best achieved when a variety of stakeholders are involved. We support 
active and informed participation in the policy-making and political processes. We use our voice to pursue 
policy solutions that better serve patients, nurses, doctors, and consumers, as well as our employees and our 
communities around the globe. See our section on Political Engagement for more information.Not applicable
3.  Responsible marketing practices: Commitments 
to responsible marketing including labeling 
transparencyAt Johnson & Johnson, we strive to operate with the highest standards of business conduct and transparency 
through all communications with patients, consumers, healthcare providers and other stakeholders. We are 
committed to responsible, ethical and patient-centered sales and marketing practices for our Pharmaceutical, 
MedTech and Consumer Health products and services. See our Position on Ethical Sales and Marketing, our 
Position on Responsible Interaction with Healthcare Professionals and our Statement on Interactions with  
Patient Organizations .See Compliance-Related Allegations Investigated

4.  Health promotion & wellness: Health initiatives 
that generally offer screening, prevention and

Workforce and Operations
9.  Work time: Managing working hours, schedules 
and schedule controlWe strive to ensure that all employment complies with all applicable laws and regulations in every country in 
which we operate, including those concerning hours of work and rest. We respect limits for overtime work 
and irregular work hours, including weekends and national or religious holidays. We do not force employees 
to work overtime, and we compensate those who do in a fair and proper manner, always in line with the law 
as a minimum standard.  In 2021, we examined the potential risk of excessive work hours for employees in our 
operations. Our assessment included an evaluation of hours worked in specific sites. The findings from this 
assessment will inform the development of a global guideline to limit work hours to 60 hours per week (including 
overtime) for wage employees, in line with International Labour Organization conventions. See our section on 
Human Rights and our Position on Employment and Labor Rights.GRI 402(2016), 401-1
10.  Job security: Managing job insecurity as 
perceived (by the employee) or attributed (by 
researchers)Our Credo states: “There must be equal opportunity for employment, development and advancement for those 
qualified. We must provide highly capable leaders and their actions must be just and ethical.” We aim to attract 
and retain our employees for the long term, and engage with all our employees to provide job continuity and 
growth, facilitating learning and development for each. Our learning culture supports developing and retaining 
our talent. See our Position on Employee Development.GRI 402(2016), 401-1, 402-1
11.  Pay practices: Managing wage policies, 
minimum wages, wage satisfactionWe support the right of individuals to fair compensation for their work and aim to provide competitive 
compensation and valuable benefits for employees at all levels. We always observe legal minimum wage 
provisions and often exceed these. See our Position on Employee Compensation and Benefits.GRI 102-38
12.  Occupational health & safety: Mandatory and 
voluntary occupational health and safetyWe actively promote a culture of caring, accountability, proactivity, learning, transparency and inclusion. We 
foster an Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) culture where everyone is responsible for their safety, and 
the safety of others. The EH&S culture at Johnson & Johnson inspires every employee to make safety and 
environmental responsibility not only a way of working, but also a way of living, all day, every day. See our 
Environmental Health and Safety Policy .GRI 403(2018)
13.  Physical environment: Managing air quality, 
lighting, green buildings, attempts to promote 
health through the built environment other than 
through occupational health and safetyWe maintain workspaces designed to promote healthy lifestyles, employee engagement and collaborative 
working. Our Workplace Innovation Program, established in 2010, helps us better design our environments 
to support workplace activity, create shared and “unassigned” workspace for greater flexibility, offer healthy 
working environments, enhance employees’ working experience, and inspire an innovative and engaged 
work culture. Our workplaces incorporate elements that support physical and emotional health, such as on-
site fitness centers, first aid rooms, outdoor activity areas, nurture and faith rooms, rooms for counseling and 
employee assistance, and child development centers. We also adopt green building design principles in planning 
or renovating our workplaces to further enhance the health, safety, well-being and productivity of our people. 
Many of our workplaces are housed in LEED-certified buildings.See LEED Buildings table in ESG Performance Data24

HC-MS-240a.2 Description of how price information for each product is disclosed to customers or to  
their agentsJohnson & Johnson MedTech offers tens of thousands of individual medical devices. Each of our 
companies sets, and makes available to customers, a list price for each of its devices. We also extend 
discounts and rebates. These price concessions may be based upon volume, market share or other 
factors; and may be at the product code, construct (such as a complete hip or knee), or product category 
level (such as all orthopaedic trauma products); and may span multiple business lines (such as all trauma, 
joint reconstruction and spine orthopaedic products) consistent with applicable antitrust and fair trade 
practices laws. Usually, these price concessions are included in executed contracts, either directly with 
a customer or with its group purchasing organization or other purchasing group, and those contracts are 
often the result of a competitive bidding process. For direct sales, the discounted price points would also 
be reflected on invoices delivered to the customer, and rebate amounts would be disclosed in writing via a 
rebate memorandum delivered to the customer when the rebate is paid. Under applicable U.S. regulatory 
guidance, certain fees paid to purchasing groups must be treated as discounts by members of that group. 
We also have contracts with third parties authorizing them to distribute certain products. Purchases made 
through an authorized distributor (indirect sales) are subject to the terms negotiated directly between the 
distributor and the customer (e.g., payment terms, service fees, shipping fees and product surcharges). 
We recognize the important role that our devices play in healthcare, and endeavor to make our devices 
available to healthcare providers at a fair price. Therefore, our approach allows flexibility to offer customer-
appropriate price points to better ensure access and affordability for different healthcare providers, with 
different characteristics, serving different communities.

C1.2aa)   Describe the Board’s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.  
 
Position of the individual on the Board with responsibility for climate-related issues  
Johnson & Johnson’s corporate governance structure is comprised of a Board of Directors, represented by independent Directors and the Executive Chairman and 
CEO as Johnson & Johnson employees, and an internal management leadership group — the Executive Committee. The individual with responsibility for climate-
related issues is the Executive Vice President & Chief Global Supply Chain Officer. As a member of the Executive Committee, and a management representative on 
the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors’ Regulatory Compliance Committee (RCC) and Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee (STSC), this position has 
direct oversight of the Environmental Health and Safety and Enterprise Sustainability Departments. Responsibility for climate-related issues resides with this position 
because it has direct responsibility for many inter-related climate change risks and opportunities, including all aspects of supply chain and procurement for Johnson 
& Johnson’s business segments (Consumer Health, MedTech and Pharmaceutical).  
 
Details on Board oversight of climate-related issues 
Monitoring and overseeing progress against goals for addressing climate-related issues is a scheduled agenda item on the Board of Directors’ relevant Committees 
(e.g., STSC). The Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), who leads the Enterprise Sustainability Department, presents updates on the progress toward climate-related 
goals and targets to the STSC at least annually. The CSO provides regular updates (at least quarterly) to the Executive Vice President & Chief Global Supply 
Chain Officer, who is a member of the Company’s Executive Committee, and a management representative of the Board of Directors on the STSC and the RCC. 
The Executive Vice President & Chief Global Supply Chain Officer has ultimate approval over the climate risk strategy, policies and release of climate-related 
information. Key milestones toward our climate goals are included in the scorecard that is used to hold our CEO and senior executives accountable for business 
performance and is reviewed with our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. This scorecard is used as part of the process to determine executive compensation 
and includes both financial (such as sales and earnings per share) and non-financial (such as product quality, product, patient and consumer safety, diversity and 
climate) goals. 
b)  Describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. 
 
The highest management-level positions with responsibility for climate-related issues are the CSO and the Executive Vice President & Chief Global Supply Chain 
Officer. The CSO reports to the Executive Vice President & Chief Global Supply Chain Officer (the highest level of responsibility for climate-related issues), who is 
a member of the Company’s Executive Committee. The CSO is invited to STSC meetings at least annually for environmental sustainability agenda items. Several 
teams directly responsible for environmental sustainability issues, including energy management, waste, water risk and product stewardship compliance, report to 
this position or other supply chain functions such as Environmental Health & Safety or Engineering & Property Services. While these teams own direct management 
of their programs, the CSO position has management oversight of areas identified as priority impacts. Climate change-related issues reside with this position 
because of its responsibility for managing environment-related goals, including Health for Humanity Goals.32

Description of time horizons 
For the purposes of climate disclosure,
 •  Short-term is defined as 1 – 3 years (aligned with a general financial planning time horizon) 
 •  Medium-term as 3 – 10 years (aligned with Johnson & Johnson’s broader strategy and vision used for long-term goals)
 •  Long-term as 10 – 40 years (aligned with long-term projections of climate change and a transition to a low-carbon economy) 
    Climate-related issues for each time horizon that could have substantive financial or strategic impact 
 
    Description of Risks 
 
    Short-term/Medium-term/Long-term 
 
 •  Transition risks from emerging carbon pricing regulations in our direct operations and extended supply chain: As a global company with 260+ operating 
companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world, Johnson & Johnson has facilities in areas with current and pending carbon tax or carbon 
cap and trade schemes. Emerging carbon pricing regulations to mitigate climate change in some or all of the countries in which we operate could increase 
Johnson & Johnson’s operating costs.
 •  Market risks of changing customer behavior: Customer preferences are changing because of increased awareness of the impacts of climate change. This 
in turn impacts our various businesses in different ways—for example, in 2021, at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), a group of 50 
countries committed to develop climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems in response to growing evidence of the impact of climate change on personal 
health. New procurement policies from health system customers could impact our Pharmaceutical or MedTech business. Similarly, many customer segments 
of our Consumer Health business have voiced concerns over the carbon footprint and sustainable sourcing of the products that they procure. Sustainable 
sourcing inquiries can include a number of concerns over climate change impacts such as water scarcity, pollution, environmental practices and deforestation. 
Failure to effectively communicate sustainability-related improvements with consumers, or failure to provide environmentally/climate change-friendly 
products, could cede market space to competitors.
 •  Chronic physical risk associated with changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns: Changes to global climate, extreme 
temperature and natural disasters could affect demand for Johnson & Johnson’s products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution 
networks, and force alterations to certain products and operations. Global warming from the increased concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the 
atmosphere is causing frequent extreme temperature conditions, with direct impacts on facilities, operations, transport, and employee health and productivity. 
We have identified chronic physical risks—including extreme temperature, water stress and drought—as a substantive strategic climate-based risk to our 
operations and supply chain that has the potential to cause disruptions in operations or increase operational costs.33

 Long-term
  •  Acute physical risks of increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events: Increased severe weather events such as storms and flooding could 
lead to higher costs from damage to Johnson & Johnson’s operations, decreased revenue due to disruptions in supply chain and operations, and potential 
incurred costs for supporting workers pre- and post-event. Coastal flooding and fluvial flooding were identified as the primary drivers of financial impact on 
our operations. As a result of more extreme cyclone, hurricane and storm events and changes in sea level over time, it is likely that both coastal flooding and 
fluvial flooding will steadily increase.

Short-term/Medium-term
 •  Resource efficiency and resilience through the adoption of energy- and water-efficiency measures and the utilization of renewable energy: An increase in 
cost from climate change regulation can make the capital investment in renewable energy and energy and water efficiency more attractive, which may reduce 
costs over a longer period of time. While energy costs as a percent of sales is very low for Johnson & Johnson (<1% in 2021), we continuously evaluate and 
implement efficiency and renewable energy projects that reduce our energy consumption and costs. 
 •  Development and/ or expansion of low-emission goods and services: With the increase in the general public’s awareness of climate change, the demand 
for sustainable products is growing each year. Increasingly, our customers—hospitals, government healthcare systems and retailers—are considering 
environmental attributes of products in their procurement decisions. For example, in 2021, at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), a 
group of 50 countries committed to develop climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems in response to growing evidence of the impact of climate change 
on people’s health, which could present opportunities for more sustainable products from our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. Similar opportunities 
are increasing within our Consumer Health business, where there is a growing market for responsible products with sustainable packaging and other climate-
related product attributes.
 
Long-term
 •  Development of new products or services through R&D and innovation: According to The Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, the impacts of 
climate change threaten to undermine decades of progress in healthcare. Shifting weather patterns, changes in air quality and spread of vector-borne diseases 
pose significant risks for people’s health and well-being, particularly in resource-limited settings (Africa, Latin America and Asia, where they have the potential 
to spread more quickly). We anticipate that climate change could impact the progress society has made in global health in many ways, whether through air 
pollution, how infectious diseases emerge and spread (including Neglected Tropical Diseases [NTDs] and pandemic threats such as Ebola and Zika) or shifting 
weather patterns impacting allergies. Given its far-reaching implications and associated public health costs, combating climate change could be a significant 
opportunity to protect public health. Emerging shifts in global disease profiles can be expected to require new products and services to help increase human 
resilience to disease.34

c)  CDP C3.2, 
C3.2a  Description of the process(es) used to determine which risks and opportunities could have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the organization: 
  Financial risks are categorized according to their ability to impact the achievement of strategic and business decisions, including in the context of financial targets 
based upon our global growth drivers and overall business performance. We define substantive financial risk at the Enterprise level in the context of Securities 
and Exchange Commission-required disclosures around “Risk Factors, ” which are publicly disclosed annually in our Form 10-K. These risk factors consider both 
qualitative and quantitative variables in assessing the potential financial impact on the Enterprise. 
  While climate change can be expected to have profound implications on health for humanity, it is not known with precision the exact magnitude or probability of 
future risks and how those may impact Johnson & Johnson. As a result, we use a definition for “substantive strategic impact” that enables us to analyze possible 
futures and put in place programs to increase the resilience of our organization in the face of uncertainty. Substantive strategic impacts are disclosed in this 
Report, which are risks/opportunities with a meaningful impact on reputation and/or public trust, potential for action that could impede Johnson & Johnson from 
manufacturing or distributing some product volume, and are considered possible, likely, more likely or highly likely in the short- to long-term future.
 
b)  Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning.  
 
Impacts on businesses and strategy
•  Products and Services: Risks from climate change could impact products and services in several ways: regulatory risks (e.g., carbon taxes); the availability of raw 
materials; and supply chain disruptions from chronic or acute physical climate change events that could increase the costs of raw materials and energy. This could 
be passed along to the consumer and change the price competitiveness of our products and services, or cause disruptions in supply. Similarly, there are climate-
related opportunities for our business segments as our customers—hospitals, government healthcare systems and retailers—are giving more consideration to 
environmental attributes of products in their procurement decisions. We also anticipate that climate change will impact global health in many ways, including 
how infectious diseases emerge and spread, which may increase the need for new products and services in areas such as NTDs and pandemic preparedness. 
Our Health for Humanity Goals and ESG strategy address several aspects of these risks. To address price competitiveness specifically related to energy, we are 
implementing goals to reduce our emissions (e.g., our Science Based Target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 by 60% by 2030 from a 2016 baseline), which has energy-
saving implications.
•  Supply Chain and/ or Value Chain: We believe that improving supply chain transparency and sustainability creates value by reducing sourcing risks and protecting 
our brand reputation, and can have far-reaching positive impacts on society and the natural environment. As the world’s largest and most broadly based healthcare 
company, Johnson & Johnson maintains operations in many countries of the world and works with more than 45,000 suppliers across our three business segments. 
We manage a highly complex network of supplier relationships that are critical to business success and our ability to fulfill our obligations to those we serve. Risks 
from climate change could impact our supply chain in several ways: regulatory risks that could increase the cost of materials used in our products; physical risks 
(such as droughts and extreme weather events) that have the potential to interrupt supply chains; and reputational risks that could arise from climate issues in our 
supply chain. Our Health for Humanity Goals address sustainable procurement from multiple angles, including reporting and performance. Our participation in the 
CDP Supply Chain program (climate and water) also helps us understand where there are risks and opportunities in our supply chain.35

•  Operations: Risks from climate change may impact operations in several ways, including rising operational costs from carbon regulation and/or rising energy 
costs and chronic/acute physical risk impacts such as water scarcity and/or increased frequency or intensity of hurricanes. In response to these risks, we have 
implemented measures to have capital funding available to reduce current and long-term exposure to operational costs, such as a CO2 Capital Relief Program of 
up to $40 million per year for carbon- and water-reducing projects that has been in place for over 15 years. We have also updated operational processes to assess 
and mitigate impacts from water risk by implementing a program to thoroughly assess and address many aspects of water risk in our operations. Additionally, we 
performed a site risk assessment initiative to identify opportunities and investments required to enhance the resilience of our highest-impact sites located in areas 
where there is an elevated likelihood of disruptive severe weather events (notably flood, earthquake, tsunami, extreme wind and wildfire). 
c)  Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario.
 
 Climate-related scenarios and associated time horizon(s) considered
 In 2018, Johnson & Johnson undertook a qualitative climate-related scenario analysis in line with the TCFD recommendations. Nine existing climate scenarios were 
evaluated covering transitional and physical risks, with the International Energy Agency’s 2018 World Energy Outlook selected as a reference for transitional risks 
and the IPCC AR5 selected as reference for physical risks. Business as Usual (BAU) scenarios included the Current Policies Scenario (6C) for transition risks and 
Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 for physical risks; Low Carbon Scenarios included the Sustainable Development Scenarios for transitional risks and 
RCP 4.5 for physical risks. Time horizons considered were up to 2040 for transitional risks, and up to 2100 for physical risks. Indicators were developed and assessed 
under a BAU and Low-Carbon scenario in order to categorize overall impact and preparedness to mitigate risk or capitalize opportunity. Johnson & Johnson 
considered both direct operations and supply chain in areas of energy pricing, political stability, global disease profiles, technological changes, consumer awareness, 
physical impacts and deforestation. 36

The values that guide our decision-making are spelled out in Our Credo , written over 75 years ago. Our Credo challenges us to put the needs and well-being of the 
people we serve first and sets the tone and values of our organization.  
 
Johnson & Johnson’s process to identify, assess and respond to climate-related risks and opportunities is integrated into a multi-disciplinary Company-wide risk 
management process that covers all stages of the value chain (direct operations, upstream and downstream) for climate-related risks such as current regulation, 
emerging regulation, technology, legal, market, reputation, acute physical and chronic physical impacts. This assessment covers short-, medium-, and long-term 
horizons and is integrated into the Johnson & Johnson Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework .  
 
The Johnson & Johnson ERM framework helps identify potential events that may affect the Enterprise, manage the associated risks and opportunities, and provide 
reasonable assurance that our Company’s objectives will be achieved. Our approach to ERM is informed by principles outlined by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Climate-related risks are integrated into this Company-wide risk management process. 
 
The Johnson & Johnson ERM Framework comprises five intertwined components: 
 
1)  Strategy & objective-setting: The Executive Committee (EC) establishes overarching strategic goals and sets financial targets based upon our Global Growth 
Drivers. These goals are cascaded to our businesses around the world, ensuring alignment across the Enterprise. Senior management is accountable for  
meeting these goals and objectives. Business unit, Enterprise function and individual employee goals and objectives are typically aligned to those of the  
overall organization. 
 2)  Performance: Internal and external issues and events affecting our ability to achieve established objectives are typically identified at various points in the 
business cycle. During planning and review processes, business unit management assesses the marketplace and competitive environment, including megatrends, 
to identify risks and opportunities facing their business. The various ERM functions provide expertise, support and input into the process as needed. Business 
leaders, in partnership with the applicable ERM functions, determine the appropriate way to address identified risks. The activity or situation posing the risk may 
be avoided, accepted, reduced, shared or transferred, depending on the facts and circumstances. To help ensure risk responses are consistently implemented, 
ERM functions may set policies, define minimum standards and/or issue guidelines that apply to Johnson & Johnson business activities. ERM functions help 
support the implementation of these policies, standards and guidelines through monitoring tools, including self-assessments, that enable local leaders to 
understand where controls are necessary as well as where improvement may be required.37

 3)  Review & revision: Critical to our ERM framework is a review and reporting process to ensure risks are effectively assessed and appropriate risk responses and 
controls are in place. Testing, auditing and assessments are typically performed by personnel who don’t report into the business in order to provide assurance that 
risk responses are being implemented, procedures are understood and followed, and appropriate controls are in place.
 4)  Information, Communication & Reporting: Information and communication channels are in place, so business leaders and employees are aware of risks that 
fall into their area of responsibility. Key Enterprise risk functions meet regularly with the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors, the EC, each business segment 
leadership team and select other senior leadership teams to ensure visibility and ownership of critical risks. Policies and procedures are in place that require 
incidents of noncompliance, adverse events, control failures or critical unmitigated risks to be escalated to senior management and, if appropriate, the proper 
authorities in a timely manner. Corrective and preventive actions are determined as appropriate to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.
 5)  Governance & Oversight: Our Board of Directors provides oversight of senior leadership’s management of the various risks the Company faces. The Board meets 
at regular intervals with EC members, other senior business leaders and leaders of Enterprise risk functions to discuss risk factors related to the Company. It also 
receives regular reports from senior representatives of the Company’s independent auditor. The EC establishes overarching strategic goals and oversees the 
business segments as well as the Enterprise risk functions, which are functionally independent from commercial interests. Johnson & Johnson business leaders 
are accountable for managing risks affecting their respective business segments and the overall Enterprise. Enterprise risk functions are responsible for identifying 
and assessing risks to business leaders and collaborating with them to find effective ways to manage identified risks.38

Stakeholders are increasingly interested in a business’s broader role in society, beyond financial returns, and want to know more 
about a company’s policies, practices, and disclosures that may impact its ability to generate long-term value for all stakeholders. 
Responsible business practices serve as the foundation of our Company’s success and are imperative to protect the broader 
healthcare system and the communities in which we live and work. It starts with a culture of ethical leadership and integrity 
delivered by a diverse, skilled workforce committed to serving the patients, customers, consumers and all others who count on us to 
provide high-quality, safe and reliable products; operate with integrity; and engage in responsible business practices.
In 2020, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) published a guidance note containing a set of indicators that companies 
may wish to consider when reporting on the effectiveness of their anti-corruption efforts to external stakeholders. The indicators 
cover: culture, risk management, third parties, compliance function and oversight. The guidance note, which includes additional 
information on supporting indicator descriptors, can be found here.
To continue building and sustaining the trust earned over the course of 135 years of business operations, we are disclosing how 
Our Credo values and purpose-driven approach to change the course of human health are reflected in in our performance on anti-
corruption efforts in line with NBIM guidance and indicators.Norges Bank Investment Management
Indicator Description Disclosure
 Culture
1.1 A baseline has been established to 
identify perceptions of the ethical 
culture/culture of integrity in the 
company. There is a methodology 
to measure/gauge changes to the 
culture over time.We have established a baseline to measure integrity through a question in our biennial “Our Voice Survey, ” which asks employees to rate the statement, “Leaders  
in my organization demonstrate that integrity, quality and compliance are top priorities through their words and actions. ” We augment this survey’s findings with  
results of the “Our Credo Survey, ” which is fielded in alternate years, where employees are asked to rate how Johnson & Johnson “acts responsibly to the  
communities in which we live and work and the world community as well. ” Crafted in 1943, Our Credo spells out the values that guide our decisions and actions  
in conducting business.
These surveys are administered in 78 countries and made available in 36 languages. Following analysis of the detailed results of these surveys, which is  
communicated to all employees, we develop plans to address the main areas of opportunity identified by our employees’ feedback, both at the Enterprise level  
and within individual teams.
1.2 The frequency (could be a 
percentage or absolute number) 
of references to ethics and 
compliance communicated 
internally and/or externally by the

our employees. It is reinforced and included in the annual goals and objectives, which serve as a guide for our operating companies, and communicated at all levels  
of Johnson & Johnson, both internally and externally.

hold each other accountable to the highest standards of ethical behavior.
•  The CCO is actively engaged with peer organizations in benchmarking groups to help shape industry-wide discussions, positions and disclosures on ethics and 
compliance-related topics.
1.3 Does your performance 
management framework 
incorporate how ethics and 
integrity objectives are achieved 
(Y/N)?Yes. Employee performance at Johnson & Johnson is measured in two dimensions: the “what” they achieved and the “how” they achieved those results. Our Leadership 
Imperatives set the performance behavioral expectations for all employees—the “how. ” Business integrity, ethics and compliance are integrated into all ways “how” our 
employees achieve their goals and objectives, and play a special role in the Our Credo & Our Purpose Leadership Imperative. All employees have individual performance 
development plans whereby the Leadership Imperatives give our employees across all geographies, businesses, roles and levels a clear and consistent way to lead 
Johnson & Johnson into the future. Both “what” and “how” factor equally in determining an individual’s compensation.
All our employees formally discuss their progress and plan their professional development with their managers five times each year, in our “5 Conversations” framework; 
this is in addition to informal, ongoing discussions throughout the balance of the year. Year-end conversations about overall performance include assessing business results 
achieved and the degree to which our leadership behaviors were demonstrated in how those results were achieved.
1.4 Ethics and integrity are integral 
components in leadership 
decisions.Our performance management process incorporates integrity in “how” an individual achieves goals and objectives. Compliance and ethical leadership are also part of 
the performance assessment, including for our most senior leaders. Senior leaders are also required to certify the compliance of their organizations with the Johnson & 
Johnson Code of Business Conduct.  Certifiers include senior leaders at Vice President 2 level and above, selected Managing Directors and General Managers based on 
country or business segment risk profile, and executives of recently acquired companies. We also embed business integrity and ethics questions into our hiring practices 
and critical talent assessments to determine a candidate’s judgment and alignment with Our Credo values of ethics and integrity.43

 Culture
1.5 The company actively engages in 
anti-corruption Collective Action.We engage in numerous collective action efforts to tackle corruption and bribery, and to raise standards of business integrity among business and other industry 
partners. We collaborate and maintain sustained cooperation between stakeholders in the private and public sectors, civil society and other international 
organizations. Johnson & Johnson has committed to engaging in anti-corruption collective action initiatives, including Transparency International UK and the United 
Nations Global Compact (signatory since 2013), and to following industry association codes, including: 
•  The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) Code of Practice 
•  The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) Code of Practice 
•  The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Codes and Guidelines 
•  The Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) Code of Ethics 
•  The MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice (for which Johnson & Johnson helped to create, and now chairs, a Code committee at MedTech Europe) 
•  Mecomed, the medical devices, imaging and diagnostics trade association for the Middle East and Africa
•  The Asia Pacific Medical Technology Association (APACMed), where Johnson & Johnson led the work to develop its Code of Ethical Conduct and whose Company 
Group Chairman for Medical Devices, Asia Pacific, chairs the APACMed Legal, Ethics and Compliance Committee.
Johnson & Johnson also participates in the annual Transparency International UK Corporate Anti-Corruption Benchmark Survey and Quarterly Deep Dive Workshops 
with peer companies. The Benchmark Survey measures and compares our anti-corruption program performance against our best practice standards—including 
compliance regulations—and also against best practice standards across the entire business community. Our survey results are also validated by an independent third 
party. The Quarterly Deep Dive Workshops enable practice-sharing and learning opportunities with other companies. Our participation in the Benchmark Survey and 
Quarterly Deep Dive Workshops supports our review and oversight of our global anti-corruption compliance program and enables identification and prioritization of 
compliance program improvement opportunities.
Risk Management
2.1  The company has an anti-
corruption compliance risk 
programme which it uses to 
give regular updates to senior 
management and board on how 
risks are being managed.Johnson & Johnson’s anti-corruption compliance program is governed by the Anti-Corruption Program Office, which is housed within the Company’s Health Care 
Compliance organization. The Anti-Corruption Program Office works cross-functionally using the Johnson & Johnson Enterprise Risk Management Framework to guide 
its efforts to identify, prioritize, manage, mitigate and remediate Enterprise risks. Results of risk assessments, monitoring and audits are shared regularly with relevant 
operating company management, Johnson & Johnson leadership, the Board of Directors and its Regulatory Compliance Committee.
2.2 The percentage of business 
functions that are included in the 
anti-corruption risk assessment.Our anti-corruption risk assessments cover all Johnson & Johnson operating companies and business functions.
2.3 The company has established 
anti-corruption compliance KPIs 
that are used to measure the 
compliance programmeAll Johnson & Johnson operating companies and business functions have established mechanisms and measures to ensure anti-corruption compliance program elements 
are in place to identify risks and prevent non-compliance. These key performance indicators are captured and tracked on a regular basis. Examples include tracking of risk 
assessment results and related mitigation activities, training completion and knowledge transfer results, and tracking of remediation.44

 Third Parties
3.1 Percentage of third-party reviews 
conducted.We broadly assess risk across all third-party intermediaries (TPIs), and then have a more focused and detailed annual risk assessment process for the higher-risk  
TPIs that determines which of them are selected for Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) process reviews by our Global Audit & Assurance organization.  
Additional information on our process for risk assessments is in our Position on Anti-Corruption.
3.2 How the findings from third-party 
reviews are addressed.Health Care Compliance, Law Department and Global Audit & Assurance staff work directly with operating company management to address findings from  
third-party reviews.
Johnson & Johnson provides the third-party intermediary (TPI) with an indication of the findings and recommendations for remediation efforts. Where needed, Johnson & 
Johnson will facilitate compliance program development for the TPI by providing both training and a compliance program toolkit or an app to support  
TPI field staff.
3.3 Percentage of third parties that 
improve their anti-corruption 
compliance programmes.A majority of third parties with whom we are engaging are responsive to our findings for improvement of their anti-corruption compliance programs. Doing so is a  
critical factor for a continuing relationship between Johnson & Johnson and a third party. Results of due diligence, ongoing monitoring, red flag mitigation and internal 
audits are shared with third-party intermediaries, and are tracked regularly for on-time completion by various teams in the Johnson & Johnson compliance functions, 
including our Third-Party Intermediary Ethics & Compliance organization.
 Compliance Function
4.1 The organisational structure of the 
company is transparent, including 
the location of the compliance 
function within the structure, 
and it identifies where the Chief 
Compliance Officer is situated.Our Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) is a key member of the General Counsel’s Organizational Leadership Team, with accountability to the Chief Executive Officer  
and the Regulatory Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. Our CCO’s role is detailed on our Company’s external website and in our Johnson & Johnson 
Enterprise Risk Management Framework. Our CCO co-leads the Johnson & Johnson Corporate Compliance Committee, along with our Chief Quality Officer. The 
Corporate Compliance Committee is the primary governance structure for coordinating compliance-related risks across core risk functions. The CCO also chairs the 
Company’s Triage Committee, which investigates compliance-related allegations.
4.2 The governance structure of 
the company enables the Chief 
Compliance Officer to execute 
her/his responsibilities impartially.The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) has direct and unencumbered access to the Chief Executive Officer and the Regulatory Compliance Committee (RCC) of the  
Board of Directors, and also meets privately with the RCC. Such access allows our CCO to act independently and in the best interest of ethical business conduct.
Our compliance structure comprises experienced and qualified professionals across the organization, who are functionally independent from commercial interests and

 Compliance Function
4.3 Ethics and integrity are integral 
components in all talent and 
leadership development 
programmes.Compliance and ethical leadership are part of the performance assessment, including for our most senior leaders. Senior leaders are also required to certify the 
compliance of their organizations with the Johnson & Johnson Code of Business Conduct (CBC).  Certifiers include senior leaders at Vice President 2 level and above, 
selected Managing Directors and General Managers based on country or business segment risk profile, and executives of recently acquired companies. All new 
employees are assigned and required to complete CBC training. 
In addition to senior leader performance assessments, guided by Our Credo that “[employee] actions must be just and ethical, ” we know that fostering a culture that is 
values-based, responsible, ethical and inclusive motivates and empowers our employees. Our Leadership Imperatives provide a framework for our annual goals and 
objectives, development programs and training materials. As outlined in the Leadership Imperatives, our employees globally are expected to live Our Credo and pursue 
Our Purpose by advancing the highest standards of quality, safety, compliance and ethics. Our performance and evaluation process are grounded in assessing progress 
and performance toward achieving these goals and objectives.
4.4 The program is adequately 
resourced and empowered to 
function effectively.Each Johnson & Johnson operating company exercises compliance oversight, and management ensures adequate compliance resources are in place. Johnson & Johnson 
Health Care Compliance Officers (HCCOs) are assigned to help lead, oversee and monitor the implementation of the compliance program at each operating company. 
Budgets are evaluated several times during the year and adjusted as needed. Each HCCO maintains direct and unencumbered access to the operating company’s General 
Manager (i.e., President or Managing Director, or most senior leader of the company), and to our Law Department, Global Audit & Assurance, the Johnson & Johnson 
Chief Compliance Officer and other Health Care Compliance leaders
