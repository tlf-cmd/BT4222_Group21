1 Why? Because when the world 
thrives, businesses thrive. 
 Businesses are part of 
the global ecosystem. And 
ecosystems, by definition, require 
balance and diversity. They also 
require a point of view larger 
than oneself and longer than the 
immediate future. They require 
an understanding that we are 
stronger as a connected whole 
than as isolated actors.
 At Mastercard, this is what 
we call the network effect: the 
idea that the value of the total 
is greater than the sum of its 
parts, and that enabling the 
whole system benefits all the 
components. Our network is 
the foundation of our business 
and how we operate. It’s what 
allows us to make inclusive 
growth a reality — because we’re 
activating our network to enable 
the digital economy to work for 
everyone, everywhere. And we’re 
doing it in ways that consider our 
workforce, the environment and the ethical standards to which 
we hold ourselves accountable — 
because the ways and means 
matter, too.
 As the digital economy 
increasingly becomes the 
economy, it is both our business 
strategy and our social 
responsibility to ensure that 
people and organizations have 
access to the networks, tools 
and solutions that can help them 
reach their potential and achieve 
financial security. That means 
approaching everything through 
the lens of our culture of decency 
and using our technology and 
experience to empower each 
individual — no matter where 
they come from — as well as the 
system as a whole.
 Our work is as much about 
connecting farmers in developing 
regions to a digital marketplace 
as it is about working with a 
range of public and private 
partners to build the inclusive, 
accessible and sustainable  cities of the future. And it is  
as much about inspiring the  
best and brightest talent to  
drive our company’s innovation 
as it is about infusing them  
with the ethics that guide the 
way we manage the business, 
treat customers and contribute 
to society.
 All that is just a taste of 
what we’re delivering on today. 
Our purpose drives us forward. 
Our sense of Mastercard as a 
member of society, with the 
responsibility to benefit people 
and partners, shareholders and 
customers alike, compels us to 
make more connections, further 
amplifying the network effect. 
We’re working to scale “Doing 
Well by Doing Good” by making 
commercially sustainable social 
impact the new paradigm for 
business as usual, because we 
believe being purpose-driven is 
fundamental to sustainability — 
for everyone. 
Ajay Banga,  
president and CEO,  
Mastercard“ It’s time for ‘doing 
well by doing good’ 
to become business 
as usual.“
2Mastercard is proud to contribute to a sustainable and inclusive future.  
Below are highlights from our 2018 annual corporate sustainability report:
We are dedicated to building an inclusive world 
in which the digital economy works for everyone, 
everywhere. By creating scalable solutions for 
sustainable and inclusive economic growth,  
we can build pathways to a more secure  
future for everyone.
• Together with our partners, we have  
reached more than 400 million people 
previously excluded from financial services 
toward the goal of providing access to 500 
million by 2020.
• Mastercard pledged $500 million for 
inclusive growth and established the 
Mastercard Impact Fund. To date, the  
Fund has committed more than $40 million 
in grants.

for Social Impact collaborative with the 
Rockefeller Foundation, which will increase 
the capacity of social sector organizations 
and government to solve systemic problems.INCLUSIVE 
GROWTH
Our success is tied in part to the trust that people 
place in us to deliver our products and services 
in the right way. For us, acting ethically and 
responsibly is not only the right thing to do, but 
also the right way to do business.
• Our enterprise-wide Code of Conduct guides 
our Ethics and Compliance system and sits 
at the foundation of our culture of decency. 
It shapes how we manage our business, treat 
our customers and contribute to society.
• We continued our compliance efforts to the 
European GDPR by appointing a Europe-based 
Data Protection Officer to oversee our ongoing 
compliance with the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) and by our launch of 
Trūata, an independent data trust working 
to anonymize data and continue providing 
analytic services in a GDPR-compliant manner.  
We expanded our commitment to ethical 
data practices by making the core consumer 
protections of the EU-GDPR available to 
individuals in other jurisdictions by the end of 
the first quarter of 2020. 
• We continued to leverage our innovation 
expertise in developing the next generation 
of technologies to make payments faster, 
more convenient and more secure.ETHICAL AND 
RESPONSIBLE 
STANDARDS
The success of our business is inextricably tied 
to our people. Mastercard relies on our global 
workforce to help us achieve our goal of building 
a sustainable, inclusive global economy, and we 
work to make our company the place where the 
best people choose to be.
• We continued our progress toward gender 
equity and equal pay for equal work, with 
our female employees earning $0.996 for 
every $1.000 earned by men.
• In addition to expanding our generous 
employer contributions to employee 
retirement plans, we strengthened  
our employee health and well-being 
programs to further support employees 
in their physical, emotional and financial 
well-being.
• Our employees supported more than 
2,200 charities through monetary 
donations or by contributing nearly  
70,000 volunteer hours, including 
through more than 75 events at which 
our employees served as educators, role 
models and mentors for our signature 
Girls4Tech STEM education program.INSPIRED 
WORKFORCE
At Mastercard, we have set ambitious goals and are 
taking action across our company and supply chain 
to continuously improve the environmental footprint 
of our offices and operations. We also take 
advantage of opportunities to apply our people, 
assets and innovation to contribute environmentally 
conscious solutions for a more sustainable future.

our science-based target to reduce our 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 20% by 
2025, from a 2016 baseline.
• We source renewable energy for 100% of our 
global operations, and we are committed to 
maintaining this goal on an ongoing basis, 
even as our energy footprint expands.

solutions and cross-sector partnerships, such 
as the Greener Payments Partnership and 
the UN Global Compact Cities Programme, to 
help consumers, businesses and cities lessen 
their impact on the planet.

for urban collaboration that brings cities, 
companies and communities together to 
identify common challenges and create 
solutions that can be scaled up broadly.ENVIRONMENTAL

6Our core network supports 
what is often referred to as 
a “four-party” payments 
network. Through our core global 
payments processing network, 
we facilitate the switching 
(authorization, clearing and 
settlement) of payment 
transactions and deliver related 
products and services.
 With additional payment 
capabilities that include real-
time account-based payments, 
including automated clearing

PAYMENTS NETWORK*Our core business
 We operate in a dynamic 
and rapidly evolving legal and 
regulatory environment, with 
heightened regulatory and 
legislative scrutiny, expansion of 
local regulatory schemes and other 
legal challenges, particularly with 
respect to interchange fees. These 
challenges create both risks and 
opportunities for our industry, as 
detailed in our annual report.

Holder MerchantMastercard does not issue cards 
or other payment devices, extend 
credit to account holders or 
determine the interest rates or other

Each issuer determines these and 
most other competitive payment 
program features. In addition, we 
do not establish the discount rate 
that merchants are charged for 
acceptance, which is the responsibility 
of our acquiring customers.
 We generate revenues from:
• Assessing our customers based on 
the gross dollar volume (“GDV”) of 
activity on the products that carry 
our brands
• The fees we charge to our customers 
for providing transaction-processing

and merchants. We also offer products 
that make it easier for merchants to 
accept payments and expand their

biometrics and machine-learning 
technologies in our push to secure  
every transaction. These efforts  
include driving EMV-level security  
and benefits through all our  
payment channels.

Development
At Labs, the Research and 
Development team works with 
cutting-edge technologies, 
including blockchain, mixed 
reality and artificial intelligence, 
to explore the market value of 
new solutions. Headquartered 
in Dublin, we bring a truly global 
focus, with team members from 
Singapore to Pune, Nairobi, New 
York and San Francisco. 
 Our deeply skilled technical 
team utilizes lean startup 
principles and agile engineering 
to validate whether we have a 
robust solution to an existing 
problem or a still-unmet need. 
We then test for the solution‘s 
desirability, product-market fit 
and viability. From there, we look 
for commercial opportunities 
and build the framework through 
transition to full-scale launch.  
Our team experiments and 
iterates continuously to help 
Mastercard and our partners 
unlock the commercial potential  
of emerging technologies.Innovation at Mastercard is more 
than the work of Labs. Every 
aspect of our organization — 
from accounting to engineerin g— 
needs to think and operate 
differently to help Mastercard 
instill an execution mindset 
across the enterprise. We are 
building the foundation to foster 
internal innovators to develop 
execution skills by implementing 
tools such as design thinking.  
 We launched Innovation 
Week, a five-day global program 
sponsored by senior executives 
that featured nearly 200 events. 
More than 260 ideas were 
generated by Take Initiative, our 
global hackathon that brings 
together cross-functional teams. 
As we look to the future, our 
Innovation Management team 
is developing accelerated work 
sessions (focused on ideation and 
commercialization and innovation-
as-a-service) to improve the 
execution and delivery of new 
products and services.Innovation 
ManagementOur Labs as a Service team 
works externally with customers 
to transform their businesses. 
Since 2015, we have executed 
on nearly 300 engagements 
around the world with clients 
in the airline, banking and retail 
industries, among others. Our 
flagship service is Launchpad,  
a rapid prototyping, rapid-

during which our innovation

well as software engineer s— 
work side-by-side with our 
clients’ product teams to ideate

 With our co-creation

help clients reduce product 
development cycles and compress 
months of work into shorter time 
periods. We partnered with a 
global bank looking to elevate its 
payments capabilities. We helped 
it bring a wearable payment 
product to market in fewer than 
10 months. By combining our 
global expertise with startup 
agility, we deliver lasting benefits 
in our pursuit of groundbreaking

12Our deep connection to startups leads 
to new insights beyond payment s. 
Start Path  is our award-winning 
program that provides support to 
innovative, later-stage startups. We 
provide operational scale support 
and connect these companies to our 
own Mastercard executives, as well 
as to leaders from partner financial 
institutions, the tech industry and 
global retailers, to create the future  
of commerce together.
 The Start Path team vetted more 
than 1,400 applicants in 2018 and 
has partnered with more than 200 
global startups over the past five years 
in areas as diverse as digital identity, 
health care, security and more. For 
example, Mastercard is working with 
MAX, a Nigeria-based motorcycle-share 
company, to provide digital payment 
capabilities and installments for typically 
unbanked riders, enabling riders to 
purchase motorcycles over time and,  
as a result, build their credit profiles. 
 Collectively, the startups in the 
program have raised more than  
$1.3 billion in capital investment.With 1.7 billion adults lacking access 
to basic financial tools and services, 
there is a critical need to develop 
products and services that can help 
people in underserved communities 
thrive. The Nairobi-based Mastercard 
Lab for Financial Inclusion  has 
created groundbreaking solutions to 
help individuals better manage risk, 
financially plan for the future and  
lead empowered lives.
 The Lab focused on scaling its 
solutions across multiple markets. The 
award-winning Mastercard Farmer 
Network , which digitizes marketplaces, 
payments and transactions for farmers, 
was launched in India in partnership with 
the Government of Andhra Pradesh. 
Kupaa, an education payments platform 
developed with UNICEF, was adopted 
by more than 300 schools in Uganda. 
And following a successful pilot in East 
Africa, Kionect, a multi-sided supply chain 
platform that enables the growth of 
unbanked small merchants by efficiently 
linking them to financial service providers, 
is poised to scale in Egypt. 
 With the support of the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation to support 
these projects, the Lab brings together 
Mastercard's innovation and global 
financial inclusion capabilities under one 
roof, combining these with local expertise 
and insight to empower the underserved.Start PathLab for  
Financial Inclusion
The world is more connected 
than ever, and cross-border 
trade in goods and services 
has grown with technological 
innovation and the globalization 
of commerce.  
 As a result, companies are 
managing complex supply chains 
and an ever-growing number of 
moving parts — raw materials, 
operational processes, finished 
products and suppliers. At the 
same time, consumers and 
companies alike are increasingly 
interested in how sustainably and 
equitably goods are produced and 
delivered from the factory to the 
point of sale.
 Mastercard’s Provenance 
solution addresses this growing 
demand by providing the tools 
to trace a product’s provenance, 
from origin to end consumer. Using 
our extensive capabilities with 
blockchain technologies, artificial 
intelligence, fraud solutions, brand-
protection programs and our 
global networks, we have built a 
scalable, flexible solution to help 
companies achieve transparency 
with their partners while also 
stopping counterfeit trade, 
complying with regulations and 
supporting greater sustainability.Provenance
Mastercard Tech Hubs are 
specialized workplaces 
designed to create a culture of 
collaboration and innovation.  
 These offices in our key 
markets around the world are 
staffed with cross-functional 
innovation teams working in

St. Louis, New York, Dublin,  
Pune and Sydney — are home  
to a diverse mix of local,  
regional and global teams 
working autonomously and  
in global alignment to achieve 
our commitment to operate  
and deliver “Faster, Better  
and Smarter.” Our Dublin Tech Hub became 
home to an AI practice built 
by Mastercard Labs. The AI 
practice is focused on leveraging 
the power of machine learning, 
predictive analytics and other 
advanced technologies to

 Our Sydney Tech Hub 
opened in a world-class facility 
that closes the gap among 
employees and customers,

with Transport for New South 
Wales to bring contactless 
ticketing to Sydney Ferries 
and Light Rail, which will allow 
commuters, for the first time 
in Australia, to purchase transit 
fares via their Mastercard

13SUSTAINABILITY AT MASTERCARD
This understanding is foundational 
to our approach to sustainability: 
doing well by doing good. We 
recognize that Mastercard cannot 
succeed in a failing world. We 
thrive when economies thrive, 
and a successful economy is 
sustainable only when it is 
inclusive and when prosperity  
is shared. 
 We envision — and we are 
working toward — a world in which 
people are on a path of shared 
prosperity. The more people join 
the formal economy and begin to 
earn, spend and save, the greater 
our collective economic growth, and the more the benefits of that 
growth are widely shared. Doing 
well by doing good means greater 
opportunities for individuals 
and businesses of all sizes, while 
also creating stronger financial 
institutions and more effective 
governments.
 To achieve this vision, we must 
examine our technology, our 
products and our business models 
to determine how they can best 
be applied to improve our social 
impact. And if we are to make 
that social impact scalable and 
sustainable, we must be able to 
see the commercial benefit of As a global company that serves 
customers in more than 210 countries 
and territories, we understand how 
interconnected the world is, and we 
see firsthand how our commitment to 
environmental and social responsibility — 
and our core value of operating ethically 
and responsibly — is directly connected  
to our continuing success as a business.our investments in this area. That is the 
root of doing well by doing good — an 
approach to sustainability that supports 
Mastercard’s business vision and aligns 
with our strategy. 
• Our vision:  A World Beyond Cash®
• Our mission:  Every day, everywhere, 
we use our technology and expertise 
to make payments safe, simple  
and smart.
• Our commitment: We’re committed 
to being a force for good in the world 
and to doing well by doing good. As a 
core component of our strategy, we’re 
conducting business in an open and 
transparent way, advancing inclusive 
growth, building an inspired workforce 
and being good stewards of the 
environment to create a sustainable 
future for Mastercard and the world 
around us.
A SUCCESSFUL 
ECONOMY IS 
SUSTAINABLE 
ONLY WHEN IT IS 
INCLUSIVE AND 
WHEN PROSPERITY  
IS SHARED
14To help determine the priority 
areas for Mastercard’s 
sustainability work, in 2016 we 
conducted a materiality analysis 
in partnership with Business 
for Social Responsibility (BSR), 
a global nonprofit business 
network and consultancy 
dedicated to sustainability. We 
prioritized topics across two 
dimensions: their influence on 
our business success and their 
importance to our external 
stakeholders. We also conducted 
a current-state assessment that 
helps us understand how we are 
managing our priorities.
 Informed by this assessment, as 
well as by our ongoing engagement  
with stakeholders, we focus on 
four priority areas, each of which 
includes several topics:Inclusive Growth
We combine expertise, data, 
technology and philanthropic 
investments to empower 
those working on the front 
lines of inclusive growth. We 
bring together businesses, 
governments, academic 
institutions and nongovernmental 
organizations to create new 
models of collaboration that 
ignite inclusive growth.
Inspired Workforce
At Mastercard, our industry 
expertise is enhanced by the 
diverse insights of our global 
workforce. Our dedication to 
cultivating an environment for 
all employees that respects their 
individual strengths, views and 
experiences drives a global and 
collaborative culture of inclusion.Materiality and  
our focus areasEnvironmental Stewardship
We understand the importance 
of addressing environmental 
sustainability and have undertaken 
a variety of initiatives regarding 
greenhouse gas emissions, real 
estate, energy, landfill diversion  
and transportation, as well as 
products and services.
Ethical and Responsible 
Standards 
Ethics and compliance are embedded 
in our core values, and we take a 
proactive approach to conducting 
business in a trusted and transparent 
way. Mastercard fosters sound 
governance through an independent 
board structure and robust risk and 
compliance programs.
Mastercard believes it is good 
practice to internally review  
our material issues each year, 
as we have this year with our 
partner BSR.
 In addition, every few years we 
plan to conduct a more formal 
materiality refresh that will 
involve a variety of external  
and internal stakeholders.

Stakeholders
17Our business goals and the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) are inextricably linked.
 Our technology, expertise 
and approach to partnership are 
helping drive implementation and 
scale for the global goals, while 
advancing our mission to create 
a more inclusive economy. In 
active support of these goals, we 
have programs in more than 60 
countries designed to reach the 
financially excluded.Supporting the  
UN Sustainable  
Development GoalsMastercard is most closely 
addressing these goals: 
1. Zero Hunger (Goal 2), Good 
Health and Well-Being (Goal 3) 
and Quality Education (Goal 4): 
Mastercard and the World Food 
Programme are working together 
to reverse the cycle of hunger 
and poverty. We are connecting 
Mastercard’s partnership network 
and digital innovation with the 
World Food Programme’s work 
in providing vital food assistance 
and resilience-building programs 
to vulnerable communities. We 
contributed 33 million meals 
as part of our commitment to 
provide 100 million meals in total 
through partnerships with NGOs 
and our customers around the 
world that raise visibility for the 
cause and incentivize donations. 
Our partnerships have enabled 
us to further support health and 
education improvement initiatives 
globally. (Read more on page 37 .)
2. Gender Equality (Goal 5): 
Mastercard’s signature STEM 
education platform, Girls4Tech, 
was created to inspire girls 
to pursue STEM careers and 
help narrow the gender gap 
in technology fields. Since the 
program launched in 2014, we 
have reached more than 400,000 
girls and are well on our way to 
achieving our goal of reaching 
more than 1 million by 2025. 
(Read more on pages 33  and 54 .)3. Decent Work and  
Economic Growth (Goal 8):  
One way we are lifting individuals 
out of poverty and supporting 
the overall economic growth of 
local communities is through the 
Mastercard Farmer Network. 
This mobile platform digitizes 
agriculture marketplaces, 
payments and workflows, 
providing farmers an easy and 
secure way to buy, sell and 
receive payments for agricultural 
products through their feature 
phones. (Read more on page 30 .)
4. Sustainable Cities and 
Communities (Goal 11):  
Through City Possible, a new 
public-private partnership 
model powered by Mastercard, 
participating cities can access 
a network to identify shared 
challenges and seek sustainable 
business models to address 
them. City Possible provides a 
framework to co-create, pilot and 
scale solutions, connecting cities 
with private-sector players that 
are equally committed to people-
centered design. (Read more on 
page 74 .)5. Partnerships for the Goals 
(Goal 17): 
In partnership with Unilever, 
Mastercard is unlocking growth 
for micro-merchants through 
an innovative digital supply 
chain platform. Our Jaza Duka 
system (Swahili for “fill up your 
store”) helps shopkeepers use 
their purchasing history — rather 
than the formal credit history or 
collateral that lenders normally 
require — to access microcredit. 
This frees them to buy and sell 
more goods, opens doors to other 
financial service products in the 
future and helps entrepreneurs 
avoid needing to borrow from 
informal lenders at high interest 
rates, which can trap them in a 
cycle of debt. Jaza Duka is one 
example of how Mastercard 
is developing new models of 
partnership for commercially 
sustainable social impact.  
(Read more on page 31 .)Core to our business objectives, 
as well as our sustainability 
initiatives, is our work to 
connect the underbanked and 
unbanked to formal financial 
services as a way of driving 
shared economic growth. 
 Mastercard is involved in a 
number of partnership efforts 
that approach financial inclusion 
through financial innovation, 
policymaker and key-stakeholder 
engagement, financial education, 
philanthropy and academic 
research. Our partnerships include :
• Alliance for Financial Inclusion
• Better Than Cash Alliance
• CEO Partnership for

focuses on our efforts in four key 
areas as noted in the highlights 
and presented in greater detail 
throughout the report .
• Inclusive Growth
• Inspired Workforce
• Environmental Stewardship
• Ethical and

 In selecting content for inclusion in 
our 2018 report, we used the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI)’s reporting 
principles of materiality, sustainability 
context and stakeholder inclusiveness 
and completeness, as well as the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals. This 
report was prepared in accordance 
with the GRI Standards: Core option.
 An index of the relevant GRI 
disclosures can be found on page 94 .Report scopeABOUT THIS REPORT
This report covers the 2018 fiscal year, spanning Jan. 1 
to Dec. 31, 2018. In some cases, we include data and 
information about programs and activities relevant to  
our corporate sustainability priority areas that occurred  
in the 2019 fiscal year, as noted.
Mastercard published its first 
corporate sustainability report 
in 2018, documenting the 2017 
fiscal year and presenting 
highlights from our long-
standing sustainability efforts. 
Previously, Mastercard had 
reported on our commitment 
and approach to sustainability 
via our website, our annual proxy 
disclosure, Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP) and other sources.
 As we continue our journey of 
innovation, transformation and 
leadership, we regularly review 
our strategy and approach to 
corporate sustainability. This 
ongoing analysis helps us to 
identify and prioritize the issues 
relevant to our business and our 
stakeholders. Our materiality 
analysis with BSR and the priority 
areas identified in that process 
were incorporated in the approach 
and content of this report.Reporting history  
and frequency
Mastercard did not employ an 
external agency or organization  
to audit the contents of this 
report. However, certain 
elements of our external 
disclosures have gone through 
external independent assurance. 
 This includes calculations 
of our greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and reduction targets.

19 02INCLUSIVE  
GROWTH
20At Mastercard, we envision a world in 
which economic growth is inclusive and 
sustainable and the digital economy  
works for everyone, everywhere. As the 
global economy increasingly goes digital, all 
people should have access to the tools and 
the networks that are key to their prosperity.OUR APPROACH
2121We pulled together a number 
of different efforts across the 
organization to form Mastercard 
Strategic Growth, which spans 
from the purely commercial to 
the fully philanthropic, to further 
our commitment to pursue 
commercially sustainable  
social impact.
 To achieve the most impact, 
we embarked on an initiative 
to refine our inclusive growth 
strategy. The Mastercard Center 
for Inclusive Growth led the process, 
engaging leaders from government, 
nongovernmental organizations, 
philanthropy, academia, civil society 
and business to examine how such 
issues as digitization, economic 
growth, income inequality, changing 
demographics, urban migration and 
the changing nature of work create 
challenges and opportunities for 
inclusive growth.We used our refined strategy to 
guide our ongoing investments in 
inclusive growth. The pages that 
follow highlight our progress. 
 Looking ahead, we also see 
the urgency in mobilizing other 
purpose-driven companies 
to achieve our shared vision. 
Through partnerships with  
others in business, we can  
apply our collective resources  
and move at speed and scale  
to create additional pathways  
for inclusive growth.  The process revealed four key 
pillars where Mastercard could 
have the greatest impact:
1. Moving individuals toward 
greater financial security,  
building on our long-standing 
financial inclusion efforts, to ensure 
that all people have access to the 
tools and resources they need to 
thrive in the digital economy.
2. Improving how communities 
drive economic development  by 
harnessing our technology and 
data science expertise to help 
attract investments that can 
have the most significant positive 
impact on communities, helping 
ensure that growth is inclusive.
3. Helping people navigate 
today’s rapidly changing 
economy  so that, as the nature 
of work changes, all people have 
access to tools that facilitate their 
transition among places, positions 
and careers.
4. Leveraging the power of data 
science for good by increasing 
the capacity of social sector 
organizations and government  
to solve systemic problems with 
data tools and insights.Mastercard joined the newly 
created CEO Partnership for 
Economic Inclusion, which is  
led by the UN Secretary-
General’s Special Advocate 
for Inclusive Finance for 
Development, Queen Máxima  
of the Netherlands.
 Through this collaboration, 
10 multinational companies 
are partnering to expand and 
accelerate financial inclusion 
initiatives for underserved 
people in rapidly emerging 
economies. We are excited about 
the opportunities to advance 
economic inclusion through this 
partnership, which includes 
Mastercard’s work with Unilever.

23Several institutions underpin  
our inclusive growth strategy  
and impact.
Mastercard Center  
for Inclusive Growth  
Established in 2013, the Center 
leverages the company’s data, 
technology and expertise to catalyze 
action on inclusive growth through 
research, programs, data philanthropy 
and engagement. To date, the Center 
has collaborated with more than 50 
research organizations and fellows and 
invested in programs reaching more 
than 575,000 people in 17 countries. 
The Center’s ongoing initiatives are 
focused on furthering the financial 
inclusion and security of individuals, 
connecting small and micro-businesses 
with the tools and resources they 
need to grow, equipping policymakers 
and community leaders with data-
driven insights to inform economic 
development, and accelerating the 
use of data science in the nonprofit 
and public sectors. The Center has 
led the practice of responsible data 
philanthropy, working with partners 
and scholars to develop insights 
that support smart policy and NGO 
strategies to advance social impact.Mastercard Lab  
for Financial Inclusion 
Created in 2014 and located in 
Nairobi, the Lab seeks to create 
groundbreaking solutions to help 
individuals and micro-merchants 
benefit from the digital economy. 
Current projects include the 
Mastercard Farmer Network (read 
more on page 30 ), Kupaa (more 
on page 29 ) and Kionect (more on 
page 28 ), which facilitate digital 
payments and other solutions 
that respectively support farmers, 
parents of schoolchildren and 
small-scale merchants. With 
the support of the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation to 
support these projects, the Lab 
brings together Mastercard’s 
innovation and global financial 
inclusion capabilities under one 
roof, combining these with local 
expertise and insight to empower 
the underserved.  
Mastercard Impact Fund 
In part due to the benefits of U.S. 
tax reform, Mastercard pledged 
$500 million for inclusive growth 
and established the Mastercard 
Impact Fund. To date, the Fund, 
which is administered by the 
Mastercard Center for Inclusive 
Growth, has committed more 
than $40 million in grants.Our inclusive growth initiatives
Our New Mastercard 
Impact Fund
We created the Mastercard Impact 
Fund to promote long-term inclusive 
economic growth around the world.
 Highlights of Fund grants 
committed to date include:
DataKind: The Fund will support 
DataKind’s efforts to enhance the 
use of data science and artificial 
intelligence by nonprofit organizations 
and governments for social impact. 
(This grant is part of the Mastercard 
Center for Inclusive Growth’s new 
partnership with the Rockefeller 
Foundation, which is described in 
more detail on page 34. )
Accion: The Fund will help Accion 
digitize and modernize financial 
service providers serving small and 
micro-businesses. This initiative is 
intended to help up to 10 million 
people scale their businesses.
Business for Social Responsibility 
(BSR): The Fund will help BSR 
expand financial inclusion and security 
for workers in garment supply chains, 
especially women. BSR’s efforts 
include supporting the transition

women’s economic empowerment 
in seven countries, starting with 
Bangladesh, Cambodia and Egypt.
24Key 2018 accomplishments include:
• The launch of the Young Africa 
Works strategy to enable 30 
million young people, especially 
young women, to secure 
dignified and fulfilling work  
by 2030.
• The opening of an office in Kigali, 
Rwanda, and the co-creation 
of two initiatives with the 
Rwandan government: Hanga 
Ahazaza (“create the future” in 
Kinyarwanda), which will increase 
employment opportunities for 
young people in the tourism and 
hospitality industry, and Leaders 
in Teaching, which is to develop 
passionate, skilled teachers and 
prepare them to deliver high-
quality secondary education.Mastercard  
Foundation  
highlights
 To date, the Mastercard 
Foundation Scholars Program, 
an education- and leadership-
development program supporting 
Africa’s next generation of 
leaders, has committed 35,000 
scholarships. The program enables 
students whose talent and 
promise exceed their financial 
resources to complete their 
education at universities in Africa, 
Europe, North and South America, 
and the Middle East. The majority 
of the scholars are young women.Mastercard Foundation 
Created in 2006, at the time 
of Mastercard’s initial public 
offering, when the company 
gifted 10 percent of its shares to 
pioneer an independent model for 
philanthropy. Its assets have grown 
to exceed $30 billion, making it one 
of the world’s largest foundations. 
In 2018, the Foundation received 
$112 million in stock dividends 
from Mastercard to support 
its ongoing efforts. To date, 
the Foundation has committed 
$2.2 billion to programs that are 
improving the lives of 33 million 
people1 living in poverty. Today,  
it works in 29 African countries, 
with 118 active partners.
1  Direct outreach is defined as the number 
of beneficiaries directly reached through 
the Mastercard Foundation’s program 
activities. The variety of methodology and 
measurement tools used to calculate direct 
outreach reflects the different types of 
programming interventions undertaken 
by the Foundation. Its programming areas 
include education and learning, youth 
livelihood and financial inclusion, with direct 
outreach in each of these programming 
areas respectively totaling 124,000 people, 
3 million people and 30 million people. Since 
the Foundation’s inception, an aggregate 
33.1 million beneficiaries were directly 
reached.
25We are dedicated to increasing 
the opportunity for individuals 
and small and micro-merchants 
to achieve financial security and 
greater prosperity. Since 2011, the 
number of adults excluded from the 
financial system has dropped by 
nearly a third, to 1.7 billion. Financial inclusion goals and performance 
Together with our partners, we have 
reached  more than 400 million people 
previously excluded from financial 
services toward the goal of providing 
access to 500 million by 2020.“ Over the next decade, 
how can Mastercard 
be an even greater 
force for good than we 
are now? How can we 
play a role in rebuilding 
trust in corporations 
and other institutions? 
How can we put even 
more of the talent 
and treasure of this 
company to work in not 
only building profits, but 
building a better world?"

 president and CEO, Mastercard

using our products, 
technology, expertise 
and understanding of 
ecosystems to ensure 
that the digital

customers, technology and 
telecommunications companies,

organizations to create solutions

merchants run their businesses 
more efficiently, helping small- 
enterprise owners gain access to

manage critical social services.SOLUTIONS  
FOR INCLUSION
When it comes to 
inclusion, there is a 
need for solutions 
that bring together 
innovative technology, 
business models and 
ecosystems.
27Around the world, micro-, 
small and medium-size 
enterprises account for 90%2  
of all businesses, including 
approximately 162 million 
businesses in emerging markets.3 
These businesses are key drivers 
of economic growth, yet many 
are stuck in the cash economy, 
making it difficult for business 
owners to access credit and  
grow their businesses.  Kionect:  
a technology 
platform to help 
micro-merchants 
grow their 
businesses In emerging markets, many 
micro-merchants — small-
scale traders with kiosks — rely 
on informal business systems, 
typically buying wares from 
wholesalers with cash and 
receiving cash payments from 
customers. This reliance on cash 
limits their ability to grow and 
build the credit history needed to 
access formal financial products. 
 This cash-based system  
also makes it more challenging 
to capture data of quality. Data 
on consumer demand and 
purchases can improve decision-
making and efficiency, and can 
help financial institutions create 
and tailor products and services 
that help micro-merchants grow 
their businesses. Data also allow 
consumer goods companies to offer 
incentives and rewards targeted 
directly to micro-merchants.

MORE EFFECTIVELY
 The Mastercard Lab for 
Financial Inclusion created the 
supply chain platform Kionect 
to connect micro-merchants, 
suppliers and financial institutions. 
Kionect offers financial institutions  
better data to extend credit to 
micro-merchants, who use that 
credit to buy more stock from 
their suppliers, better serve 
their customers and grow their 
businesses. We enhanced Kionect 
to become a functional working-
capital credit platform to be  
rolled out in several markets in  
the coming years.
28Mastercard Lab for Financial 
Inclusion launched Kupaa, a 
digital platform that helps 
families in Uganda make 
school payments. Kupaa is 
implemented in partnership 
with the Ugandan Ministry of 
Education and Sports, UNICEF 
Uganda and Yo Uganda.
 Kupaa (which, in Swahili, means 
“to fly high”) reduces inefficiencies 
and increases the security of 
school payments by digitizing 
payments and information flow 
between schools and parents 
and by enabling access to such 
education-related products 
as loans for school fees and 
insurance. To register, students 
and parents are given a unique 
identifier that Kupaa uses to track 
payments and other student-
related actions.Kupaa: digitizing 
school payments 
in Uganda
 The platform delivers benefits  
to parents, schools and the 
government. Parents are able to 
receive Kupaa updates by SMS, 
while schools access the system 
via an app. The platform also  
has a government dashboard  
for a ministry of education to 
track teacher attendance, see 
grants and view aggregated 
student enrollment data to

Quick Response (QR) payment 
technology .
 Our PayGo  API solution 
combines low-cost QR technology 
— an open and interoperable 
technology — with the “internet of

to make secure, efficient 
payments from their mobile 
phones to access necessities like 
clean energy and water, while 
building a credit record. (Read

who’s involved and how they benefit
The Mastercard Lab for 
Financial Inclusion created the 
Mastercard Farmer Network 
to provide smallholder farmers 
with a simple digital platform 
to gain access to agriculture 
markets and formal financial 
services, including payments 
and financial histories. Not 
only does this help smallholder 
farmers and their families 
fulfill their aspirations, the 
Mastercard Farmer Network 
facilitates greater efficiency in 
the agriculture value chain.
 We launched Mastercard 
Farmer Network with the 
International Center for Tropical 
Agriculture (CIAT) in Uganda, 
the Government of Andhra 
Pradesh in India and the National 
Microfinance Bank (NMB) in 
Tanzania. To date, more than 
275,000 farmers have been 
registered on the Mastercard 
Farmer Network.Mastercard

3030The digital payment system 
reduces cash leakage, improves 
the transparency of payment 
flows and allows farmers to 
earn up to 10% more for their 
product. We also brought on a 
local payment facilitator, Qiubo, 
to offer micro-merchants a way 
to accept digital payments and 
offer services such as cashback, 
bill payments and mobile phone 
top-ups in the places the coffee 
growers live and work. 
 As part of this partnership, 
the Mastercard Center for 
Inclusive Growth is also 
supporting the farmers with 
financial-literacy training. With 
our support, Fundaci ón Capital 
is giving farmers the financial 
tools and education they 
need to use digital financial 
products and develop new 
behaviors that will help them 
achieve financial security. Our 
goal is to replicate and scale 
the approach in other regions.We announced our global 
partnership with the Neumann 
Kaffee Gruppe, one of the 
world’s largest coffee trading 
groups, to digitize payments 
and enhance financial inclusion  
and transparency in the 
company’s supply chain. 
Together, we aim to position 
coffee production as a main 
driver of an inclusive economy, 
creating a source of long-
term income for growers and 
securing a sustainable supply 
of coffee for the company.  
 Many farmers rely on cash 
systems, which creates risks 
of loss or theft and reduces 
farmer access to better pricing, 
as well as to financial products 
and services that could help 
them weather tough times and 
build their businesses.
 We collaborated with 
Neumann Kaffee Gruppe’s 
Mexican subsidiary, Exportadora 
de Café California (ECC) on a 
pilot program called Café Paga, 
which gave an initial pilot of  
150 farmers in Chiapas access 
to a safe, secure account. Digitizing 
payments for 
smallholder 
farmers 
In Kenya in 2017, we began 
a partnership with Unilever 
and KCB Bank to provide low-
interest credit to shopkeepers 
and to digitize Unilever’s supply 
chain. Jaza Duka (“fill up your 
store” in Swahili), the program 
prototype for our Kionect 
development, helps KCB Bank 
assess credit risk and provide 
shopkeepers with digital credit 
and accounts, which run on 
the Mastercard network. It 
also helps Unilever expand 
its distribution. Since launch, 
more than 15,000 shopkeepers 
have registered to buy their 
products through the program.Jaza Duka: 
financing for 
small businesses 
in Kenya A key element of the program 
is equipping merchants with 
basic financial knowledge, 
including the importance of using 
their credit responsibly. With this 
in mind, the Mastercard Center 
for Inclusive Growth partnered 
with the nonprofit TechnoServe, 
which gives micro-merchants 
in-person training on topics 
such as financial and credit 
management, merchandising 
and other business operational 
skills. In 2017 and 2018, this 
training reached nearly 5,000 
merchants, more than half of 
them women. As a result of 
the program, shopkeepers who 
were trained have reported an 
average increase in daily revenue 
of nearly 20%.
 To expand the training 
program, we are using digital 
training models, including SMS-
based platforms. Mastercard 
is committed to scaling the 
program with other consumer 
goods companies across several 
emerging markets. This will give 
shopkeepers a wider choice 
among financial propositions, 
training programs and other 
benefits.
31FINANCIAL LITERACY
Education about the 
financial products 
and services and how 
to use them is an 
important component 
of any inclusive growth 
strategy. As a key 
part of our financial 
inclusion efforts, we 
develop, lead and 
sponsor financial 
literacy programs for 
consumers and small- 
business owners.Since Master Your Card  
launched in 2011, Mastercard 
has collaborated with more 
than 120 community partners 
across the United States 
around our shared goal: driving 
understanding of electronic 
payments and financial security 
through access to educational 
programs. We are focused on 
working with people of all ages, 
as well as new business owners, 
to feel empowered to use 
technology to make the most  
of their money.
 Through the support of  
our dedicated Mastercard 
employees, Master Your Card  
has participated in hundreds of 
events to deliver training and 
capacity-building sessions in 
partnership with community 
organizations, local governments 
and other civic groups. In 2018, 
Master Your Card presented 
17 financial literacy workshops 
and training sessions to more 
than 2,500 people in diverse 
communities.For more than 25 years, 
Mastercard Academy has 
educated 30,000 people  
annually about the payments 
industry and technology.
 With more than 600 courses, 
the program strengthens the 
understanding of topics such as 
financial technology, digital 
payments, fraud, risk management 
and regulation for industry 
professions and our stakeholders . 
Courses are offered in local 
languages, and Academy 
attendees can choose from in-
person or online courses, via our 
Academy On The Web platform. 
We also partner with local 
universities and institutions to 
enrich their curriculum and host 
technology conferences featuring 
trainings, hands-on technology 
demonstrations and networking. We also believe that 
partnerships with key national 
stakeholder groups afford us the 
opportunity to educate and align 
on policy issues of importance 
to the various constituency 
groups and customers we serve. 
For example, Mastercard is a 
corporate partner of the National 
Urban League, focusing on 
economic empowerment, equality, 
workforce development, criminal 
justice and education. We work 
collaboratively to address issues of 
importance to urban communities, 
including the future of work, 
financial inclusion, stem education, 
and recruitment and retention.
 By the end of the 2018-19 
school year, we also reached 
more than 30,000 students in 
more than 400 public schools 
through our partnership with the 
leading U.S. education-technology 
company, EVERFI Inc., providing 
financial education to students at 
no cost to schools or taxpayers. 
Through the program, which is 
now in its third year, we have 
been able to teach students 
about money management and 
electronic payments, helping 
set their foundation for a sound 
financial future.Master Your CardMastercard Academy
32Mastercard is helping to narrow 
the gender gap in science, 
technology, engineering and 
math (STEM) education through 
our signature Girls4Tech 
program with a goal of reaching 
more than 1 million by 2025. 
As of the fifth anniversary of 
Girls4Tech in April 2019, the 
program had reached more than 
400,000 girls aged 8 to 12 in 25 
countries, and it has engaged 
more than 3,500 employee 
mentors worldwide. The 
program has been translated 
into 11 languages.
 We built this fun, hands-on, 
inquiry-based curriculum around 
global science and math standards 
to inspire young girls to pursue 
STEM careers. Developed by 
our leading technologists and 
curriculum experts, Girls4Tech 
incorporates Mastercard’s deep 
expertise in payments technology 
and innovation and gives girls a 
window into our work, focused 
on encryption, fraud detection, 
data analysis, network innovation 
and digital convergence.  In 2018, 
Mastercard hosted more than 75 
events at which our employees 
served as educators, role models 
and mentors.Girls4Tech
 To scale the program, we 
have partnered with Scholastic, 
Be Better China, Singapore 
Committee for UN Women 
and the Network for Teaching 
Entrepreneurship (NFTE). As part 
of our partnership with Major 
League Baseball, we created 
Girls4Tech & Sports and hosted 
two events in the District of 
Columbia prior to the MLB All-
Star Game. We also expanded 
the Girls4Tech program into Peru 
and Scotland. We were pleased 
that this program received 
external recognition: Girls4Tech 
won the Global Citizen and Global 
Campaign of the Year from 
PRWeek Global.GIRLS4TECH HAD

33DATA FOR GOOD
Mastercard is working 
with leading scholars 
and institutions to 
conduct research 
and generate data-
driven insights that 
guide evidence-
based solutions and 
policymaking.We also help NGOs, nonprofits, 
city and regional planners, and 
others improve their capacity 
to work with their own data-
related resources. 
 Our Data for Good program 
initiated a number of activities. 
We launched our Data Fellows’ 
program with our first six data 
fellows (read more on page 35 ), 
partnered with three academic 
institutions on research efforts, 
participated in Bloomberg’s 
Data4Good Exchange and 
supported the Stanford PACS 
Digital Impact World Tour.  
Some of this work leverages 
Mastercard data insights, some  
uses third-party data; in some cases, 
we provide capacity-building for an 
organization to extract insights from 
data. In all these cases, Mastercard 
uses robust privacy and data-
protection controls. In January 2019, Mastercard 
and the Rockefeller Foundation 
announced a new collaborative 
philanthropy initiative, Data 
Science for Social Impact, 
dedicated to accelerating the 
use of data science by giving 
nonprofit, civic and government 
organizations the tools, expertise 
and knowledge they need to help 
solve some of the world’s most 
pressing challenges.
 Through this collaborative, 
the Rockefeller Foundation and 
the Mastercard Impact Fund 
have made an initial five-year 
commitment of $50 million, 
which we are hoping to grow 
through participation from other 
companies and philanthropies.Data Science

34Mastercard launched the Data 
Fellows program, a collaboration 
that brought together six 
highly regarded data scientists 
from diverse academic and 
government institutions to spend 
12 months collaborating with 
Mastercard’s data scientists. 
Together, they are studying 
trends and developing insights 
to help policymakers implement 
new programs to improve the 
economic stability of the world’s 
vulnerable communities.
 For example, this program 
supported the research of Data 
Fellow Michelle Thompson, an 
associate professor with the 
University of New Orleans’ 
Department of Planning and 
Urban Studies. Together with 
Mastercard’s Data & Services 
team, the Center for Inclusive The Mastercard 
Center for 
Inclusive Growth’s 
new Data Fellows 
for social goodGrowth teamed up on a 36-hour 
“datathon” to gather insights 
about economic development 
and financial inclusion in New 
Orleans. More than 60 volunteers 
from six offices spent more than 
1,000 hours analyzing anonymized 
Mastercard data, as well as 
publicly available third-party data, 
to develop a holistic picture of 
New Orleans’ economic activity. 
 Thompson is using this 
research to analyze a range 
of economic issues and 
opportunities in New Orleans.

and whether major events such 
as Mardi Gras and popular 
tourist areas such as the French 
Quarter support low-income 
neighborhoods.
 Going forward, we will be 
working with our partners to 
determine how to build actionable 
insights from these findings to 
benefit cities around the country.
35COMMUNITY SUPPORT 
AND DEVELOPMENT
We are committed 
to building solutions 
that channel aid 
quickly and securely 
to those who need 
it. We also support 
communities via 
charitable giving 
to organizations 
working at the 
frontlines to help 
people rebuild their 
lives during and 
after times of crisis.We enable humanitarian 
organizations to more efficiently 
and effectively serve populations 
affected by conflict, displacement 
or natural disaster. Through 
products such as the Mastercard 
Aid Network and initiatives like the 
Smart Communities Coalition, we 
are deploying technology and new 
partnership models to ensure more 
comprehensive responses.
 Since 2015, the Mastercard Aid 
Network and our prepaid and debit 
cards have helped provide lifesaving 
assistance — including essential goods 
such as food, blankets, tarps and 
schoolbooks — to well over 3 million 
people in Greece, Jordan, Kenya, 
Lebanon, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, 
Nigeria, the Philippines, Serbia, Syria 
and Yemen.
 We established the Smart 
Communities Coalition , a public-
private effort co-chaired by 
Mastercard and USAID Power 
Africa to improve energy access and 
connectivity and to increase the 
availability of digital tools in refugee 
settlements and host communities. 
The coalition comprises more than 
35 organizations that facilitate 
innovative, sustainable approaches  
to delivering essential basic services. 
Our goal is to inspire hope and 
economic opportunity for refugees 
and the communities that host them.We take a holistic approach 
to disaster relief by providing 
corporate and employee 
donations for relief agencies. We 
also use our products, services, 
insights and employee volunteer 
support to help relief efforts.
 We committed $720,000 to 
support disaster response efforts 
following hurricanes Michael 
and Florence and the California 
wildfires in the U.S.; earthquakes 
in Lombok and Sulawesi, 
Indonesia; and Typhoon Yutu in  
the Northern Mariana Islands. 
 We also worked with the 
American Red Cross to provide 
efficient aid distribution for 
victims of North Carolina’s 
devastating hurricane and 
flooding. As part of our support, 
we sent a team of employees 
to assist the Red Cross with its 
on-the-ground disaster relief, 
including disaster assessment  
and inventory allocation.Crisis-response

36We fund critical causes and 
community programs through 
Mastercard’s Priceless Causes 
campaigns.  Through these 
campaigns, we work in 
partnership with issuers and 
merchants to make a donation 
to a designated cause every 
time consumers use Mastercard 
products for a certain purchase.
 In addition to these donations, 
we also enable consumers to raise 
funds for meaningful causes by 
leveraging our payment expertise. 
Our Donation Platform, currently 
available in 10 countries, allows 
consumers to sign up to add a 
small donation to their purchases.Funding for 
critical causes
Together with consumers, 
Mastercard has donated more 
than $45 million since 2010 to 
help Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C) 
fund lifesaving cancer research. 
Mastercard has made donations 
on behalf of consumers and has 
run promotions during which 
we match donations consumers 
made through their Mastercards 
to SU2C.
 Through the partnership, we 
engage our issuer and merchant 
partners to promote the program 
through various media channels. 
We also provide our employees 
access to valuable resources from 
the SU2C medical community, 
including information on how 
to receive the latest and most 
promising cancer treatments 
through clinical trials.Stand Up  
to Cancer
We contributed 33 million meals 
as part of our commitment 
to provide 100 million meals 
in total during a two-year 
challenge with the UN World 
Food Programme and local 
nonprofit organizations. We 
funded those meals through 
84 activities and campaigns 
in collaboration with our 
customers to combat extreme 
hunger and poverty. This 
program fed an estimated

41GLOBAL INCLUSION 
AND DIVERSITY
For Mastercard, 
inclusion and diversity 
mean more than 
bringing together 
people from different 
backgrounds. The successes Mastercard 
has achieved in the world are 
made possible by the diverse 
experiences, insights and 
perspectives of our workforce. 
At the core of our strategy is 
recognizing and strengthening 
our diversity. Inclusion is a 
leadership skill that allows 
Mastercard to leverage its 
diverse workforce to deliver our 
innovative products and services. 
 Our emphasis on inclusion 
helps us understand and serve 
an increasingly diverse pool of 
customers and communities. 
Surrounding ourselves with 
talented people from many 
different backgrounds is how we 
limit potential blind spots and 
maintain our ability to prepare 
for future opportunities and 
challenges. Our employees, 
suppliers, customers and 
stakeholders expect Mastercard 
to reflect the diversity of our 
global presence and experience. 
We challenge ourselves to 
provide a workplace where the 
best individuals can thrive and 
apply their authentic selves to 
help our company succeed. To help solidify the importance 
of Global Inclusion and Diversity 
as a business imperative, 
Mastercard launched Regional 
Action Plans across our five 
regions — North America, Europe, 
Middle East and Africa, Latin 
America and the Caribbean, 
and Asia Pacific. Our Chief 
Inclusion Officer met with 
country presidents and senior 
leaders to identify their regional 
priorities and develop plans to 
achieve them. Ideas of inclusion 
and balance in gender and 
ethnic representation appeared 
as high priorities across all 
of our regions; other regions 
also emphasized building local 
leadership skills, ensuring mobility 
of talent across the region and 
more. Developing these regional 
priorities will continue to reinforce 
our reputation as a great place to 
work. We also focused on closing 
the gender gap and increasing 
the female representation within 
our acquired companies, including 
through outreach at Women in 
Tech events and empowering 
their women leaders. This year, we are taking 
our efforts a step further. 
Our new video, “What We’re 
Made Of,”  was developed to 
express our belief that we can 
cultivate a culture of belonging 
by creating connections 
that inspire acceptance — of 
ourselves and of each other. 
The influence of diversity, 
inclusion and belonging leads 
to a winning culture with 
decency at its core. It’s our 
standard at Mastercard, 
because it sparks passion and 
pride to do our best work.THE INFLUENCE

INCLUSION AND 
BELONGING

ITS COREGlobal  
Inclusion Council
We strive to make measurable 
differences every day, and our 
Global Inclusion Council (GIC) 
reflects this. The board of directors 
for our Global Inclusion Office 
helps guide our collective vision 
to ensure we use our actions to 
cultivate a culture of inclusion 
and belonging throughout 
Mastercard. Our GIC brings a 
global perspective, with members 
representing all of our business 
regions — North America, Latin 
America/Caribbean, Europe,  
Asia/Pacific, and Middle East  
and Africa.It is a belief that our differences 
empower us to be a better team — 
one that makes smarter decisions, 
drives innovation and delivers 
stronger business results.
 Everywhere we work, we seek 
to create meaningful connections, 
inspire acceptance and cultivate a 
community where we all belong, 
regardless of — and because of —  
our differences in age, gender, 
ethnicity, experiences, abilities  
and perspectives. 
42Our commitments to 
a culture of inclusion 
and belonging
As we continue our journey of 
inclusion, Mastercard remains 
focused on taking actions that  
make an impact. Among our efforts:
We are committed to gender 
equity and the principle of equal 
pay for equal work.
We are  dedicated to recruiting and 
developing female leaders, and we 
have increased the representation 
of women in our workforce and in 
leadership positions.
We offer our employees 
compensation and benefits  
to support their entire  
experience, both personally  
and professionally .
We work  to provide a safe and 
healthy workplace that enables 
employees to achieve their  
full potential.“ Building diverse 
teams is just one part 
of the equation; we 
also have to create 
an inclusive culture 
where employees, in 
all their diversity, feel 
valued and respected. 
Inclusion is a leadership 
skill that has to be 
developed. When we 
do it right, it’s better 
for business and our 
communities.”

 In addition to employee

maintains a broad portfolio of 
partnerships and organization

to strengthen our connection 
with diverse communities. 
We sponsor approximately 45 
organizations that represent

46All Mastercard employees 
deserve to be treated fairly,  
with respect and dignity, and  
we are committed to supporting 
a diverse and inclusive workforce 
around the globe, free of 
discrimination, harassment  
and retaliation.
 As an equal employment 
opportunity workplace, we 
believe that job qualifications and 
performance should be the sole 
basis for employment decisions 
and opportunities. Every day, we 
work to create a culture that is 
built on decency and that is open, 
diverse and inclusive. We recruit, 
hire, train, pay and promote 
qualified individuals, regardless  
of factors that include:
• age
• alienage or citizenship status
• color, ethnicity, creed or race
• disability
• gender, gender identity or 
gender expression
• genetic information 
• marital or family status 
(including pregnancy,  
childbirth or breastfeeding)
• national origin
• religion
• sexual  orientation 
• veteran status We do not tolerate unlawful 
discrimination, harassment 
or retaliation by employees or 
by our vendors, contractors or 
business partners, including 
sexual harassment, degrading 
or offensive comments or jokes, 
violence, intimidation or threats. 
All Mastercard employees receive 
training on these policies and on 
our expectations. We enforce 
them by providing employees 
with several avenues to report 
concerns, including an anonymous 
Ethics Helpline. We also have 
an Employee Relations function 
that promptly investigates all 
complaints received and takes 
appropriate responsive action 
when warranted, in line with 
consistently applied principles  
of accountability and discipline.

Mastercard’s nine employee 
affinity groups — our Business 
Resource Groups, or BRGs — 
help to advance employees’ 
professional development and 
leadership skills while deepening 
their connection to the 
company’s work.  
 In addition, these BRGs act 
as internal business consultants, 
helping the company with 
consumer research, cultural 
insights, customer segmentation 
and access to networks. While 
each BRG focuses on specific 
areas, they are all guided by our 
culture of inclusion and are open 
to all employees. Across our global 
operations, we have over 100 BRG 
chapters in 35 locations, with more 
than half of our global workforce 
participating in these groups.Business

47One key focus area for  
improving our gender mix 
is recruiting from diverse 
candidate slates for all open 
positions. Every year, Mastercard 
partners with leading business 
organizations, universities and 
events to seek out exceptional 
recruits and encourage them to 
join Mastercard.
 We have formal, targeted 
discussions to address any 
development and succession-
planning gaps by gender at our 
senior management levels. We 
work to ensure we remove any 
barriers that disproportionally 
disadvantage any employee 
segment, including women, 
and afford them the same 
opportunities for career 
advancement.
 We also introduced a global 
female leadership development 
experience called Women Who 
Lead, which focuses on amplifying 
the voices and perspectives of 
the next generation of talented 
women to ensure that they have 
the necessary exposure and 
confidence to take on broader 
roles within the organization.Recruiting

WE EMBRACE 
PRACTICES 
DESIGNED TO 
ENSURE OUR 
WORKFORCE 
RECEIVES 
EQUAL PAY FOR 
EQUAL WORKEquality is one of the foundations 
of our commitment to building 
an inclusive, high-performing 
culture at Mastercard. As we 
advance our efforts, we continue 
to embrace practices designed 
to ensure our workforce receives 
equal pay for equal work.  
 To support this commitment, 
each year we examine our pay 
practices with the support of 
third-party analysis. We review 
and benchmark every role in 
our organization to comparable 
positions in the external market, 
and we assess compensation 
decisions for potential pay 
disparities by gender, among 
other categories. If we uncover 
disparities that are not explained 
in an acceptable manner, we take 
appropriate responsive action to 
correct the situation. Furthermore, 
we offer employees multiple 
channels to raise pay-disparity 
concerns, including our Ethics 
Helpline, our Employee Relations 
team and the Law Department.
 In 2018, our assessment and 
validation process found that, 
globally, women at Mastercard 
earn $0.996 to every $1.000 
earned by men, continuing our 
progress toward full pay equality.Increasing female gender 
representation is a critical 
aspec t of Mastercard’s diversity 
and inclusion agenda. Today, 
women represent 39% of our 
global workforce and 29% of  
our senior leadership.Pay equity

48 We developed our Relaunch 
Your Career (RYC) program to  
help mid-career employees 
returning to the workforce after a 
career break navigate recruitment 
and hiring challenges. By attracting 
mid-level and senior-career 
applicants to Mastercard, RYC 
allows us to tap into and benefit 
from the wealth of experience 
and talent they bring. Candidates 
eligible for RYC have taken a career 
break of two or more years and 
are prepared to return to work 
full-time and re-establish their 
careers. Because of the prevalence 
of women in caregiving roles who 
take such a career pause, we look 
to this program to bolster our 
efforts toward gender balance  
in the workplace. RYC participants — 
“Relaunchers” — engage in a paid, 
16-week program that offers 
training and experience to help 
smooth their path back into the 
workforce. RYC participants are 
paired with a hiring manager that 
provides coaching and regular 
feedback, as well as a mentor 
to assist with networking and 
navigating the workplace. 
 At the end of the program, 
we offer high-performing RYC 
candidates the opportunity to 
take on permanent roles. 
 We continue to grow the 
RYC program: In our 2017 pilot 
year for RYC, we hosted eight 
Relaunchers in two countries. 
In 2018, 31 Relaunchers in nine 
countries participated; at the end 
of that round, 48% of participants 
advanced to full-time positions  
at Mastercard. 
 We are also at work growing a 
diverse pipeline of future leaders. 
Through our Women in Tech 
initiative, Mastercard empowers 
girls and women entering STEM 
fields, identifying promising 
candidates in these career tracks 
and recruiting them to join the 
Mastercard workforce. We’re also 
a proud supporter of Launchcode’s 
CoderGirl program, a weekly 
meet-up that offers aspiring 
female coders mentoring from 
seasoned professionals. Our work on these initiatives 
in recent years has helped 
Mastercard shape our new, 
comprehensive women’s 
empowerment strategy, which 
will launch in 2020. Through 
this strategy, our Executive Vice 
Chairman and Chief Inclusion 
Officer are leading a company-
wide effort to guide our work to 
achieve a world beyond gender 
inequality and exclusion by 
focusing on three strategic pillars– 
people, market and society:
People:  Strive for gender balance 
throughout the company and 
become the “Employer of Choice” 
for talented women around  
the world.
Market: Understand the needs 
of women, who make 80% of 
household buying decisions. Design 
products and services that meet 
their needs, and become the 
“Brand of Choice” for women.
Society: Invest in inclusive growth 
for all the communities we 
serve and become the “Partner 
of Choice” for economically 
empowering women around 
the globe and building a more 
inclusive society.WE CONTINUE

49ATTRACTING AND  
ENGAGING TOP TALENT
In order to remain 
the place where the 
best people choose 
to work, Mastercard 
offers a competitive 
benefits-and-
rewards program 
to attract and 
retain the most 
talented employees 
around the world 
and provide the 
opportunity to bring 
their authentic 
selves to their work.We have designed our Total 
Rewards programs to enrich 
our employees’ experience at 
work and beyond, through a 
mix of fixed and variable pay 
that includes a base salary, 
annual cash incentives and long-
term stock incentives. These 
compensation packages are 
guided by three core principles: 
 
1  Align our long-term interests 
with our stockholders’ interests.
2  Ensure market-competitive pay 
across our packages.
3  Design pay packages that 
encourage optimal short-  
and long-term performance.
Mastercard’s executive 
compensation program is 
designed to support our strategic 
objectives to grow, diversify 
and build our business and to 
attract, motivate and retain our 
executives, who are critical to the 
company’s long-term success. 
(See our 2019 Proxy Statement  
for more details.) In 2018, we 
estimate that our CEO’s annual 
compensation ratio to the median 
annual total compensation for all 
employees was 167-to-1.Compensation 
and rewards
Mastercard has always been 
an active and generous 
contributor to our employees’ 
benefits, including a focus on 
the retirement  readiness of 
our employees. We expanded 
our employer contribution to 
defined contribution retirement 
plans and introduced a minimum 
global standard contribution of 
10% of an employee’s salary 
across all of our markets. 
Introducing this standard will 
increase retirement benefits for 
80% of our employees, including 
those in the U.S.Employee 
benefits
50At Mastercard, we place great 
emphasis on living our core 
principle of decency. We provide 
a number of training procedures 
to ensure that every employee 
feels valued and respected, with 
decency at the core, including:
• Respect in the Workplace
• People with Disabilities
• Annual Code of Conduct
• Videos on Decency
 We believe that creating the 
right experience for our employees 
empowers them to perform at 
their best. Our ongoing coaching 
and feedback processes support 
their career development 
and growth, including annual 
performance and development 
reviews for 95% of our employees 
in 2018. Additionally, formal and 
self-guided training and company-
wide recognition opportunities help 
all employees feel valued in their 
contributions to the company.
 As our employees seek to learn 
new skills or move to new roles, we 
offer a great breadth and depth 
of online, no-cost, self-paced 
learning opportunities, as well as 
a tuition assistance/reimbursement 
program to support our employees’ 
continuous learning.Just as we strive to recognize 
the good work our employees 
do every day, we want them to 
be empowered to tell us what 
Mastercard is doing well — and 
where we could be doing better.
 Our annual employee-
experience survey provides an 
opportunity to reflect on our 
progress as a company. In 2018, 
86% of our employees completed 
the survey, and 91% agreed with 
the statement, “I am proud to 
work for Mastercard.” Even so, 
our workforce highlighted a need 
to speed deployment of resources 
and to give feedback. In response, 
our Chief People Officer worked 
with the management committee 
to address opportunities for 
improvement on a global basis, 
including a continued focus on 
optimizing our operating model 
and developing new tools to 
provide more frequent coaching 
for employees while obtaining 
feedback from them. Our Career Launchpad 
program offers every employee a 
personalized career-development 
experience, including creating a 
career plan and detailing the skills, 
resources and relationships that 
will help them achieve their goals. 
In 2018, nearly 11,300 employees 
engaged in our formal learning 
tools for a total of more than 
160,000 hours of training. 
 Last year, we continued our 
employee-recognition program, 
Recognizing You, which rewards 
behavior that drives business 
results. We designed the program 
to encourage all employees to 
celebrate the big and small wins 
every day, express gratitude for the 
great work we do and recognize 
the efforts required to accomplish 
our goals. Over the course of the 
year, employees offered more 
than 26,000 recognition moments 
across Mastercard in more than  
60 countries.
 Recognizing You allows us to 
harness the power of recognition 
and empower expressions of thanks 
among all employees. Simple 
expressions of appreciation and 
recognition inspire us personally, 
create meaningful connections 
between us and transform our 
culture as a whole.Employee and leadership

recruiting
One way in which we have 
successfully recruited great 
new technologists to join 
our dynamic business is 
through our Management 
Graduate Development and 
MBA Management Associate 
programs.
 The full-time hires that joined 
the company through these 
programs represent diverse, 
high-performing talent in areas 
of strategic importance to 
Mastercard. They welcome the 
opportunity to work internationally 
and alongside senior leadership 
as a way of expanding their 
experiences and accelerating  
their career progression. This year, the company 
expanded the program with a 
threefold increase in college hiring 
across the globe, and also by 
establishing a robust University 
Relations Strategy to attract top-
notch students to compelling jobs 
at Mastercard. We have identified 
more than 100 schools across the 
globe, 67% of them outside the 
U.S., with which to build intensive, 
multiyear partnerships, creating 
mutually beneficial engagements 
to share our industry expertise 
with the world, accelerate the 
sharing of knowledge with the 
world’s best universities and 
make Mastercard a top-of-mind 
employer for the best students.

51Because our employees’ needs 
and regional requirements vary 
around the world, we have 
developed a core set of benefits 
we offer to all employees 
globally, upon which we tailor 
and customize benefits to meet 
local and regional needs.
 Among the core benefits we 
offer are health-care coverage and 
life insurance and retirement plans, 
as well as disability insurance and 
accident benefits to help them 
weather life’s misfortunes.
 We strengthened our global 
well-being offerings to help 
all employees to perform at 
their best, personally and 
professionally, within our three 
focus areas: physical, emotional 
and financial well-being. In the 
coming months, we will create 
a personalized experience that 
inspires daily engagement with 
well-being programs, activities 
and events, allowing employees to 
set and track personally important 
goals and achieve sustainable 
behavior that improves their 
overall well-being. EMPLOYEE HEALTH  
AND WELL-BEING
Driven by our 
philosophy to care 
for our workforce, 
Mastercard has 
created The Whole 
You, comprehensive 
benefits packages 
designed to promote 
good health and 
financial stability for 
our employees and 
their families. Our parental leave policy 
supports all of our colleagues in  
all geographies — regardless of 
race, gender, sexual orientation 
or local laws — for adoption and 
childbirth. This is consistent with 
who we are and our support of 
marriage equality. We also  
provide back-up child- and elder-
care options in several countries, 
as well as a bereavement-leave 
program globally.
 As part of our wellness focus 
at our U.S. operations, we offer 
employees workplace ergonomic 
assessments and on-site fitness 
centers in our Purchase and 
St. Louis locations. In addition, 
Mastercard has partnered with 
Rally Health, a digital health 
platform that makes it easy for 
employees to incorporate exercise 
and wellness activities into their 
daily routine. Our U.S. workforce 
and covered spouses/partners 
are eligible to earn up to $850 
each year in their Health Savings 
Accounts by engaging with Rally to 
maintain and track their wellness 
activities, such as visiting a doctor 
for their annual physical exams.
52Mastercard is committed to 
protecting the security of our 
company, brand, employees, 
facilities and information with 
technology, personnel and physical 
and logical controls to provide a 
safe working environment.
 Our Corporate Security 
department provides 
comprehensive coverage, 
monitoring, awareness and 
intelligence, advising on 
risk-mitigation and threat 
preparedness. Whether during 
corporate events, employee 
travel or daily operations at 
our workplaces, the Corporate 
Security team is proactively 
protecting Mastercard and  
its employees.Workspace safety

authorized to access employees’ 
health data receive detailed 
training about HIPAA to ensure 
ethical use.
 We are leveraging our offices 
as tools to improve and maintain 
our workforce’s well-being. Our 
Worldwide Design standards 
guide us to locate workstations 
where they receive optimal natural 
light, and we encourage active 
use of our facilities by centrally 
locating pantries, recycling 
facilities and common areas. We 
encourage our employees to rest 
and recharge with in-office quiet 
rooms, meditation rooms, wellness 
rooms and game rooms. Our 
larger facilities also include fitness 
centers and walking trails to 
facilitate movement throughout 
the day. In addition to making use of 
the latest security technologies 
for our workplaces, we’ve 
developed an e-learning platform 
to promote security awareness 
and communicate our security 
policies to our workforce, as well 
as virtual-reality safety training. 
Mastercard also offers enterprise-
wide classroom training on first

the program by translating the 
curriculum into 11 languages 
and creating partnerships with 
Scholastic, Be Better China, 
Singapore Committee for UN 
Women, Network for Teaching 
Entrepreneurship and Major 
League Baseball  to advance 
STEM education. Mastercard’s donation-
matching program doubles 
the impact of our employees’ 
financial support for qualifying 
organizations. We also encourage 
every full-time employee to spend 
as many as five workdays per 
year engaging in volunteering 
and community activities. Every 
employee who volunteers at least 
40 hours per year to a single 
organization is eligible to apply for 
up to four $500 grants annually

178 employees in the U.S. and 
U.K. serving as yearlong mentors 
to more than 350 members of 
the military, supporting them as 
they re-enter civilian life. As of 
December 2018, there were 43 
active Mastercard mentorships, 
and since 2015, 99 veterans have 
obtained employment during their 
Mastercard mentorships. 
 In 2018, we conducted a survey 
of participants and learned that 
100% are glad that Mastercard is 
participating, would recommend 
ACP to a colleague and would 
participate again. In addition, 
the majority of veterans said 
they had improved their resume 
and interview skills, with half 
translating their military service  
to corporate America.Teaching tomorrow’s

Mastercard and the World Food 
Programme (WFP) have been 
partners since 2012, focusing 
on the transformational power 
of school meals, which can help 
improve children’s health, cognitive 
development, access to education 
and future lifetime earnings. The 
partnership includes multiple 
elements, such as cause marketing, 
consumer fundraising, grants, 
support for emergencies, expertise 
and employee engagement.
 In partnership with WFP , 
we provide opportunities each 
year for our employees to give 
back, using their knowledge and 
skills. Employees conduct cost-
benefit analyses that help local 
governments around the world 
better understand the long-term 
benefits that school meals provide 
for children and their economies. 
Twelve Mastercard employees 
from 10 countries went on four-
week missions to complete these 
analyses in Laos, Benin, Malawi, 
Uganda, Indonesia and Ghana.

STEWARDSHIP
56Global companies have both an 
opportunity and a responsibility to 
contribute solutions for the world’s 
environmental challenges, including 
climate change. OUR APPROACH
5757At Mastercard, we have set 
ambitious goals and are taking 
action across our company and 
supply chain to support the 
Paris Agreement target to limit 
global warming to well below  
2 degrees Celsius.
 In addition to addressing our 
climate impacts, we are working 
to improve Mastercard’s overall 
environmental performance by 
reducing our waste and natural 
resource impacts and designing 
solutions for a sustainable future. 
 Our approach has not changed. 
Our first priority is continuously 
improving the environmental 
footprint of our offices and 
operations. The next step is 
ensuring our electronic payment 
solutions are built on a sustainable 
foundation by increasing the 
energy efficiency of our network 
and data centers and by investing 
in renewable resources. We also 
look to our supplier base. In 2018, 
we launched our Environmental Development Initiative to reduce 
our biggest carbon impacts, 
Scope 3 emissions in our supply 
chain. We also continue to 
develop environmentally conscious 
solutions to help the world reach 
a sustainable future. 
 We take pride in our 
environmental leadership, which 
goes hand-in-hand with our 
vision for inclusive growth. Too 
often, the people excluded from 
economic opportunity are those 
who shoulder the burden of the 
world’s environmental challenges, 
especially climate change. By 
using all our resources as a global 
company, we can be a force for 
good in building an inclusive, 
environmentally sustainable world.OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS

most pressing urban issues.• We joined Green Lease Leaders 
and began incorporating green 
leasing language into requests 
for proposals and leases to help 
tenants and landlords make 
sustainable decisions.
• We certified eight new buildings 
as green, bringing our total up 
from 74% in 2017 . 
• 79% of our owned and operated 
facilities’ total square footage 
is either green-building certified 
or located in a building that 
achieved green certification in 
that area of the world. 
• Our Vietnam office became the

59ENSURING OUR  
SUSTAINABILITY
Making our payment 
solutions environmentally 
sustainable means 
minimizing Mastercard’s 
contributions to climate 
change and limiting our 
natural resource use and 
waste output.
These efficiencies benefit our 
business and help us reduce our 
overall environmental impact.  
We are also working with 
suppliers to improve their 
environmental performance. Our primary teams responsible 
for improving our environmental 
performance and that of our 
supply chain are our global 
Real Estate and Sourcing and 
Supplier Management, which 
regularly report results to our 
Chief Financial Officer. Our 
Board of Directors’ Nominating 
and Corporate Governance 
Committee oversees all of our 
environmental initiatives, including 
investments in environmentally 
beneficial products and services.
60We are one of about 600 
leading companies to align our 
climate goals with the Paris 
Agreement’s commitment 
to limit global warming to 
well below 2 degrees Celsius. 
We announced an emissions-
reduction goal that was 
independently assessed  
and approved by the Science 
Based Targets initiative. In 
undertaking a rigorous process 
to specify how much and how 
quickly we will reduce our GHG 
emissions, we became the first 
payments company to set a 
science-based goal.
 We are working hard to reduce 
our absolute Scope 1, Scope 2 and 
Scope 3 emissions — including our 
direct, indirect and supply chain 
emissions — by 20% by 2025,  
from a 2016 baseline. 
 Our first step has been to 
understand the origins of our 
climate impacts. Our biggest 
impacts come from the goods 
and services we purchase through 
our supply chain, followed by our 
buildings and facilities, including 
operation of our data centers. Doing our  
part on climate 
with science-
based goals The next step is managing 
emissions, and we have set 
an ongoing goal to source 
100% renewable energy, even 
as Mastercard grows. We are 
implementing a long-term 
strategy to procure more 
renewable energy through 
on-site installations and, 
where practical, to reduce our 
dependence on renewable 
energy credits. We also cut 
our emissions through energy 
efficiency, green building and 
better transportation solutions. 
Additionally, we collaborate with 
our suppliers to reduce their 
emissions. In recognition of this 
work, Mastercard received a 
2019 Climate Leadership Award 
from the Center for Climate and 
Energy Solutions (C2ES) and the 
Climate Registry.  We value transparency, and 
we have participated in CDP’s 
Climate Change survey since 2010 
and in its Supply Chain survey 
since 2013. We have quantified 
the emissions of our supply chain 
so we can identify opportunities 
for the greatest reductions.  
In 2019, CDP recognized 
Mastercard as a leader with an 
“A” Supplier Engagement Rating. 
We are also closely following the 
development of standardized 
climate disclosures, including the 
recommendations of the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD).

In 2016, we changed our GHG accounting methodology from ownership control to operational control in order to measure our emissions more comprehensively. Our Scope 1 and Scope 2 measurements now include both owned and leased sites.  
We also began calculating our Scope 3 emissions in 2016. Our data from previous years are therefore no longer comparable. The 2018 Scope 1 and Scope 2 decrease was the result of some of our larger energy-saving initiatives, including updated 
design standards, upgraded space design to use an open layout plan, and energy metering at all new and renovated spaces. Our GHG Inventory is subject to updates, per our Inventory Management Plan.SCOPE 1 AND 2 BREAKDOWN

63Mastercard doesn't produce 
physical goods, so more than 
70% of our emissions come 
from the goods and services 
we purchase from upstream 
suppliers.
 Addressing our Scope 3 supply 
chain emissions makes up a 
significant part of our effort to 
support the Paris Agreement. 
We have been working for quite 
some time to reduce our Scope 
1 and Scope 2 emissions, and we 
increased our focus on Scope 3 
emissions in 2018.Addressing our 
biggest carbon 
footprint: supply 
chain emissions In collaboration with CDP 
Supply Chain Services and 
Trucost, our Sourcing and Supplier 
Management team identified the 
suppliers that contribute most of 
our Scope 3 emissions. Based on 
this analysis, we have defined four 
broad categories that constitute 
our biggest supply chain emissions: 
technical consulting, advertising, 
sponsorships and consumer 
benefits, and real estate and 
computer-related services. 
 Building on this analysis, we 
have been working one-on-one 
with suppliers to gain a deeper 
understanding of their emissions 
and to collaborate on strategies  
to measure, disclose and reduce 
their emissions. Like many in our industry, we 
examine impacts from travel 
and employee commuting, but 
we go even further to include our 
purchased goods and services, 
the capital goods we use in our 
operations, and the fuel- and 
energy-related emissions not 
included in Scope 1 and Scope 2. 
We believe this broader approach 
supports both our climate goals 
and progress toward the Paris 
Agreement. 
 Since our base year of 2016, 
we have decreased our Scope 1, 
Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions by 
42%. Even as our total purchasing 
increased in the past two years, 
the overall GHG intensity of our 
supply chain decreased. Dollar-
for-dollar, our expenditures are 
less GHG-intensive, putting us on 
a good path to meet our 2025 
absolute goal.

 The CDP recognized Mastercard 
on its 2019 Supplier Engagement 
Leader Board. Mastercard was 
the only payments company 
to achieve an “A” grade when 
evaluated against the Supplier 
Engagement Rating methodology, 
which looks at governance, 
targets, Scope 3 emissions and 
value-chain engagement.
65To support our Scope 3  
emissions targets, we are 
working with suppliers on  
their climate initiatives.
 While some suppliers work with 
us for many years, we do not use 
the same suppliers every year, so 
we have established an annual 
target to engage a percentage 
of them. We aim to achieve that 
target every year through 2025. 
 An important strategy is to 
engage suppliers through the CDP , 
which affords greater visibility into 
our supply chain GHG footprint. 
This allows us to begin setting 
expectations and plan further 
engagement with the suppliers. We invited suppliers that 
represented approximately 65% 
of our global procurement spend 
to report to the CDP . Of those 
suppliers, 50% responded, and  
we are pleased to report that  
of those who responded: Engaging our

66We enhance our environmental 
performance by pursuing 
external green building 
certifications wherever possible 
and by working continuously to 
improve the energy efficiency of 
our buildings. We build, maintain 
and plan over time to improve 
the sustainability of all our 
owned and leased spaces.
 Mastercard’s Global Workplace 
Design Standards embed 
efficiency into the design-and-
construction process from 
the start. We pursue green 
certification for all eligible 
projects, aligning our green 
building practices with global and 
local standards. Today, our owned 
campuses are all Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED)–certified, and more than 
79% of Mastercard’s total square 
footage is either green-building-
certified or in a building that 
meets green certification for its 
region. In 2018, we certified eight 
additional buildings. To ensure that 
our properties continue to meet 
our high standards, we recertify 
them as needed. Energy efficiency  
and green buildings
 We also pursue certifications 
outside our owned campuses. Our 
Vietnam office was the first in 
that country to achieve the status 
of LOTUS Gold for Small Interiors, 
and we were able to LEED-certify 
more than 370,000 square feet  
in India.
 We also require all new 
buildouts to meet a leading 
green certification standard and 
include energy-efficiency design 
standards. For instance, we are 
using LEED v4.1 to recertify the 
interior spaces in our leased offices 
in the U.S. and Latin America.
 We gathered additional 
primary data about our leased 
sites by installing sub-metering 
technology in many of our new 
and existing office spaces. This 
allows us to make targeted, site-
specific energy improvements 
that support our science-based 
emissions goals. We were successful in  
reducing our Scope 1 and  
Scope 2 emissions by 
implementing some larger  
energy-saving initiatives,  
including updating design 
standards to require energy 
metering, plug-load management 
and energy-efficient appliances; 
upgrading space design to an 
open layout plan, saving 1.25 
watts per desk; and using energy 
metering at all new and renovated 
spaces. Additional changes that 
contributed to energy savings 
include design guidelines that 
specify lighting levels per office 
area, advanced lighting controls 
that account for office occupancy 
and daylight hours, LED upgrades 
and retrofits, and partnerships 
with utilities to assess and identify 
energy-saving opportunities.
67We have achieved 100% 
renewable energy for our global 
real estate portfolio, and we aim 
to continue meeting this goal, 
even as our portfolio expands. 
We are developing a long-term 
strategy to shift a larger portion 
of our energy sourcing from 
renewable energy credits and 
directly procured renewable 
electricity to on-site solar and 
other direct, renewable sources.
 When it comes to purchasing 
renewable energy credits, we buy 
country-specific credits in many 
locations where we have offices 
to help “green the grid” in those 
countries.
 In 2018, we completed the 
second phase of solar panel 
development at our technology 
headquarters in Missouri and 
at our global headquarters in 
Purchase, New York. These solar 
arrays will generate up to 15%  
of the electricity consumed at  
those locations. In 2018, these solar arrays 
generated 1,725,811 kilowatt-
hours (kWh) of renewable 
energy, or 9.6% of the electricity 
consumed at those offices, 
outperforming our projected 
annual creation of 1.3 million 
kWh. (This performance was a 
result of getting these projects 
online sooner than expected and 
reaping the benefits of a sunnier-
than-average year.) In the next 
three years, we plan to more than 
double on-site renewable energy 
creation, partly via expansion to 
additional sites.Green buildings

68We are helping reduce the 
impacts of employee travel 
and commutes through the 
use of virtual meetings and the 
purchase of carbon offsets for 
all business travel.
 We also try to minimize the 
need for employee car travel by 
selecting office spaces that have 
high walkability scores and are 
close to public transportation. 
We support our employees’ 
green transportation choices 
by providing bicycle allowances, 
shuttle-bus services and car-
charging stations (including new 
stations added at two of our 
U.S. offices and at our office in 
Belgium, plus charging stations 
available at other leased office 
spaces outside the U.S.). For 
people who bike, walk or run to 
work, we provide on-site bicycle 
storage and showers. We also 
offer work-from-home policies.TransportationWe exceeded our goal of recycling, 
diverting or composting 70% of waste 
generated in our owned facilities: We 
diverted 77% of waste from landfills. 
Based on this success, we have updated

global protocol to eliminate single-
use plastics from our offices; we 
now provide reusable drinkware,

facilities.
 We recycle, reuse or donate 
all of our office furniture globally, 
and we work with suppliers to 
decrease their use of packaging

and we also work closely with 
our furniture suppliers to ensure 
they use reusable packaging 
such as blankets. Our global IT 
department works to ensure that 
we divert from landfills 100% of 
the electronic waste from each  
of our offices.

Beyond managing our 
own environmental 
footprint, we take 
advantage of 
opportunities to 
apply our people, 
assets and innovation 
toward a more 
sustainable future.Even as the use of plastics 
grows, people everywhere now 
recognize how plastics impact 
the environment. Every year, 
almost 400 million tons5 of plastic 
are produced, with plastics 
in packaging materials now 
representing nearly half of all 
plastic waste generated globally.6
 Most is never recycled.7 A lot 
of plastic waste ends up in water 
streams, and it is estimated that 
more than 8 million tons8 of plastic 
annually makes its way into the sea.
 Many consumers have started 
limiting single-use plastics such 
as bags and straws and have 
begun to demand that businesses 
use their influence for positive 
action on plastic. To support this 
movement, Mastercard joined 
with card manufacturers Gemalto, Greener Payments Partnership:

than 33,000 tons (30,000 metric tonnes) (less than 0.01% of annual plastic manufacturing,  
which reached nearly 400 million tons).We contribute environmentally 
conscious solutions in a variety 
of ways, from innovations that 
reduce first-use plastic in our 
cards to new kinds of payment 
systems that make it easier 
for people to afford and access 
clean energy and water.
 We also contribute to

alternative materials for cards, 
including recyclable, bio-sourced 
and biodegradable materials. While 
plastic used in payments cards 
represents only 0.01% of plastic 
volume, we intend to do our part.9
 The GPP is looking at the 
lifecycle of payment cards to 
identify viable, sustainable solutions 
that we can scale up across the 
industry via collaborative action. 
We are confident that we can build 
on recent research to drive large-

reduce environmental impacts and 
help cardholders track, understand 
and offset the carbon impacts 
from items they purchase.
Creation:  How can we select 
better card material to reduce 
first-use PVC by 2025? We are 
considering a variety of materials, 
including ethically sourced 
PVC, bio-sourced industrially 
compostable options, ocean-

and chlorine-free options.
Offsetting:  How can we help 
cardholders track, understand 
and reduce their carbon footprints 
through carbon offsetting?
Recycle: How can we support 
centralized recycling programs 
by engaging the companies 
that issue cards? We want to 
encourage card issuers to return 
cards at expiration so we can 
recycle precious materials and 
help achieve our ultimate zero-

71In many parts of the world, 
people do not have access to 
affordable, clean energy and 
safe water. In sub-Saharan 
Africa, for instance, 560 million 
lack access to electricity,10 
instead using kerosene, candles 
and batteries. These are unsafe 
and unreliable power sources, 
and they can also harm the 
environment. Water is also a 
challenge: Globally, one in nine 
people lacks access to safe 
water,11 and one in three lacks 
access to a toilet. At Mastercard, 
we are looking for new ways to 
support access to environmental 
resources that are essential to 
everyday life, including clean 
energy and water. Expanding our PayGo technology 
to support access to clean energy 
and water 
 We partnered with M-KOPA 
Solar  and Centenary Bank  to use 
Mastercard’s Quick Response (QR) 
payment technology in Uganda, 
giving more people a simple, 
pay-as-you-go (PAYG) option to 
purchase M-KOPA’s affordable, 
safe and clean solar energy. 
This program builds on our 
partnership  announcement with 
M-KOPA Solar in 2017 by adding 
new product capabilities we hope 
will help scale PAYG solutions, so 
more people — in Uganda and 
beyond — gain access to clean 
energy and water. Developed by Mastercard 
Labs, our new PayGo  API solution 
combines low-cost QR technology, 
an open and interoperable 
technology, with the “internet of 
things.” This technology allows 
customers to make secure, 
efficient payments from their 
mobile phones by scanning a 
QR (Quick Response) code or 
using a USSD (Unstructured 
Supplementary Service Data) 
interface. By expanding the PAYG 
partnership to include Centenary 
Bank — a commercial microfinance 
bank in Uganda serving 1.6 million 
customers12 (a quarter13 of the 
country’s banking population) — 
we have the opportunity to scale 
up this payment solution.
 Looking forward, we hope 
that by making this payment 
technology widely available 
and partnering with new 
organizations, we’ll be able to 
help more people access the clean 
energy and water they need.

72IMPROVING  
SUSTAINABILITY  
IN URBAN TRANSIT
Cities are growing at 
an unprecedented 
rate, with 6 million 
people moving to 
urban areas every 
month in search of 
opportunity.
By 2050, around 70% of the 
world’s population is expected 
to live in urban areas.14 Urban 
tourism is also booming:  
By 2030, 1.8 billion people are 
expected to visit cities annually.15 This influx opens up 
tremendous opportunities, from 
increased cultural and commercial 
growth to innovation: Today, 
93% of the world’s patents are 
generated in cities.16 Because 
rapid urban growth impacts the 
environment, however, 70% of 
global carbon-dioxide emissions 
now come from cities.17
 Public transit can help reduce 
these environmental impacts, so 
we are partnering with more than 
150 global cities to make public 
transit management smarter 
and more efficient. We are also 
working to encourage ridership 
and boost transit systems’ 
capacity to meet growing 
demand. With our solutions, 
people can use payment cards or 
mobile devices as the only tickets 
they need to get around — by 
train, bus, ferry or bike-share.  This can shorten lines and 
speed passengers through 
turnstiles, helping make 
environmentally sound transit 
the more convenient choice. We 
are also developing incentives 
for people to travel during 
non-peak times, reducing 
congestion and helping transit 
systems support more riders.
 Our next-generation urban 
mobility solutions fall into 
three categories: physical card 
solutions that help riders “tap 
and go,” digital and mobile 
solutions that help riders book 
their entire trip through a single 
app and intelligent mobility 
solutions that allow cities to 
learn from data insights derived 
from commuting trends.

73Building on our partnership-
based approach to improving 
public transit, we pioneered City 
Possible. This new model for 
urban collaboration brings cities, 
companies and communities 
together to identify common 
challenges and create solutions 
that can be scaled up broadly.
 As a company, Mastercard 
focuses on advancing inclusive 
urbanization, using our technology, 
data insights and partnerships 
to improve efficiency, promote 
economic growth and ensure 
inclusion. We are excited that City 
Possible supports mayors and city 
leaders in upgrading urban quality  
of life.
 Three interconnected pillars form 
the foundation of City Possible:
1. Global network:  
Cities and communities define

To date, our partnerships with 
cities have brought a number  
of positive impacts:
• In London, 55% of all Tube and 
rail PayGo  journeys are regularly 
made using contactless 
payment cards or mobile 
devices,18 serving cardholders 
from more than 100 countries.19
• In Sydney, following a successful 
trial with Mastercard, 
commuters and tourists can 
now Tap & Go® across all of the 
city’s ferries and light railways.
• In Singapore, Mastercard was 
the first international payments 
network to partner20 with the 
Land Transport Authority to 
launch SimplyGo, an account-
based ticketing system that 
enables “tap & go” on the city’s 
public transport system.• In 113 stations21 in Milan, 
Mastercard has implemented22 
campaigns to drive contactless 
usage in transit and 
encourage similar behavior for 
micropayments beyond transit.
• Over the course of just three 
months in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, 
we launched a fully open loop 
transit system.

74As a key component of City 
Possible, Mastercard has 
partnered with Harvard 
University’s Technology and 
Entrepreneurship Center (TECH), 
which is hosting a series of 
programs for global city leaders 
to identify common challenges, 
discuss solutions, share data 
and exchange insights related 
to urban planning, mobility 
services and more. To date, these 
programs have taken place in Las 
Vegas, Melbourne and Boston. 
Participants also have access to 
an online community where they 
can continue the dialogue with 
their peers.
 Looking ahead, Mastercard 
and Kisio will invite and select 
cities from the global City Possible 
network to co-create and pilot a 
Mobility-as-a-Service platform 
that fully integrates with local 
transit authorities.Mastercard joined the Steering 
Committee of the UN Global 
Compact Cities Programme 
(the Global Compact’s urban 
arm), through which city and 
regional governments collaborate 
with the private sector and civil 
society to address complex global 
challenges on the local level.
 As the Steering Committee’s 
only corporate partner, 
Mastercard helps select partner 
cities. We are supporting the 
development of a sustainable 
business model for the cities 
program, and we are helping lead 
partnerships that can accelerate 
implementation of the UN

At Mastercard, we are 
proud to have received 
a number of prestigious 
awards recognizing our 
ethical and responsible 
performance.

Mastercard earned its third 
consecutive place among the 
World’s Most Ethical Companies 
for our efforts to lead with 
integrity and to promote 
ethical business standards 
and practices, internally and 
externallyOur deep commitment to ethical 
operations and legal compliance 
shapes every interaction with 
our employees, our stakeholders 
and our customers. We build 
our operations around the 
touchstones of decency, integrity 
and respect in service of our four 
core values:
Trust:  We act with integrity and 
respect; we encourage openness
Partnership:  We work as one 
team to the benefit of all — 
consumers, merchants, business 
partners, governments and the 
communities we serve
Agility:  We act with a sense of 
urgency and deliver value through 
our innovation and execution 
Initiative:  We are empowered  
to take bold and thoughtful 
action, and we hold ourselves 
accountable for delivering results Upholding these values in 
our workplaces and across our 
operations is one reason why 
Mastercard is the place where  
the best people want to be.
 Mastercard earned a number 
of awards recognizing our efforts 
to treat people with decency 
and to earn and maintain our 
customers’ trust. We continued 
to build on those efforts with 
important updates to our data 
privacy practices, as with our 
EU General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) compliance 
efforts, our data security 
innovations that include Threat 
Scan and AI Express, and our 
expansion of the scope of our 
supplier diversity efforts.
78Our approach to ethical 
operations starts with our Code 
of Conduct . It is the cornerstone 
of our Ethics and Compliance 
system and central to our culture 
of decency.
 We offer the Code in multiple 
languages to guide all our 
employees in making the right 
decisions, including detailing 
managers’ responsibilities, 
avoiding conflicts of interest, 
honoring our policies and ensuring 
privacy and data protection. Ethical business practicesETHICS AND COMPLIANCE
Mastercard’s continued 
business success is tied, in part, 
to our commitment to meet 
and exceed our partners’ and 
customers’ expectations that  
we will deliver our products  
and services in the right way.
 We also require our CEO and 
other senior officers to abide by 
a Supplemental Code of Ethics , 
which reflects our heightened 
expectations for them to lead by 
example, particularly in taking 
special care to avoid conflicts  
of interest.
79Working to  
ensure compliance
Every Mastercard employee 
participates in a mandatory, 
in-depth curriculum of online 
compliance training. The training 
curriculum consists of a two-
year rotation of more than 
15 training courses, including 
Code of Conduct, anti-money 
laundering, trade sanctions, data 
privacy, information security, 
preventing insider trading and 
workplace conduct that includes 
harassment and discrimination.
  In addition to the above 
training, which lays the foundation 
of our culture of decency and 
compliance, our Mastercard Ethics 
Helpline offers all employees, 
contingent workers, third 
parties and the public at large 
a confidential, around-the-clock 
service to report suspected 
violations of the law, our Code of 
Conduct or any other company 
policy. The Helpline is hosted 
by an independent third party, 
and anonymous reports can be 
made where permitted by local 
law. We promptly, thoroughly 
and objectively investigate all 
concerns with our relevant internal 
investigative functions, and we 
bring in external support, such as 
outside counsel, as needed. To increase transparency 
regarding our investigative process 
and associated outcomes, twice 
a year we provide our employees 
with a Summary of Investigative 
Activity that contains investigative 
metrics and select anonymized 
case profiles.
 To encourage the use of the 
Helpline and other avenues for 
raising ethical or legal concerns, 
we have a Non-Retaliation Policy 
that forbids retaliation against 
anyone who asks a question, raises 
a concern or provides good-faith 
information about potential legal 
or policy violations. Anyone found 
in breach of the Non-Retaliation 
Policy will be subject to disciplinary 
action, up to and including 
termination of employment.
Mastercard sits at the center of 
the global payments industry, and 
we have made innovative efforts 
to prevent our products, services 
and technologies from being used 
for laundering money, financing 
terrorist operations or evading 
economic sanctions.
80EVERY MASTERCARD 
EMPLOYEE UNDERGOES  
IN-DEPTH TRAINING ON 
OUR CODE OF CONDUCT
 Our comprehensive risk-
mitigation strategy — including 
policies, procedures and employee 
education, in addition to our 
technological tools — ensures 
that we meet our regulatory 
obligations. We continue to 
incorporate technology and 
dynamic, data-driven controls to 
advance our ability to identify, 
assess and mitigate risks.
 We comply with anti-corruption 
laws around the world, including 
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Our 
Code of Conduct and related 
policies prohibit offering payments 
or anything of value to improperly 
influence a business decision or 
gain an unfair business advantage, 
and we have implemented training 
and internal controls to proactively 
manage corruption risks, wherever 
they arise. We have developed an 
innovative compliance platform 
to allow us to regularly monitor 
compliance with anti-corruption 
procedures across our global 
operations, and each year we 
conduct a comprehensive anti-
corruption risk assessment. 
 Our Chief Compliance Officer 
(CCO) leads and oversees our 
Ethics and Compliance system, 
which encompasses a broad set 
of integrated programs. The 
CCO also chairs Mastercard’s 
Ethics and Compliance 
Operating Council, a network of 
Compliance Liaisons that spans 
our business lines and regions 
and helps drive organizational 
engagement, alignment and 
accountability within our Ethics 
and Compliance system. The 
CCO reports functionally to the 
Audit Committee of the Board of 
Directors and administratively to 
the General Counsel.Antitrust and 
competition law
Mastercard is committed to a 
fully competitive marketplace, 
encouraging open and dynamic 
markets that drive innovation and 
value for our company and our 
customers. Mastercard competes 
independently in the marketplace 
by creating innovative products 
and services that are attractive 
to its customers. Mastercard 
maintains internal policies and 
training to educate employees 
regarding anticompetitive 
business practices.
 Mastercard’s Global Antitrust 
and Competition Law Policy is 
incorporated into its Code of 
Conduct, which is reviewed annually 
and attested to by every employee. 
This policy is designed to ensure 
that every employee is aware of 
and sensitive to legal principles 
regarding competition and knows 
how to raise questions and voice 
concerns. In addition, Mastercard 
has developed Competitive 
Intelligence Guidelines that set 
forth areas for the appropriate 
gathering of market intelligence.
 An online antitrust training 
course incorporates the key 
antitrust principles and guidance 
contained in both polices. Regional 
counsel also provides in-person 
training for relevant business units, 
where needed.Mastercard is committed to 
engaging appropriately in the 
political process and policy arena 
in a manner that informs and 
affects the debate concerning 
issues related to our business, 
investors and customers — 
including, but not limited to, 
payment system innovation, 
data privacy, the regulation of 
digital transactions, taxation 
and other issues disclosed in the 
company’s public filings.  
 We strive to engage on these 
issues in the most responsible and 
ethical way. Mastercard maintains 
internal procedures to ensure 
that the company’s political 
and public policy activities fully 
comply with all laws, regulations 
and company policies. Any such 
activities in which Mastercard 
engages are based solely upon the 
best interests of the Company 
and are made without regard to 
the private political preferences 
of its officers and/or executives. 
Mastercard semiannually 
discloses on its website political 
contributions and independent 
expenditures, if any.Political activity 
and public policy 
81 We developed our 
Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) program to support 
comprehensive, integrated 
oversight and management of 
existing and emerging risks, and 
to facilitate transparent risk 
identification and risk reporting 
to senior management and the 
Board. All employees play a role 
in helping Mastercard achieve 
its strategic objectives through 
the execution of their assigned 
responsibilities and are expected 
to understand, monitor and 
escalate risks related to their 
roles, while recommending 
controls where appropriate. 
 An important element of our 
risk-management framework 
includes embedding risk 
champions in the business to 
help drive risk-management 
activities within business units 
in order to better prepare the 
company to respond to new  
and emerging risks.OUR BOARD AND 
MANAGEMENT 
CONTINUOUSLY  
IMPROVE OUR  
RISK-MANAGEMENT 
PRACTICES The Risk Management 
Committee (RMC), composed of 
senior executives, is responsible for 
guiding our ERM program; several 
RMC members report regularly to 
the Board and its committees to 
help establish the appropriate risk 
culture and align risk management 
with Mastercard’s strategy. More 
information about the three 
standing Board committees that 
further oversee risk management 
is available in our 2019 Proxy 
Statement  and 10-K Risk  
Factors  filing.
 Mastercard’s Board and 
management work to continuously 
improve our risk-management 
framework and organization at 
both the corporate and business-
unit levels. We established new 
processes and methodologies to 
evaluate risks against our Risk 
Appetite Statement targets and to 
balance the need for stability and 
reliability against agility, innovation 
and entrepreneurial risk-taking.RESPONSIBLE RISK 
MANAGEMENT 
Properly managed  
risk-taking in business 
is a critical component 
of innovation and 
leadership.
Our Board of Directors, which 
oversees our risk-management 
framework, seeks to foster a risk-
aware culture while engaging in 
thoughtful risk-taking to serve  
our business objectives.
82Our long-standing commitment 
to data ethics helps us earn 
and maintain the trust of 
our partners and contribute 
to better outcomes while 
respecting people’s privacy.PRIVACY, DATA 
PROTECTION,  
AND SAFETY AND  
SECURITY SOLUTIONS
Privacy and data 
protection are woven 
into the fabric of our 
business and are 
a vital part of our 
responsibility to our 
customers, account 
holders and employees.Our core commitment to privacy 
runs deep at Mastercard, 
starting with our Board, CEO 
and senior leadership.
 We train every employee to 
treat data with the utmost care 
in compliance with all applicable 
laws and regulations and in line 
with our culture of decency.Organizational 
culturePrivacy by Design:  
embedded in how 
we work
Privacy by Design is at the heart 
of Mastercard’s privacy strategy. 
We build privacy and data 
protection into how we design, 
develop and deliver our products 
and services. 
 We use personal information 
only in a legitimate, fair and 
inclusive manner, with full respect 
for the choices made by individuals. 
In addition, we always look for ways 
to encrypt, de-identify or anonymize 
personal information while making 
sure each product is still easy to use 
and convenient. For instance, when 
we process a transaction, we may 
replace an account holder’s account 
number with a token so that the 
actual card number is not accessible 
to the merchants from whom the 
cardholder shops.
 Any time we use personal 
information in a new way — such 
as by using biometric data to 
authenticate individuals — we 
conduct a privacy and data 
protection impact assessment 
to ensure we are aware of, 
and can minimize, any risks to 
people’s privacy and security. We 
contractually require our partners 
and vendors to meet or exceed 
our high standards for privacy and 
security, and we conduct annual 
security reviews of our systems  
and theirs to ensure compliance. We protect our network 
against security threats and also 
offer a range of security products 
and services designed to prevent 
and detect cyberattacks and 
fraud and to protect the security, 
confidentiality and integrity of our 
account holders’ and customers’ 
information.
83WE HOLD OURSELVES 
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE HIGHEST 
STANDARDS OF GLOBAL PRIVACY 
AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS
Privacy and compliance checks, 
as well as audits of our data 
and privacy practices, are a 
regular feature of how we ensure 
the health of our policies and 
practices.
 Mastercard’s security, privacy 
and information practices 
are reviewed by U.S. financial 
regulators on a biannual basis. 
Our Binding Corporate Rules  
(BCRs), which have been reviewed 
and approved by European 
data protection authorities, 
allow us to transfer European 
personal information to other 
Mastercard entities globally in 
a way that respects people’s 
privacy. In Asia-Pacific, we’ve been 
awarded privacy certifications 
under the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border 
Privacy Rules and the Privacy 
Recognition for Processors system. 
(For more information:  
http://cbprs.org. ) Our new Data Protection 
Officer, appointed in 2018 and 
based in Europe, is responsible for 
ensuring our ongoing compliance 
with the GDPR. The Data 
Protection Officer Is involved in all 
issues that relate to the GDPR and 
the protection of personal data 
in the European Economic Area 
(EEA), including the handling of 
privacy requests from individuals, 
and is the contact point for the 
EEA data protection authorities.
 Mastercard partnered with IBM 
to launch Trūata, an independent 
data trust designed to anonymize 
data and continue providing 
analytic services in a GDPR-
compliant manner. In November, 
Mastercard was recognized by 
the International Association 
of Privacy Professionals for the 
innovation mindset that helped 
shape Trūata.We hold ourselves accountable  
to the highest standards 
of global privacy and data 
protection laws. When the 
EU General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) entered 
into full force in May 2018, 
Mastercard took advantage of 
the opportunity to review all 
of our products, services and 
processes to ensure we meet and 
exceed the law’s requirements. 
 We have also taken the 
opportunity to expand our 
commitment to ethical data 
practices by making the core 
consumer protections of the EU-
GDPR available to individuals in 
other jurisdictions by the end of 
the first quarter of 2020.  This 
includes the right for individuals 
to understand the personal data 
Mastercard has collected about 
them, the right to obtain a copy  
of the data, have the data 
corrected and/or deleted.AccountabilityIndividuals’ 
data rights
Audits and 
Certifications Under the GDPR and many 
privacy laws, individuals have 
a right to understand how 
Mastercard handles their data. 
We updated our Global Privacy 
Notice and our service-specific 
privacy notices to provide a  
clear and simple explanation  
of how we handle their  
personal information.  
 In response to the GDPR, we 
launched a new My Data online 
portal to enable individuals 
to exercise their new rights to 
access, correct, modify or move 
their personal information. The 
portal is currently available to 
all users in the European Union 
and will soon be accessible 
worldwide. We have also 
updated our comprehensive 
incident-response process to 
investigate and remedy any 
data incident and inform people 
if the incident may have put 
their privacy at risk. We regularly 
conduct data-breach exercises to 
test and continuously improve the 
effectiveness of our process.
84We believe that ethical, 
responsible data use can be  
a transformative force for 
societal good.
 That is why we actively 
engage with governments, 
regulators and policymakers 
around the world to show how 
our industry uses information 
for innovation and economic 
development and to explain how 
we incorporate privacy, security 
and data protection into all 
of our products, services and 
technologies. These discussions 
enable us to continue building 
the next generation of payment 
technologies while also protecting 
the rights of individuals and 
groups. We also partner with  
think tanks, academics and 
nonprofit organizations such  
as the Rockefeller Foundation  
to promote the use of data for 
social impact.Constructive 
collaboration  Data and privacy 
governance
Several of Mastercard’s 
senior executives hold the 
responsibility of upholding our 
company-wide commitment to 
best practices in data security.  
Chief Data Officer  
Oversees Mastercard’s efforts 
to maintain a responsible, ethical 
enterprise data program that 
adheres to our high standards 
for data quality, curation and 
governance. Reports to the 
President of our Data & Services 
Business but is an enterprise-wide 
position. On an as-needed basis, 
the Chief Data Officer provides 
an update to senior management 
and the Board of Directors on 
our data practices, including 
an assessment of our data risk 
and progress related to the use 
of information as part of our 
innovation strategy. .
Chief Privacy Officer  
Leads our compliance with 
worldwide laws and regulations 
regarding how we collect, use, 
share, store and transfer data, 
and manages our relevant 
engagements with regulators 
and policymakers. Reports 
directly to Mastercard’s General 
Counsel. On an annual basis, or 
more frequently if needed, the 
Chief Privacy Officer provides a comprehensive assessment of  
the program and related privacy 
and data protection risks to the 
Audit Committee of our Board  
of Directors.
Chief Security Officer   
Develops and oversees the 
policies, programs and controls 
we have created to reduce and 
prevent logical and physical 
risks to our people, intellectual 
assets and tangible property. 
On an annual basis, and more 
frequently as needed, the Chief 
Security Officer (CSO) provides 
a comprehensive assessment of 
the program and related risks 
and vulnerabilities to the Audit 
Committee of the Board of 
Directors. Additionally, the CSO 
periodically conducts briefings for 
the Chief Executive Officer, or a 
designee, on security initiatives 
and emerging threats, trends  
and tactics that could impact  
the organization.
Data Protection Officer
Supports our compliance with 
the GDPR and the protection of 
personal data in the European

Crimes Agency, the NSA and the 
U.S. Army Cyber Command.WE BUILD PRIVACY AND DATA

DESIGN, DEVELOP AND DELIVER 
OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
85Fusion Center
Mastercard built on the success 
of our Fusion Center, a cross-
functional security intelligence 
department that serves as a hub 
for all of our cyber and physical 
security defenses.  
 Over the course of the year, 
we optimized our performance 
to improve response time and 
effectiveness during global events, 
natural disasters, and service and 
security incidents. The Fusion 
Center’s Crisis Management team 
managed identified incidents, 
and by optimizing the Mastercard 
Intelligence Center’s intelligence 
feeds and sources, the Fusion 
Center has significantly reduced 
analysis time, allowing us to act 
proactively rather than reactively, 
make better business decisions 
and more rapidly achieve closure 
of these crisis events.
 We also established a 
partnership with the National 
Cyber Security Centre and other 
intelligence groups in London to 
prevent cash-out attacks  
on ATMs.Our efforts in securing Mastercard
We protect our network against 
security threats and also offer a 
range of security products and 
services designed to prevent 
and detect cyberattacks and 
fraud and to protect the security, 
confidentiality and integrity of  
our account holders’ and 
customers’ information.
 Our security program is 
regularly audited. Several U.S. 
and international government 
agencies conducted detailed on-
site assessments of our network 
security efforts. We also hosted 
numerous on-site and remote 
customer assessments and 
penetration tests. We have created a multilayered 
security strategy  to respond to 
attacks on our corporate and 
payment networks through a 
number of efforts improving  
our core security programs.Safety and 
security solutions
In an increasingly complex 
security landscape, Mastercard 
puts safety first.
 We are continually developing 
new and better technologies to 
protect payments while ensuring  
a seamless consumer experience.
We also help our stakeholders 
anticipate, mitigate and prevent 
threats of ever-greater frequency, 
scale, severity and sophistication.
 Developing industry-leading 
standards to ensure the safety 
of Mastercard transactions is 
one part of our multilayered 
security strategy, which also 
involves protecting infrastructure, 
devices and data, helping banks 
and merchants identify genuine 
consumers and stop fraud, 
and applying cutting-edge 
technologies such as artificial 
intelligence and biometric and 
digital authentication to continue 
to protect payments around  
the world. The methodology for these 
assessments — and our annual 
certifications — incorporates 
multiple industry-recognized 
frameworks, including those of 
the U.S. National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), 
Special Publication (SP) 800-115 
Technical Guide to Information 
Security Testing and Assessment, 
Open Web Application Security 
Project (OWASP) methodology, 
Payment Card Industry (PCI)

face-to-face payments 
We are rapidly scaling up our 
EMV technology in the U.S. as 
a way to dramatically reduce 
fraud at the point of sale. By 
including this dynamic digital 
data in every transaction, we 
have reduced overall fraud levels 
in card transactions. Building 
on our 20 years of history in 
creating and maintaining the EMV 
standard, Mastercard is currently 
working to increase the use of 
contactless cards around the 
globe to even further reduce fraud 
while improving the consumer 
experience. Smart Cities and 
Transit use cases have formed 
the basis for change in consumer 
behavior and mass adoption 
of contactless functionality. 
The deployment of contactless 
functionality in London, through 
Transport for London, helped in 
reaching the “tipping point” in 
the U.K.; similarly, Mastercard 
expects to emulate this success 
in the U.S. by offering contactless 
functionality on New York City’s 
MTA and other transit systems in 
American cities.Some of our 
leading solutions
Tokenization
We created our tokenization 
platform — the Mastercard Digital 
Enablement Services (MDES) — in 
2013 to leverage tokenization and 
bring the same comprehensive 
level of cryptographic protection 
to digital transactions that our 
EMV chip devices bring to in-
store transactions. MDES has 
continued its rapid growth: We 
conducted 1.3 billion transactions 
through MDES by expanding our 
tokenization services to a total of 
1,706 issuers in 60 markets.
 Mastercard launched MDES 
for Merchants, which uses 
tokens and cryptographic data 
to free merchants of the need 
to store sensitive account details 
while also keeping consumers’ 
payment information safe and 
up-to-date, even if their account 
details change. This advance 
is making online payments 
more convenient and reducing 
declined transactions. MDES for 
Merchants has already accounted 
for more than 45 million payment 
authorizations since launch.EMVCo  
Secure Remote Commerce
Mastercard participated in the 
creation of the new EMVCo 
Secure Remote Commerce 
(SRC) standards, which will 
secure, streamline and scale 
e-commerce checkouts. 
Comparable to a single point-

87Safety Net
Safety Net helps limit the 
financial, reputational and 
business impact of large-scale 
fraud attacks by leveraging 
Mastercard’s global network  
via a turnkey solution.
 For issuers, Safety Net 
provides network-level transaction 
monitoring that identifies and 
limits the impact of cyberattacks 
when issuer or processor systems 
are breached. Safety Net provides 
an external layer of defense — 
independent from customer 
systems — with selective online 
authorization controls that block 
transactions according to multiple 
criteria. 
 Safety Net operates in a 
passive state until a situation 
becomes critical, providing 
gradually escalated responses 
to detected threats that allow 
customers to control their fraud 
strategies and minimize any 
impact to consumer acceptance. For acquirers, Safety Net 
provides specific monitoring 
criteria and rules designed to 
evaluate transactions from an 
acquirer perspective — analyzing 
overall activity for a specific 
acquirer and/or cardholder 
across multiple ATMs, merchants, 
countries and more to determine 
if a merchant is the target of a 
large-scale attack.
 Designed to protect merchants 
from large-scale cyberattacks and 
fraud events, Safety Net monitors 
transactions at the global 
network level, employing artificial 
intelligence to continuously 
monitor more than 200 million 
transactions a day. By identifying 
and isolating systematic threats 
within milliseconds, Safety Net 
intelligently declines fraudulent 
transactions on behalf of an 
issuer within minutes. Since its 
introduction, Safety Net has  
saved banks millions of dollars  
in potential fraud.Decision Intelligence
One of the key challenges in 
payments fraud, especially in the 
digital channel, is distinguishing 
between genuine and fraudulent 
transactions rapidly, accurately 
and with minimal friction for  
the consumer.
 Mastercard’s Decision 
Intelligence platform uses artificial 
intelligence to analyze insights 
from our network to improve 
consumers’ shopping experiences, 
increase transaction approval 
rates, minimize fraud for retailers 
and prevent banks from losing 
money. Decision Intelligence is a 
real-time authorization-decisioning 
solution that applies thousands 
of data points and sophisticated 
modeling techniques to each 
transaction, simplifying these 
insights into a single transaction-
decision score that helps issuers 
fine-tune their authorization 
decisions in order to approve more 
genuine transactions without 
increasing risk.For each transaction, Decision 
Intelligence assesses:
• Transaction security  based on 
widespread fraud monitoring, 
fraud rules, transaction fraud 
models and profiles — does the 
purchase fit the consumer’s 
transaction behavior?
• Consumer transaction 
attributes  based on consumer 
account and device information  
— are the card, device, IP address 
and other attributes valid?
• Consumer segmentation 
based on insights into account 
spending that help define the 
value and engagement of the 
consumer with their issuer  
— how valuable is the consumer?
88NuData Solutions
In March 2017 , Mastercard 
acquired NuData and its passive 
biometrics and behavioral 
analytics capabilities. The solution 
distinguishes authentic users 
from potential fraudsters, based 
on their online, mobile app and 
smartphone interactions. These 
device-level insights enable 
merchants and issuers to improve 
their authorization decisions. We 
have been integrating NuData’s 
tools into Mastercard’s robust 
suite of fraud-management 
and security products. In 2018, 
we monitored 400 billion events 
worldwide, 28% of which we 
identified as high-risk and flagged 
to the merchant involved. In 
addition, we analyzed global login 
data to reveal that 49% of all login 
attempts are fraudulent.
Early detection  
In order to give issuers advanced 
alerts about potential fraud, 
we partner with specialist data 
providers that scan Dark Web 
marketplaces for information and 
combine that data with predictive 
technologies to stop fraud before 
it starts. This solution accelerates 
detection by six months to nine 
months ahead of a confirmed 
account-data-compromised alert.As part of our continuing  
efforts to stay ahead of the ever- 
changing threat environment, 
Mastercard unveiled a number  
of security innovations:
EMV 3DS 2.0 
EMV 3-D SECURE (3DS2) is the 
new industry standard defined 
by EMVCo to help merchants and 
issuers authenticate card-not-
present transactions. The 3DS2 
transaction protocol addresses 
changes to the digital landscape 
and represents a continued 
effort to improve security and 
the cardholder experience by 
harnessing the rich data provided 
by digital commerce. As we 
introduce 3DS2 around the global, 
consumers and merchants alike 
will benefit from stronger two-
factor authentication and broader 
support for payment channels 
within apps, in browsers and 
through the “internet of things.” Security 
developments
Threat Scan
This payments-specific solution 
intelligently assesses issuer 
authorization processes for 
vulnerabilities. Threat Scan offers 
issuers a self-service solution to 
test their authorization-process 
configurations by simulating 
external threats, and we have 
developed the tool to test against 
a number of known criminal 
attack vectors that manipulate 
authorization data to breach 
security systems.
Biometric Card
The Biometric Card adds security 
to each in-person transaction and 
provides the best user experience 
to the consumer. Users can add 
the biometric authentication 
feature to any existing Mastercard 
product, from the Standard card 
to the World Elite. The biometric 
card offers a variety of advanced 
capabilities to cardholders: • Captures and matches 
biometric fingerprint image on 
the card
• Utilizes biometric (fingerprint) as 
an alternative to PIN/signature 
at EMV POS terminals
• Works with current merchant 
POS terminals to eliminate the 
need for hardware or software 
upgrades 
• Secures biometric data — 
ensuring that no data leaves 
the card and that the data is 
not shared with merchants
• Offers a simple, at-home 
enrollment process that 
proceeds in two minutes, 
without issuer intervention; and
• Relies on PIN/signature 
authentication in case biometric 
fails or cannot be attempted.Process data and

Mastercard provides equal 
employment opportunities and 
treats all employees fairly and 
equally and without regard 
to any protected distinction 
such as age, gender (including 
gender identity), marital 
status, civil partnership status, 
sexual preference, disability, 
color, nationality, race or ethnic

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
We extend our culture  
of decency and respect  
for all people across our 
operations. Everywhere  
we work, spanning our  
global workforce, we  
remain steadfastly 
committed to treating  
all people fairly and  
with dignity. As part of the Responsible 
Sourcing Program’s mission, 
we are shifting our supplier 
relationships from a transactional 
approach to one built on 
developing deep engagement 
around our shared values. In 
addition to working with more 
than 250 of our suppliers to 
help them manage, report 
and reduce their emissions, 
we are empowering our small 
and diverse-owned suppliers 
by providing resources and 
educational opportunities about 
financial literacy, sustainability  
and capacity-building.
 In 2019, Mastercard increased 
our commitment to responsible 
sourcing by hiring a Responsible 
Sourcing and Supplier Diversity 
Lead, who will help us develop 
our formal program, including 
respect for ethics and human 
rights, supplier diversity and 
environmental sustainability.
 More information about how 
our Responsible Sourcing Program 
engages with suppliers to 
decrease our Scope 3 greenhouse 
gas emissions is available in the 
Environmental Stewardship 
section on page 66 .
90“ We’re committed 
to driving and 
fostering social 
and environmental 
sustainability 
throughout our 
supply base. With 
that said, our 
expectations are 
growing; it’s no 
longer just about 
high-quality and 
cost-efficient 
solutions anymore.  
We want to do 
business with 
companies that  
share our values.”
 
 Bryan Fuller,  
 executive vice president of supply chain  
 and corporate services, MastercardWE REQUIRE 
EVERY SUPPLIER 
WE WORK WITH 
TO ABIDE BY 
LABOR LAWS,  
OPERATE IN LINE 
WITH GLOBAL 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
PRINCIPLES 
AND AVOID ALL 
USE OF FORCED 
LABORGuided by our Supplier Code of 
Conduct, Mastercard requires 
every supplier we work with to 
abide by labor laws, operate 
in line with globally recognized 
human rights principles and 
avoid all use of forced labor, 
whether prison labor, indentured 
labor, bonded labor or otherwise.  
Although we expect each 
supplier to define its own human 
rights policy and approach, 
we require it to be consistent 
with both our Supplier Code of 
Conduct  and the UN Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights.
 In addition, our Supplier 
Code of Conduct details our 
expectations and requirements 
around child labor, freedom of 
association, compensation and 
working hours and conditions, 
discrimination, health and safety, 
and much more.Ethics and 
human rights In accordance with the U.K. 
Modern Slavery Act, we have 
issued a statement outlining the 
steps Mastercard takes to ensure 
that no slavery takes place in our 
business or supply chains. We 
proudly endorse the principles of 
the Act; they mirror our stance as 
an ethical company that believes 
in doing well by doing good. Our 
full statement on modern slavery 
and human trafficking  details the 
policies and provisions we have 
implemented to eradicate modern 
slavery from our operations and 
supply chain.Mastercard ranked No. 4 on 
DiversityInc’s global list of the  
Top 50 Companies for Diversity, 
which includes recognition of our 
focus on minority- and women-
owned suppliers.Just as we value the unique 
contributions and perspectives 
of our global workforce, 
Mastercard strives to spread 
inclusion and diversity 
throughout our supply chain. 
Through our Supplier Diversity 
program, we actively seek to 
build and maintain business 
relationships with diverse and 
small businesses — suppliers 
that reflect our global operating 
environment, help enrich and 
strengthen the communities 
where we work, and provide us 
with high-quality, innovative 
products and services.
 We define diverse suppliers 
as companies that are majority-
owned, -operated and -controlled 
by one or more U.S. citizens who 
identify as an ethnic minority, 
woman, veteran, LGBT+ or as a 
person with a disability. In our 
efforts around supplier diversity, 
we also include small businesses 
that are certified by, and eligible 
for, assistance from the U.S. Small 
Business Administration. We are 
hosting Supplier Diversity Days 
at some of our U.S. and U.K. 
locations to educate companies 
about winning business, diversity 
in the workplace and more. Supplier diversity
 Mastercard spent more with 
U.S.-based diverse suppliers than 
we ever did previously in a single 
year; our Tier 1 and Tier 2  spend 
with diverse suppliers represent ed 
more than 10% of our total 
U.S.-based spend. To further 
increase our impact, we are 
working to educate our suppliers 
about the importance of having 
a supplier diversity program of 
their own.
 In early 2019, we launched 
a new partnership with 
WEConnect International, a 
global network that connects 
women-owned businesses with 
qualified buyers around the 
world, to determine the most 
effective strategy to increase our 
global spend with female-owned 
businesses. We are prioritizing 
our efforts to empower women-
owned businesses as part of our 
investment in our economy and 
our communities.
91“  Mastercard’s commitment to doing 
well by doing good reminds us that 
when the world thrives, businesses 
thrive. This report reflects what 
we do at Mastercard – we aim 
to benefit people, partners, 
shareholders and consumers alike 
through commercially sustainable 
social impact. We’re on a journey 
and I’m excited to see how much 
further we can go and the impact 
we can make for ourselves, our 
communities and the world.”
