Doing well  
by doing good
Corporate Sustainability Report 2019The world we’re standing in today looks 
very different than it did a year ago. The 
COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives and 
livelihoods and shown us very clearly how 
deeply interconnected our world has become 
— in ways that go far beyond our politics, 
our cultures and our supply chains. And the 
race tensions in the United States, echoed by 
protests against all kinds of racial injustices 
around the world, underscore just how much 
more work we have to do.
These converging crises lay bare three 
challenges we are confronted with: the 
tensions between humanity and nature  
(i.e., the environment), the distinction 
between one and many (i.e., inclusion),  
and the balance between the short-term  
and the long-term (i.e., how we manage  
our businesses, communities and more  
for success and social impact). 
How we resolve these challenges will 
determine how we make Environmental, 
Social, Governance (ESG) central to our 
business model. We seek to integrate 
environmental considerations not just into 
our practices, but to offer consumers the 
opportunity to do so, too. We seek to pursue 
commercially sustainable social impact 
that can deliver short-term gains while also 
building longer-term systems that help set 
everyone up for success. And all of that 
means we have to organize ourselves around 
sound and ethical business practices that are 
guided by clear and sustainable purposes.Earlier this year, Mastercard introduced 
a new purpose statement: Connecting 
Everyone to Priceless Possibilities. It’s a 
statement that speaks to how we run our 
company. We set our workforce up for 
success first — through culture, inclusion, 
development and opportunity — so that 
they can set our business up for success in 
the long run. It is our people’s decency, their 
diversity and their commitment to doing  
well by doing good that make it possible for 
us to keep delivering on our commitments to 
enable commerce, to drive financial inclusion, 
to give back to the environment and to 
maintain a strong business model over the 
long term. Putting our hand at their backs 
gives us all a boost.
While the words of our purpose statement 
are new, the spirit is not. Our people use our 
technology, resources and capabilities to drive 
financial inclusion — because bringing more 
people into the digital economy strengthens 
the system, empowers its users and leads to 
inclusive growth. That’s why we’re doubling 
down on our original financial inclusion 
commitment to bring a total of 1 billion 
people into the financial system by 2025. We 
are committed to bringing 50 million micro 
and small businesses into the digital economy 
and to helping 25 million women-owned  
and -run businesses with the tools they need 
to succeed and grow — part of our ongoing 
efforts to help small businesses get through 
this crisis and continue to drive job creation 
and inclusive growth.The statement also speaks to how we look 
at our responsibility to the environment. 
The quality and nature of our own future 
are deeply and inextricably linked to the 
health and well-being of our planet. If 
we want to keep growing and thriving 
as individuals, corporations or countries, 
we have to do better. That’s why we’re 
accelerating our plan to improve our 
environmental footprint and putting 
the power of our network of partners —
consumers included — behind a “Priceless 
Planet Coalition”. The coalition is designed 
to take collective action against climate 
change, including educating, incentivizing 
and inspiring consumers to participate in 
carbon footprint-reducing behaviors and 
contribute to tree-planting efforts.
We are all in this crisis together, but we 
have a choice as to how we come out of it: 
We can put things back the way they were 
before, or we can work together to rebuild 
a better, stronger, more resilient and more 
inclusive digital economy, one that benefits 
everyone, everywhere. 
Ajay Banga  
CEO, Mastercard“ If we want to keep growing and thriving — as individuals, 
corporations or countries — we have to do better.“

financial institutionWe are a multi-rail network that 
offers customers one partner to 
turn to for their domestic and cross-
border payment needs.
 Through our distinctive and 
proprietary global payment network, 
which we refer to as our core network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) 
payment transactions and provide 
related products and services. We 
have additional payment capabilities 
that include automated clearing house 
(ACH) transactions (both batch and 
real-time account-based payments). Mastercard’s franchise creates  
and sustains a comprehensive  
series of value exchanges across  
our ecosystem, where each 
participant benefits directly or 
indirectly from the involvement  
and actions of other participants.
 These value exchanges are 
managed and held in tension by  
the franchise function to ensure a 
balanced ecosystem where all 
participants benefit from safety and  
security on our standardized rails — 
and yet still retain the ability to 
independently differentiate against 
their competition. We achieve this 
through the following key activities:
Participant onboarding   
Defining what the ecosystem roles 
are and what responsibilities each 
ecosystem participant has, and 
ensuring that participants meet  
the necessary prerequisites to  
partake in the network.
Safety and security   
Establishing the core principles  
that are essential to the experience  
of our network participants,  
including ensuring consumer 
protections and integrity, so 
participants feel confident to  
transact on the network.Our core business
Operating standards  
Defining the operational, technical  
and financial policies to which the 
network participants are required  
to adhere. Identifying changes in  
the ecosystem and emerging roles  
that require definition with the  
aim of achieving efficiency, quality 
output and uniformity of  
performance, while reducing 
miscommunication and failure to 
comply with industry regulations.
Responsible stewardship  
Establishing performance standards 
to support ecosystem growth and 
optimization by setting key objectives 
and targets for participants so the 
quality of the ecosystem improves  
over time. Establishing proactive 
monitoring to ensure participants 
are adhering to operating standards, 
and overseeing actions that will be 
taken to protect the ecosystem where 
standards are not met.
Issue resolution  
Operating a framework to enable 
global network participants to  
resolve a grievance, which might  
be financial or nonfinancial, in order  
to come to a resolution in a timely  
and orderly fashion.Franchise

About MastercardProvenance
As cross-border trade continues  
to grow with technological 
innovation and the globalization  
of commerce, companies are 
managing complex supply chains 
that are highly fragmented. In 
parallel, more conscious consumers 
are making purchasing decisions 
aligned with their beliefs and with 
a focus on quality and authenticity, 
but they don’t know the story 
behind the products.
 Mastercard’s Provenance Solution 
addresses this demand by enabling 
visibility into a product’s journey 
from origin to end consumer. In 2019, 
using our permissioned provenance 
solution on blockchain, we helped large 
food retailers trace the journey and 
highlight the origin of their seafood 
supply, providing transparency into 
ethical sourcing and the environmental 
compliance of providers of seafood 
sold at their stores.
 With increased transparency, our 
scalable provenance solution enables 
our partners to bolster trust in supply 
chains and improve reconciliation 
processes between parties, while  
also limiting counterfeit trade, 
encouraging regulatory compliance, 
promoting sustainability and building 
consumer confidence.Lab for Financial Inclusion
In 2019, we estimate that over  
1.7 billion people lacked access to 
basic financial tools and services.1
 Providing financial services 
and security to these underserved 
individuals is critical in helping lift 
people out of poverty and putting 
them on a path toward prosperity. 
The Nairobi-based Mastercard Lab for 
Financial Inclusion’s sole mission is to 
address this urgent need. By bringing 
together Mastercard’s innovation 
and financial inclusion expertise with 
local insight and strategic partners, 
the Lab launches solutions that help 
individuals manage risk better, plan 
their financial future and empower 
their economic potential. Three key solutions include: 
Mastercard Farmer Network (MFN) 
in agriculture; Kionect in micro-
retail; and Kupaa in education. By 
the end of 2019, the Mastercard 
Farmer Network, which digitizes 
marketplaces, payments and other 
transactions for farmers in Tanzania 
and Uganda, had over 475,000 
farmers registered. Similarly, Kupaa, 
our education platform designed 
to eliminate school payment 
inefficiencies, was adopted by more 
than 500 schools in Uganda during 
2019, representing a 67% increase 
from 2018. For more information,

About MastercardSUSTAINABILITY  
AT MASTERCARD
We recognize that we cannot 
succeed in a failing world. That’s 
why we’ve set bold new targets to 
address issues the world is facing.
 However, we know that these 
issues are bigger than any one 
company — sustainability requires a 
network of reach and partnerships. 
We are leveraging and activating 
the power of our network to make 
real, sustainable change for our 
company, society and planet.Sustainability at 
Mastercard is at  
the core of our  
business strategy;  
it’s an imperative 
stated in our  
purpose.At Mastercard, we welcome the 
views of diverse stakeholders, 
both internal and external, as 
key partners in identifying 
the environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) issues that  
affect our business most  
materially and where we can  
make the biggest impacts. 
 Every few years, we conduct a 
formal assessment that captures 
the views from internal and 
external stakeholders on ESG 
topics. This formal stakeholder 
engagement ensures that we  
are prioritizing key areas of 
impact that are important to  
our external stakeholders and  
our long-term business success. 
 Our latest assessment was 
conducted in partnership with 
a global nonprofit, Business 
for Social Responsibility (BSR), 
in 2016. The assessment 
incorporated the research 
and guidance provided by the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
and Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB). Each year since, we have reviewed 
and refreshed the results as needed. 
Informed by this assessment, as well 
as by our ongoing engagement with 
stakeholders, the following ESG 
matters were identified as our top 
material issues as they relate to the 
importance of sustainability and the 
influence on our business success.
• Consumer financial literacy
• Ethical business practices
• Inclusion and diversity
• Inclusive growth
• New technologies
• Privacy and data protection
• Responsible use of data

About MastercardSustainability at Mastercard  
is driven from the top by our  
Board of Directors and CEO,  
and it is embedded in every  
level of our company.
 Because sustainability is part 
of our strategic thinking, the full 
Board oversees certain sustainability 
matters (e.g., financial inclusion, 
privacy) directly as part of both 
regular market reviews of geographic 
areas and strategic reviews of 
strategic growth, products and 
innovation, enterprise partnerships, 
and data and services. The Board also 
reviews talent matters annually.
 All three Board committees 
also oversee discrete sustainability 
matters from a strategic and  
risk-management perspective.  
In particular, the Human Resources 
and Compensation Committee 
(HRCC) discusses people and  
culture regularly. The Audit Committee discusses ethics 
and compliance and receives regular 
reporting regarding business risks and 
opportunities, some of which addresses 
sustainability issues such as data 
privacy. The Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee considers 
sustainability matters more generally, 
including overseeing the development 
of a human rights framework, and 
overseeing the management of our 
social impact and our environmental 
stewardship programs.
 Our senior management works 
together to advance our global 
sustainability efforts across the 
organization. Our Chief Sustainability 
Officer (CSO) is tasked with integrating 
sustainability initiatives across business 
units and leveraging them as enterprise-
wide drivers of growth. The CSO reports 
to the Vice Chairman and President of 
Strategic Growth, who reports directly 
to the CEO. Both the President of 
Strategic Growth and the CSO report 
regularly to the Board and the relevant 
committees on sustainability matters. Sustainability

About MastercardINCLUSIVE  
GROWTH02
Mastercard has become a leader in financial 
inclusion and inclusive growth over the past 
decade. Our journey began because we saw 
the social and economic implications of being 
excluded and the hidden cost of cash on 
people, communities and businesses at the 
base of the pyramid.OUR APPROACH
25We have launched innovative 
programs across more than 125 
countries, successfully bringing 
500 million previously unbanked 
individuals into the formal economy. 
 More than ever, it is clear that 
growth can be sustainable only when 
it is inclusive, where the benefits 
of a growing economy accrue to all 
segments, leading to broadly shared 
prosperity, and the burdens of a 
contracting economy are not unfairly 
borne by the most vulnerable. Long 
before the COVID-19 pandemic, 
we were on a mission to make the 
digital economy work for everyone, 
everywhere. Our goal is to help 
individuals, families, businesses, NGOs 
and governments leverage new 
technologies to unlock their potential. 
That mission has become even more 
critical in light of the pandemic, which 
has accelerated the trend toward 
digitized economies and underscored 
the importance of ensuring that 
everyone benefits from the shift. At Mastercard, we are applying 
the expertise of our 18,600 team 
members and leveraging our research, 
philanthropic capital, technology, data 
insights and partnerships to build a 
more inclusive global digital economy. 
We are focused on connecting people 
and businesses to achieve financial 
security, providing workers with the 
tools they need to thrive in a rapidly 
changing landscape, ensuring that 
economic development is inclusive,  
and building up the field of data 
science for social impact.
 We are leveraging our trusted 
network to build partnerships and 
programs that increase access to 
education, health care, supply chains, 
commerce, and more. Our  collaborators 
include governments and multilateral 
development and financial institutions, 
nonprofit organizations, universities, 
think tanks and our colleagues across 
the private sector. We all thrive 
in growing, inclusive and healthy 
economies. By driving commercially 
sustainable social impact, we can 
demonstrate what it means when we 
say we are “doing well by doing good” 
— by doing what we do best!We are committed to bringing 1 billion  
people into the digital economy by 2025,  
by creating pathways toward increased  
financial security for people, communities  
and businesses around the world.

Inclusive GrowthThe Center for Inclusive Growth  
(“the Center”)  is the philanthropic 
hub of Mastercard. It focuses on 
promoting equitable and sustainable 
economic growth and financial 
inclusion around the world, as well as 
administering the Mastercard Impact 
Fund’s philanthropic investments. 
 The Center leverages the company’s 
expertise, data analytics, technology 
and partnerships to produce 
independent research, scale global 
programs and empower a community 
of thinkers, leaders and doers on the 
front lines of inclusive growth. In 2019, 
the Center expanded its economic 
development efforts by establishing 
new partnerships and creating tools 
that give policymakers and community 
leaders actionable insights so they 
can build inclusive economies, locally 
and regionally. Two of the major 
partnerships launched in 2019 are the 
Rockefeller Foundation partnership 
data.org, to catalyze the use of data 
science for social impact, and our 
multiyear Global Inclusive Growth 
Partnership with the Aspen Institute, 
to mobilize leaders across sectors to 
promote integrated strategies for 
inclusive growth. In 2018, Mastercard decided to 
dedicate $500 million of the savings 
generated by U.S. and European  
tax reforms to inclusive growth,  
so we created the Mastercard  
Impact Fund. 
 As of Dec. 31, 2019, the Mastercard 
Impact Fund had committed $93.5 
million. For example, in 2019, the Fund 
supported CARE USA with a $5.26 
million multiyear grant to equip nearly  
four million micro and small businesses  
in Pakistan, Peru and Vietnam with 
tools, training, education, products  
and services to help them formalize  
and grow.  To date, the Center for Inclusive 
Growth has collaborated with 55 
research organizations and fellows and 
invested in programs reaching more 
than 1.5 million people in 30 countries. Mastercard

Growth Summit 
Mastercard’s Center for Inclusive Growth  
joined the Aspen Institute in October 2019 
to co-host the first Global Inclusive Growth 
Summit.  The objective was to advance 
inclusive economic growth around the world 
by assembling a community of purpose-
driven leaders from across sectors to 
catalyze partnerships and shine a spotlight 
on innovative, data-driven, scalable and 
commercially sustainable solutions.
 The Summit forged connections to drive 
solutions for some of the world’s most  
intractable problems, raising the bar for how  
we engage with stakeholders to inspire action.  
 More than 500 people attended the Summit — 
followed by over 30,000 video views — to hear 50 
global leaders from government, nonprofits and 
the private sector.
 Eight major funding commitments totaling 
$72 million were announced to support inclusive 
growth programs, including Mastercard’s own 
pledge of $26 million toward the creation of 
the Aspen Partnership for an Inclusive Economy 
(APIE). That partnership will combine the ideas, 
talents and resources of the public, private and 
nonprofit sectors to address income inequality 
and opportunity through the lens of inclusive 
growth. APIE will lead to the development of 
bold new proposals from experts across Aspen 
Institute programs and networks; the mobilization 
of leaders across sectors to advance integrated 
strategies for inclusive growth; and the convening 
of thought leaders and change-makers to drive 
solutions and impact. The Center will serve as 
a partner of APIE and leverage the assets of 
Mastercard — people, data insights, technology 
and a global network — to ensure that the digital 
economy works for everyone, everywhere.

Inclusive GrowthThe Nairobi-based Mastercard 
Lab for Financial Inclusion created 
groundbreaking solutions to help 
individuals and micro and small- 
businesses achieve increased  
financial security. 
 The Lab brings together  
Mastercard’s innovation and global  
financial inclusion capabilities,  
combining these with local expertise  
and insight to deliver inclusive growth  
and empower people. Three solutions  
developed by this team — Mastercard  
Farmer Network, Kupaa and Kionect — 
have successfully transitioned from  
the Nairobi Lab to Mastercard business  
units and are being deployed across  
several countries.The Mastercard Foundation is one 
of the largest foundations in the 
world. Through its Young Africa 
Works strategy and Canadian EleV 
program, the Foundation works with 
partners to ensure young people, 
especially young women, have access 
to a quality education, financial 
services and dignified work.
 The Foundation was established in 
2006 through a designated allocation 
of stock when Mastercard became 
a public company. The Foundation is 
independent, with its own board of 
directors and CEO. Its assets have 
grown and its programs have helped 
improve the lives of 44 million people 
living in poverty. Key 2019 accomplishments include:
• Implemented its new Young Africa 
Works country-focused strategies 
in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, 
Senegal and Uganda to help 30 
million young people have dignified 
and fulfilling work by 2030.  
• Established four regional hubs — in 
Accra, Ghana; Nairobi, Kenya; Kigali, 
Rwanda; and Toronto, Canada — to 
ensure the heart of the Foundation  
is in the countries where we work.  
• Expanded the Scholars Program 
at the tertiary level to advance 
transformative leadership and youth 
transitions in support of socio-
economic transformation in Africa. 
Fifteen thousand young people will be 
added to the Program with a focus 
on excluded populations, including 
refugees and displaced youth, people 
with disabilities and women.  Mastercard Lab for

Farming
Most coffee farmers in Mexico 
are smallholders cultivating 1 to 3 
hectares of land, often in remote 
locations, making them dependent 
on middlemen to sell their coffee, 
which means they lose a substantial 
amount of their income in fees.
 Under Mastercard’s partnership 
with the Neumann Kaffee Gruppe 
(NKG) and its Mexican subsidiary, 
Exportadora de Café California (ECC), 
an innovative electronic payments 
solution has been implemented that 
allows farmers to get paid directly by 
NKG. This means farmers get paid in 
a faster, safer and more convenient 
way that allows them to keep more of 
their earnings. The payment solution 
is complemented by also enabling local 
merchants to accept digital payments.
 As of May 2020, more than 1,200 
farmers were enabled by our digital 
payment solution. This scalable, speedy 
and cost-efficient system also lowered 
processing costs, allowing NKG to 
reach even more farmers directly. 
We’re continuing to innovate and 
expand the program.Commerce
Kionect is a multi-sided supply chain 
platform that enables the growth 
of underbanked small merchants 
by efficiently linking them digitally 
to their suppliers and to financial 
service providers, allowing them 
to access credit and participate in 
supply chain finance. The platform 
was launched in Egypt in 2019. Around the globe, 70% of adults  
in low-income countries who work  
in the private sector receive their 
wages in cash.  
 Mastercard, alongside industry 
partners including Levi Strauss & 
Co. and Marks & Spencer, is helping 
garment factory workers to get paid 
digitally and build their savings safely.
 At the same time, we’re providing 
more transparency, streamlining 
operations and increasing efficiencies 
for these brands’ factories. The first 
pilot is underway in Egypt. At the end  
of 2019, over 3,800 factory workers  
had bank accounts and over 280 had 
opened digital wallets.
 As part of this effort, the Mastercard 
Center for Inclusive Growth partnered 
with global nonprofit BSR to offer 
financial-literacy training to workers 
and to adapt its successful HERfinance 
program to these markets. The 
HERfinance program helps low-income 
workers better manage their incomes 
and brings them into the formal 
financial system through education 
programs on financial literacy and 
availability of digitized wage payments. 
Ultimately, we plan to replicate and 
scale this approach in other countries 
and other areas of manufacturing. Coffee farmer Elia Velázquez 
Domínguez, from Mexico’s Sierra 
Madre de Chiapas mountains,  
saw immediate benefits after 
switching to a digital supply chain. 
She now has instant access to all  
her earnings, including the 20% of 
her earnings that previously went  
to cash-based middlemen. FINANCIAL SECURITY
Mastercard spent 
years developing 
a combination of 
programs to help 
individuals access 
financial tools —  
and the education  
to use them  
properly — to achieve 
financial security.
Our mix of digital products and 
services ensures timely payments 
for completed work, allows for 
the accrual of savings, provides a 
way to tap into credit and makes it 
easier to deliver essential services 
to underserved communities. 
 We’re working to improve the lives 
of marginalized groups by connecting 
them to priceless possibilities so they 
can reach their potential.

Inclusive GrowthCommunity Pass is a suite of digital 
tools connecting people simply and 
securely to the vital services they 
need over a safe data platform.
 It creates digital “rails” that 
governments, civil society and the 
private sector can use to deliver 
necessary products and services.  
They also reduce the costs and improve 
the efficiency of delivering those 
services, encouraging and enabling 
investment by development and 
humanitarian organizations.Enabling access

Inclusive Identity  is a biometric-
based authentication ecosystem 
that allows people to prove their 
identities, even without any formal 
documentation such as a birth 
certificate. 
 This low-infrastructure solution 
offers frictionless enrollment and 
authentication. We’ve made it inter-
operable and open-standards-based 
to ensure it can operate as a global 
franchise model.Mastercard Aid Network  is a digital 
voucher system that has been used 
by aid agencies in Yemen, Niger  
and Mali. 
 It works by giving aid recipients  
a chip-enabled card that is periodically 
loaded with value so they can get 
necessities from a pool of goods, even 
in environments with no or limited 
connectivity. Local merchants are 
provided with user-friendly tablets  
to accept the cards. This system is  
safe and easy to use, it’s globally 
accessible and it eliminates the  
need for multiple partners. It allows parents, schools and 
governments to make and track digital 
payments. It also digitizes collection 
and tracking of teacher attendance,  
so schools in marginalized communities 
can maintain real-time data. In 2019, 
we scaled it to a total of more than 
500 schools in Uganda, increasing the 
reach to more than 130,000 parents 
and guardians.

Kupaa is a mobile education payment 
platform created in partnership with 
UNICEF and Uganda’s Ministry of 
Education to help students stay on 
track and take their education to the 
next level.  Wellness Pass  is a platform for 
digitizing immunization records via 
a secure chip card developed by 
Mastercard and GAVI, the Global 
Alliance for Vaccine Innovation.  
 It’s an application that enables 
record portability and accurate 
treatment, even among offline health 
centers. It includes the activation of 
electronic notifications so service 
providers can help more children from 
the poorest countries stay on track 
to receive life-saving immunizations 
and helps governments assess the 
effectiveness of their programs to 
eradicate diseases.Community Commerce provides 
underbanked or unbanked individuals 
with a secure “bank account on a 
card” to receive and send funds or 
store cash, even without a mobile 
phone or internet access.
 We piloted Community Commerce 
in December 2018 in Mozambique in 
partnership with Banco Letshego, a 
subsidiary of the Letshego Group. As 
of June 2020, the pilot resulted with 
more than 100,000 consumers and 
500 merchants registered, and more 
than 87% of consumers deposited 
money onto their cards.
Mastercard Farmer Network  is a 
network that digitizes marketplaces, 
payments and transactions for 
farmers, giving smallholder farmers 
access to a digital marketplace. 
 It has been deployed in Tanzania, 
Uganda and India. By the end of 2019, 
more than 475,000 farmers had 
registered on the platform.

Inclusive Growth Ensuring shopkeepers are equipped 
with basic financial knowledge is 
instrumental to the program. The 
Mastercard Center for Inclusive 
Growth partnered with nonprofit 
TechnoServe to facilitate that 
education. It had in-person training  
for the micro merchants on topics such 
as financial management, responsible 
credit use, merchandising and other 
business operational skills. 
 To date, this training has reached 
more than 4,500 merchants, more 
than half are women. Shopkeepers 
reported an average increase in daily 
revenue of nearly 20%. We are using 
digital training models, including  
SMS-based platforms, to expand  
the training program. 
 Mastercard remains committed 
to scaling Jaza Duka and Kionect as 
part of its Mastercard Micro Credit 
Program with other consumer goods 
companies across several emerging 
markets. Mastercard wants to offer 
shopkeepers more choices among 
financial propositions, training 
programs and other benefits.Unlocking 
microcredit 
Jaza Duka 
Meaning “Fill up your store” in Swahili, 
Jaza Duka was created to give micro 
merchants in Kenya access to low-
interest Jaza Duka credit, allowing 
them to sell a wider range of products 
and grow their businesses. It launched 
in 2017 in partnership with Unilever 
and Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB).
 KCB offers shopkeepers digital credit 
and accounts and in return receives 
critical data on its purchases from 
suppliers to assess credit risk with 
improved accuracy. Unilever provides 
its products, thereby expanding its 
distribution and Mastercard’s network 
runs the transactions. Since its 
inception, 20,000 shopkeepers have 
registered with the program. In 2019, 
we expanded even further with two 
pilot programs. One is an insurance 
pilot, partnered with AXA and Unilever, 
the other a membership/rewards pilot, 
offering stores incentives to place Jaza 
Duka credit orders — and repay them  
in full and on time.Accion 
We are working to transform 
services for 8 million people, 3 million 
of whom are entrepreneurs, over four 
years with $15 million in grant funds 
for Accion  from the Mastercard 
Impact Fund. This grant supports 
the digitization of financial service 
providers around the world, enabling 
organizations to scale safely and to 
increase the number of people  
they serve.
 In 2019, the partnership with 
Accion reached more than 500,000 
micro, small and medium enterprises, 
working with eight fintech startups 
and six financial service providers 
(FSPs). The fintechs, two in the U.S. 
and six in emerging markets, are 
helping create a more inclusive digital 
ecosystem for micro merchants. 
The FSPs are engaged in activities 
as varied as creating a financial 
inclusion innovation hub, a digital bank 
within a microfinance institution, a 
marketplace platform for financial 
services and expanded outreach 
through digital lending. They include 
Accion Microfinance Bank in Nigeria, 
CÍVICO in Colombia and Mexico, BASIX

Inclusive GrowthFinancial literacy
Master Your Card
Financial literacy is an important 
component of financial security, 
so helping marginalized or 
underserved groups learn and 
understand how to manage money 
is a key component of Mastercard’s 
vision for inclusive growth. 
 Educational programs such as 
Master Your Card help build that 
solid foundation for people of color, 
seniors, women, youths and small- 
businesses. Our curriculum for small 
business owners explains the benefits 
of accepting electronic payments 
and other tools to help improve and 
protect their businesses. In 2019, the 
Master Your Card program engaged 
directly with more than 2,000 
individuals and entrepreneurs through 
many partner engagements and 
events in more than 10 U.S. markets. 
 There are various Master Your 
Card youth education initiatives, 
including a student-based program 
that provides financial literacy 
education in 200-plus schools in 
underserved communities. We 
worked in 2019 with high-need 
students in New York and St. Louis 
in conjunction with EVERFI Inc., 
the leading U.S. digital education 
company. The program has reached 
30,000-plus students since launching 
in 2016. Mastercard Academy
Mastercard Academy provides 
training on Mastercard’s products 
and services to customers, 
developing essential skills through  
three platforms — consisting of 
expert open seminars, on-demand 
courses and online training sessions.  
 Customers can choose to learn  
at a location of convenience, their  
own premises or remotely through  
our Academy on the Web (AOW) 
platform. In 2019, the Mastercard 
Academy educated over 45,000  
people about the payments industry 
and its technology.
Mastercard Academy 2.0 
Mastercard made a commitment  
to increasing worldwide financial  
and digital literacy. 
 Over the next three years,

Inclusive GrowthCity Possible
City KeyLaunched in 2018, City Possible is a 
partnership and co-creation initiative 
that brings cities, companies and 
communities together to identify 
common challenges and co-develop 
solutions that advance inclusive and 
sustainable urban development.
 In 2019, the network grew to more 
than 40 cities and made significant 
progress in helping cities make tech 
work for people — by streamlining 
public transit, increasing access to 
city services and informing urban 
planning to improve quality of life. 
By bringing together city leaders to 
surface shared challenges and connect 
them to the insights and solutions of 
academics, businesses and NGOs, City 
Possible is pioneering a path to making 
cities more inclusive and sustainable, 
drawing on the collective expertise and 
resources of all stakeholders.City Key helps economically 
disadvantaged people take the first 
steps toward financial security, while 
providing better and more efficient 
access to city services. 
 City Key can be programmed 
with many functions, including 
official identification, access to city 
services, disbursement of social 
benefits and subsidies and a way to 
transact digitally. A pilot of City Key 
was launched this year in San Jose, 
California. We’re taking insights from 
that pilot back to our partners to 
explore additional uses, including faster 
and more targeted distribution of 
social benefits and improved access to 
broadband and other digital services.
Our data analytics help those 
leaders, as well as businesses, 
nonprofits and NGOs, to assess 
and promote economic growth and 
make more-informed decisions. We are harnessing 
our technology, talent 
and data insights 
with a suite of 
innovative products

Inclusive GrowthThe Mastercard Center for Inclusive 
Growth introduced a suite of tools 
for community leaders in response 
to a growing demand for more 
evidence-based insights. These tools 
help steer impact investment dollars 
to locally led economic development 
initiatives and unlock the potential of 
underserved neighborhoods. 
 The Inclusive Growth Score is 
an interactive online map that, for 
the first time, provides a clear view 
of social and economic growth in 
underserved communities across the 
U.S. at the census-tract level. The 
initial design is focused on driving 
sustainable growth for the more than 
30 million people living in more than 
8,700 Qualified Opportunity Zones 
throughout the United States. 
 Our map is based on timely and 
highly granular economic and location 
data. It calculates an Inclusive Growth 
Score for each zone using both 
Mastercard insights and open-source 
data, taking into account not only 
economic activity, but also various 
social metrics. The higher the score, the 
more likely it is that growth is trending 
in a more inclusive direction.
As part of data.org, the Mastercard 
Impact Fund and the Rockefeller 
Foundation  pledged to help improve 
the health and economic mobility 
of at least 5 million people in five 
years through a jointly awarded $7.5 
million gift to Benefits Data Trust.   
 The Trust streamlines access to

Inclusive GrowthFUTURE OF WORKERS
Mastercard is 
working to give 
people the digital 
technology and 
tools needed to 
confidently navigate 
the changing 
nature of work and 
adapt to emerging 
opportunities. 
Technology creates new ways to 
start, grow and operate businesses, 
but it also displaces and unsettles 
many segments of the workforce, 
fueling a new economy of on-
demand work and posing challenges 
to traditional notions of the social 
safety net.Gig solutions 
Portable benefits We’re introducing solutions to make 
gig workers more financially secure — 
and their work more financially viable 
— by helping them track income and 
expenses, receive pay in real time  
and access small business benefits.  
 One example of this is a new 
Mastercard debit card that strengthens 
professional drivers’  economic security 
by giving them immediate access to 
their earnings, no-fee bank accounts 
and cash back on everyday purchases, 
designed in partnership with Lyft. 
As automation continues to change 
the employment landscape, we believe 
that access to skill-building, insurance 
protections, financial management 
tools and other benefits will be vital 
to helping vulnerable workers achieve 
financial security and stability.
 We know that to accomplish that 
goal, we must learn more about how 
workers access various benefits and find 
a way to help design a digital solution 
for portable benefits.

Inclusive GrowthWomen have a transformative 
impact on the financial landscape 
and the financial health of their 
communities. However, inequality 
and exclusion can hold women 
back, in part because much of our 
world was designed without women 
involved or in mind. 
 Mastercard is tackling this 
imbalance head-on, joining forces 
with our customers and organizations 
such as the Financial Alliance for 
Women to design better products, 
communications and experiences  
for women.
 As part of this focused effort, we 
have invested in global consumer 
research to better understand 
women’s financial needs, attitudes 
and behaviors across 18 markets. We 
also developed Women by Design, our 
proprietary framework for designing 
more inclusive financial solutions. 
Collaborating with our Labs as a 
Service team, we launched Women 
Sparks, a design thinking innovation 
workshop focused on working with  
our partners on women-centric 
concept development. Despite huge strides, women 
entrepreneurs continue to face a 
steeper climb than their male peers 
when it comes to accessing capital 
investment and other resources 
necessary to launch and grow  
their businesses.  
 Mastercard wants to help fix that. 
We’re pushing our networks further, 
forging ambitious partnerships and 
championing the people, businesses 
and innovations that are transforming 
the way our world works. 
 In the U.S., Mastercard has worked 
with the nonprofit microfinance 
organization Grameen America to 
support its technology transformation 
and to move low-income women 
into digital banking. Through this 
partnership, women can establish 
a financial identity and improve 
their businesses by digitizing their 
operations and accessing microloans. 
Digital payments enable Grameen to 
disburse same-day loans to women 
entrepreneurs in need, providing critical 
lifelines of support to their businesses. 
As of April 2020, Grameen America has 
disbursed over $1.5 billion to help more 
than 132,000 women entrepreneurs 
build or expand their businesses.   We’ve launched campaigns such as 
Her Ideas Start Something Priceless,  
which supports women entrepreneurs 
by connecting them with mentors, 
communities and other resources. We 
reaffirmed our commitment to women 
entrepreneurs in the U.S. by launching 
our Path to Priceless Initiative. Building 
on the success of Her Ideas, this 
initiative brings together partners like 
Create and Cultivate and Hello Alice to 
provide a network of support, learning 
resources and growth opportunities for 
women entrepreneurs.
 Our solutions give women control 
over their finances and protection 
for themselves and their families. 
The Mastercard Labs developed the 
Mastercard Farmer Network,  a digital 
platform accessible through a basic 
mobile phone that revolutionizes access 
to financial services by providing an easy 
way for women smallholder farmers 
to buy, sell and receive payments. More 
than 250,000 women smallholder 
farmers already are benefitting from it. 
 In April 2020, as part of our overall 
financial inclusion initiative, we extended 
our commitment by pledging to help 
25 million women-owned and/or -run 
businesses.  We’re connecting women to 
resources and solutions to improve their 
lives, because we believe that a world 
that works better for women creates 
limitless possibilities for us all.Our commitment

Inclusive GrowthDATA FOR GOOD
Mastercard is building the field of 
data science within the social sector 
so organizations have the tools and 
capabilities necessary to harness data 
science to improve lives.
We’re accelerating social impact 
through research, skill-building and 
the development of new technology 
platforms using data science and 
data governance. 
 In 2019, the Mastercard Impact 
Fund committed $25 million to the 
effort. Last year, we launched a Data 
Science for Social Impact (DSSI) 
collaborative with the Rockefeller 
Foundation  with a joint $50 million 
commitment over five years. That 
partnership, now being pursued as 
data.org, included a $20 million grant 
to DataKind , a global platform for 
social sector’s data science needs.  
 Data.org  is a platform designed 
to drive the development of the 
field of data science for social 
impact by forging partnerships and 
demonstrating the power of data 
as a tool for solving long-standing 
and seemingly intractable social 
problems. We’re also partnering 
with universities around the world 
to create a core curriculum on data 
science for social impact.

Inclusive GrowthData Fellows 
The Data Fellows program came 
out of Mastercard’s efforts to 
harness data insights for social good 
in collaboration with some of the 
world’s brightest minds. 
 The Fellows, data scientists from 
diverse academic and government 
institutions, collaborate with our data 
scientists to identify patterns, develop 
research papers and glean insights 
that drive economic growth for 
underserved segments of society.  
Last year’s inaugural class of Data 
Fellows delivered groundbreaking 
research demonstrating the power  
of data philanthropy to address  
social issues around inclusive growth. Mastercard put our insights to  
work in New Orleans, looking to  
see whether data could be used  
to determine the economic health  
of a community.
 The city needed hard data about 
the strengths of historically black 
neighborhoods to attract new 
investment and development. More 
than 60 Mastercard data scientists 
gathered in 2019 for a 36-hour 
“Datathon,”  joining forces with Michelle 
Thompson, a University of New 
Orleans professor and Mastercard 
data fellow who has been working with 
community leaders to develop insights 
to bolster investment. Mastercard data 
scientists identified trends in consumer 
spending and store openings that 
uncovered and validated enormous 
growth in two overlapping areas of 
New Orleans — the Claiborne Corridor 
Cultural Innovation District (CID) and 
the Livable Claiborne Corridor (LCC). The analysis is helping the 
community validate that neighborhood 
development efforts appear to be 
paying off — consumer spending and 
store openings in the area have risen 
sharply since those efforts began in 
2015, according to the results from 
the Datathon analysis. Between 
2015 and 2018, consumer spending 
growth at CID retail businesses was 
12 times greater when compared 
with Greater New Orleans. In the 
larger LCC, consumer spending grew 
by 16%. Community leaders say the 
insights can help them court new 
investments and make more-informed 
policy choices that lead to meaningful 
benefits for everyone in Claiborne.Helping New

We also support communities in need 
through charitable giving to organizations 
on the front lines helping people rebuild 
their lives in times of crisis and recovery.
Disaster relief
We take a team approach to disaster 
relief by channeling both corporate 
and employee donations to relief 
agencies. We also use Mastercard’s 
digital products, services, insights 
and employee volunteerism to 
support relief efforts.
 In 2019, we committed $545,000 
to support response and relief efforts 
for disasters around the world. We 
provided $250,000 to the American 
Red Cross for general disaster 
response coverage in the U.S., which 
included training initiatives in New 
York and St. Louis, where Mastercard 
employees serve as second responders. We gave another $200,000 to the 
Red Cross and $25,000 to Americares 
to fund disaster relief efforts in the 
Bahamas in the wake of Hurricane 
Dorian. We also hosted an employee 
volunteer effort to pack medical 
supplies for people in need. 
 In early 2020, we committed  
AU$250,000 to the Australian Red  
Cross to help people recover from  
the nation’s devastating bushfires.Crisis response 
solutionsFunding for  
critical causes
We work to help humanitarian 
organizations more efficiently  
and effectively serve people 
impacted or displaced by conflict  
or natural disaster.  
 Through solutions like the 
Mastercard Aid Network and 
initiatives such as the Smart 
Communities Coalition , our 
technologies and partnership 
models can support more 
comprehensive responses.
 Since 2015, the Mastercard 
Aid Network and its prepaid cards 
and debit cards have helped bring 
lifesaving assistance, including 
essentials such as food, blankets, 
tarps and schoolbooks, to more 
than 3 million people around the 
globe. In 2019, more than 12,500 
households were in the Mastercard 
Aid Network.Mastercard leverages our technology 
and network to support nonprofit 
organizations in the health care, 
education and environmental spheres. 
Together, our company, partners, 
employees and cardholders can help  
the next generation thrive. 
 Mastercard enabled the collection  
of more than $20 million in 2019  
through several channels to support 
young people in health, education and 
the environment. Mastercard and our 
partners — issuers, acquirers, merchants 
and governments — collected most of 
these funds through more than 100 
donation-driven marketing campaigns 
and activation programs. These  
donations benefitted highly regarded 
international organizations, as well as 
national nonprofits, in support of local 
projects . The model is simple: Consumer 
transactions over the Mastercard  
network in a defined time frame produce 
a small charitable donation.
 Consumers can actively contribute 
through the Mastercard Donation 
Platform , a digital tool available in 10 
countries with over 3,300 charitable 
organizations. It allows cardholders to 
direct small donations to specific charities 
every time they use their cards. They also 
can register for monthly donations or one-
off donations in support of the causes 
they care about most.

research & treatment
Mastercard is a proud, long-standing 
partner of Stand Up to Cancer 
(SU2C), having donated more than 
$50 million toward cancer research 
and treatment in the past decade. 
 Our support, along with that of 
millions of cardholders, helped SU2C 
fund breakthrough clinical trials 
and new treatments that can save 
lives now. SU2C-supported research 
also led to five new Food and Drug 
Administration-approved cancer 
therapies, including treatments  
for breast, ovarian and pancreatic  
cancers and certain difficult-to-  
treat leukemias.
 Stand Up to Cancer works 
relentlessly to bring the latest, most 
effective and most promising cancer 
treatments to patients as quickly as 
possible by bringing together the best 
minds to collaborate, innovate and 
share their clinical research. In the spirit 
of this collaboration, we developed 
marketing programs that harness the 
collective power of our cardholders. 
From July 1 through Aug. 15, 2019, 
Mastercard committed up to $4 million 
by donating 1 cent to SU2C every  
time a U.S. cardholder charged $10  
or more on their card while dining 
out. We doubled the donation when 
consumers paid for their meals with  
a contactless transaction.Providing nutritious  
meals for children
Since our partnership with the 
World Food Programme (WFP) 
began, Mastercard, its partners  
and cardholders have donated a 
total of $26.9 million1 to fund the 
equivalent value of more than  
107 million meals.2
 For many children born into 
difficult circumstances, a school meal 
is often the only nutritious meal they 
receive each day and it can mean the 
difference between going to school 
or helping their parents at home or in 
the field. The benefits of school meals 
go beyond education and health — 
they are key to unlocking children’s 
potential and helping communities 
build self-sufficiency. Here are just a 
few examples of the on-the-ground 
impact the WFP made around the 
world, with our help, in 2019:In Mali, Mastercard helped the  
WFP reopen closed school canteens 
and expand to 25 new locations 
in 2019, enabling school meals for 
66,000 children.  
 In Jordan, 6,000 Jordanian 
and Syrian children affected by the 
refugee crisis received meals, while 
other refugees (mostly women) were 
hired to cook the meals through the 
WFP Healthy Kitchens project.  
 In Honduras, 3,700 children in 
two municipalities with the highest 
rates of malnutrition received meals, 
made with food purchased from 74 
smallholder farmers. $26.9 million 107 million

Inclusive Growth03OUR PEOPLE 
AND CULTURE
We believe that what we do is as important as 
who we are. We invite our employees to bring 
their hearts, minds and whole selves to work 
every day to push boundaries and imagine new 
possibilities. We attract and recruit those who 
are change-makers, those who want to own 
their path and dare to go further.OUR APPROACH
44Understanding that employees have 
different needs across different 
stages of life, we offer competitive 
rewards and benefits such as 
inclusive family support programs, 
five paid days off for volunteerism, 
flexible work and a generous 
retirement plan match.
 We continue to build a workforce as 
diverse as the markets and customers 
we serve. Purpose is connected to — 
and in service of — influencing and 
impacting societal change. We unlock 
that possibility through our collective 
business initiatives, philanthropic 
efforts and people-first focus, all of 
which are at the core of who we are. 
With a highly engaged workforce — in 
both good and challenging times — we 
think we’re on the right path.As a purpose-driven 
company with a 
long commitment 
to inclusivity, we 
have a broad view 
of what constitutes 
and inspires talent, 
so we develop 
employee skills  
for now and for  
the future. At Mastercard, we embrace  
diversity and inclusiveness and  
create a sense of belonging because 
we know it’s what makes us better 
as colleagues, as a company and as 
citizens of the world.
 We have written in this report 
and in other forums about our 
commitment to decency. Decency sits 
at the core of all we do, working hard 
to ensure that we treat all people of all 
backgrounds, cultures and perspectives 
fairly, providing an equal opportunity to 
grow and advance their careers.
 We speak boldly and loudly about 
our beliefs and the changes that we 
see need to be made . These have 
included immigration, gender equity, 
LGBTQ+ support and, more recently, a 
call against racism. Racism is against 
everything we stand for as a company, 
as a community and as individuals who 
strive to live peacefully and joyfully.  We will continue to lead on these 
causes, using our voice to raise 
awareness and advance solutions, 
while taking action ourselves. This 
is how we have approached many 
issues, focusing on the areas where 
we can have impact — first within 
our own walls and for our employees, 
followed closely by how we approach 
our business and our partnerships 
and programs to support the broader 
community (or economy).
 This spring, we made clear our 
belief that racism is against everything 
we stand for as a company, as a 
community, as individuals. That is why 
we launched In Solidarity, a company-
wide, long-term initiative that activates 
the full breadth of our company’s 
resources to advance inclusion and 
equality. The initial focus will be on 
Black communities in the United States 
and will expand to other geographies 
to address the unique local needs 
and combat all forms of racism and 
discrimination around the globe.Taking a stand,

Our People and CultureREWARDING AND  
PROVIDING BENEFITSMastercard offers competitive 
compensation packages through 
a mix of fixed and variable pay, 
including base salary, annual  
cash incentives and long-term  
stock incentives.
 Compensation is guided by three 
core principles: to align our long-
term interests with our stockholders’ 
interests; to ensure market-
competitive pay across our packages; 
and to design pay packages that 
encourage optimal short- and long-
term performance.
All employees globally have the 
opportunity to receive a contribution 
of 10% of base pay, on a matched 
basis, to employee retirement plans.

employees, the 
communities we 
serve and the  
world at large.
Our development programs  
keep our talent pipeline full  
and allow us to pivot quickly  
when we need to adapt.We improve our employee  
experience by supporting growth in 
critical skills that will help workers 
succeed in their current roles and 
sustain their future marketability. 
 All employees can participate in 
both formal, internal and external 
programming, and informal, self-
directed learning. They are supported 
by a robust suite of offerings targeted 
to build professional and technical skills. 
 The vast majority of employees 
(79%) engaged in a formal learning 
program in 2019, in addition to required 
training. Some of the most popular 
programs addressed communication 
skills, people management, digital 
fluency, innovation, sales, and coding 
and other technical skills. 
 We have a generous tuition 
assistance program for all full‐time  
and most part‐time employees. It  
now includes Massive Open Online 
Courses (MOOCs) from a host of 
universities, enabling our employees  
to earn industry-recognized and 
-verified certificates or credits  
toward traditional advanced  
degrees through providers.  Cutting-edge technology is key 
to Mastercard’s continued-learning 
culture. We’ve created nine “learning 
lounges” connecting employees in 
offices around the globe for team-
based learning and collaboration. We 
also launched two virtual-reality (VR) 
learning labs, engaging employees 
in VR training pilot programs. We’re 
leveraging collaboration tools for peer-
to-peer and on-the-job learning and 
enabling employee access to many 
of the leading online technical and 
professional skill-training providers.
We offer a rich portfolio of 
enrichment opportunities and 
development programs at every 
stage of our employees’ careers. 
Participation in these formal 
development programs more  
than tripled in 2019.
 Recently graduated emerging 
talent takes part in our undergraduate 
entry-level program, an 18-month 
development journey. It begins with 
an experiential boot-camp to help 
young people kick-start their careers 
at Mastercard. The program focuses 
on developing skills through on-the-
job learning and a curated curriculum 
in order to drive career growth and 
advancement.  Relaunch Your Career, our return-to-
work program, is designed to attract, 
develop and reintegrate individuals 
who have been out of the workforce 
for two years or more. The goal of 
the 16-week program is to help them 
secure a full-time role with Mastercard.
 We deliberately invest in developing 
women leaders and increasing their 
representation at senior levels. Women 
Who Lead helps women find and 
amplify their voices, as well as explore 
the dynamics of power and leadership. 
This program equips women with
perspectives and skills for the distinct 
challenges they might face and is an 
opportunity for them to learn from 
one another’s shared experiences.
 Equipping our people-managers 
with the right skills, expectations and 
development opportunities is central 
to ensuring that they can coach and 
lead their teams effectively. The 
people-manager curriculum develops 
managers to lead inclusively. It also 
teaches them to give effective 
feedback, navigate challenging 
conversations and circumstances, and 
build self-awareness of their impact on
others. Another program around 
leadership development looks to help 
our future leaders also build self-
awareness, develop key skills and 
reinforce values-based leadership.  
Both programs build strong leaders 
who protect and nurture our culture  
of decency.Learning and

Our People and CultureOur culture is driven by ongoing 
development that is focused on our 
customers, communities and society. 
It is supported by a wide array of 
opportunities for our talent to own 
and drive their careers.
 Fundamental elements of 
this support are nurturing people 
managers and providing time to help 
employees plan their long-term career 
development. In 2019, all employees 
had these conversations, and 80%  
said they found them meaningful.  We believe experience and exposure 
are key to enabling great performance, 
which is why we encourage movement 
across areas of the business and the 
free flow of talent across geographic 
borders. Many employees “cross-
pollinate” through business units and 
acquired companies to build breadth 
in different roles throughout the 
organization. Managers facilitate 
“double-hatting,” or “stretch 
assignments,” for those keen to explore 
other areas without switching jobs. 
It allows talent to lead a project in 
another area of the business while 
maintaining their current role. 
 We believe there is no better driver 
of performance than allowing people 
to grow and reach their potential. 
Ultimately, we are creating an 
environment where people can build  
a meaningful career and that allows  
us to attract and retain top talent.A culture

the way we expect.

Our People and CultureBusiness Resource Groups 
Mastercard has nine employee 
affinity groups, called Business 
Resource Groups (BRGs), to support 
employees’ professional development 
and improve their leadership skills.  
 These BRGs act as internal business 
consultants, helping the company with 
consumer research, cultural insights, 
customer segmentation and access 
to networks. While each BRG focuses 
on a specific area, they all are guided 
by our culture of inclusion and are 
open to all employees. More than 100 
BRG chapters are in 35 Mastercard 
locations. As of May 2020, more 
than a third of our global workforce 
participates in these groups:
• ADAPTability: Employees  
with disabilities and their  
friends and families
• EAST: Exploring Asian Societies  
and Trends
• ePros: Experienced Professionals 
• Latin Network: Employees of  
Latin descent
• LEAD:  Leading Employees of 
African Descent
• PRIDE:  Fostering an environment 
of inclusivity and respect for LGBTQ 
employees
• SALUTE: Active and veteran 
military personnel and their families
• WLN: Women’s Leadership 
Network
• YoPros: Young ProfessionalsBRG highlights from 2019
• PRIDE  partnered with the North 
America Marketing & Issuer 
teams to find a solution for 
LGBTQIA+ consumers whose 
legal names don’t match their 
gender identity or presentation. 
The newly developed True Name™  
card allows for a chosen name 
to appear on the front of cards. 
PRIDE support also led to the 
company underwriting rainbow-
colored signs in Manhattan’s 
West Village for the newly named 
“Acceptance Street,” formerly 
called Gay Street.  
• ADAPT chapter leaders and 
members volunteered their 
personal stories for a global 
training video issued to all of  
our employees.The newly debuted Global Inclusion & 
Diversity Experience  helps employees 
learn more about our foundational 
inclusion and diversity work, how 
employee Business Resource Groups, 
or BRGs (see adjacent), are making 
an impact, and how Mastercard is 
committed to gender balance. It 
also highlights inclusion and diversity 
information at the local level.
 The overall experience challenges 
employees to consider their own 
efforts to be inclusive and asks them, 
“What are you doing to create a 
culture of belonging, with decency at 
its core?”
 The Diverse Recruitment Advisory 
Committee supports efforts to 
hire diverse talent. It is composed of 
Mastercard colleagues across the 
company working together to ensure 
we represent a diverse array of 
backgrounds and perspectives.
 We’ve also developed Regional 
Action Plans  across all five Mastercard 
regions: North America, Europe, Middle 
East and Africa, Latin America and 
the Caribbean, and Asia Pacific. They 
help us identify and develop plans to 
achieve regional priorities, including 
inclusion and balance in gender and 
racial representation. The Inclusion Leadership Think Tank  
consists of Mastercard employees from 
diverse communities around the world. 
They meet regularly to share insights and 
help develop impactful case studies that 
will help support a culture of inclusion 
and belonging. The case studies are used 
in various programs across the company 
as educational tools and to raise 
awareness among leaders at all levels. 
 In response to employee feedback, 
we piloted a Mid-Career Inclusion 
Elective in 2019 to help women and 
people of African descent successfully 
navigate their careers at Mastercard 
by exploring their personal strengths 
and opportunities. Participants in 
the six-month program engaged in a 
development experience addressing 
some of the distinctive challenges they  
face in the workplace.
 Our Seat at the Table Campaign   
was designed to reinforce inclusive 
behaviors in employees by encouraging 
them to take small, meaningful actions in 
their daily lives to embrace diversity and 
reinforce our core principle of decency.  
It was launched this year in Purchase, 
New York; London; Singapore; St. Louis; 
and the New York City Tech Hub.

Our People and Culture“  The core of what 
unites us at 
Mastercard is our 
commitment to 
decency; racism or 
mistreatment of any 
kind will never be 
tolerated here.”
 Ajay Banga
 CEO, MastercardOur workplace is a safe place for 
employees to be themselves and 
voice their opinions.
 Mastercard does not tolerate 
unlawful discrimination, harassment or 
retaliation by employees or our vendors, 
contractors or business partners. This 
includes sexual harassment, degrading 
or offensive comments or jokes, 
violence, intimidation or threats.
 All Mastercard employees receive 
training on these policies and have 
several ways to report concerns, 
including an anonymous ethics 
helpline. We also set and evolve our 
conduct standards to align with our 
culture and drive change when we see 
opportunities for improvement and 
enhancement. We achieve these goals 
through our four pillars:  • We communicate our workplace 
policies that, along with our Code of 
Conduct, embody our expectations 
for how we conduct ourselves and 
treat one another at Mastercard, 
and which are the foundation of  
our culture.
• We train our human resources 
professionals on emerging trends 
and best practices, our managers 
on the Mastercard Way and our 
employees on upholding our culture.
• We listen to our employees when 
they have concerns, investigate 
those concerns and conduct regular 
climate checks to monitor our 
workplace culture.
• We respond by providing guidance to 
our human resources professionals 
and business partners and by 
holding everyone accountable for 
their conduct with appropriate 
transparency, consistency and 
fairness.The security of our company, brand, 
employees, facilities and information 
is paramount at Mastercard, as is 
our commitment to providing a safe 
working environment.  
 The Corporate Security department 
proactively protects the company 
and our employees, advising on risk-
mitigation and threat preparedness. 
We use physical, technical and 
administrative safeguards to 
protect personal information and 
require anyone authorized to access 
employees’ health data to undergo 
detailed training on its ethical use.
 We’ve developed an e-learning 
platform that promotes security 
awareness and communicates security 
policies, and we also offer virtual-
reality safety training. Mastercard 
provides enterprise-wide classroom 
training in first aid, CPR, automatic 
external defibrillator (AED) use and 
women’s self-defense.A workplace free

Our People and CultureENRICHING OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE WORLD
Mastercard employees want to give 
back, so we make it easy for them. 
Nearly 90% of our employees say the 
company supports their community 
engagement efforts. 
Full-time employees are allowed up 
to five paid days per year for eligible 
volunteer work and community 
outreach. It’s simple: Living our 
values and improving the world 
through service go hand-in-hand.
 This year, we consolidated all our 
community service work under the 
new Mastercard Impact Corps .
 It’s our way of galvanizing 
employees to give with their time, 
skills and charitable donations, and 
it provides a stronger framework for 
delivering meaningful social impact at 
scale. The Impact Corps encapsulates 
all the ways our employees give back 
and use their skills for social good, 
from team-based volunteering to 
long-term, pro-bono placements to 
STEM mentoring and even making a 
difference on their own time.  Mastercard also matches charitable 
giving up to $15,000 per employee 
annually. Additionally, employees who 
volunteer at least 40 hours per year 
with a single organization are eligible 
to apply for up to four $500 grants to 
help further the nonprofit’s work.
 Those matches increased 86% in 
2019, largely due to the Giving Tuesday 
initiative, which offered a 2:1 match 
for donations during the campaign 
in early December. Together with our 
employees, we raised over $3,000,000.Total giving

Our People and CultureMilitary mentoring 
For the past five years, Mastercard 
has sponsored American Corporate 
Partners  (ACP), a program that  
assists members of the military 
transitioning to the civilian workforce. 
In that time, 195 employees in the U.S. 
and U.K. participated in one-on-one, 
yearlong mentorships to aid nearly  
450 veterans.
Teaching tomorrow’s  
business leaders
With a 14-year partnership with  
Junior Achievement, more than  
6,000 employees in our U.S. offices  
of St. Louis, Kansas City and New  
York, as well as in Dublin, Ireland, have 
volunteered with Junior Achievement 
programs in schools, teaching more 
than 85,000 K-8 students.
Supporting future entrepreneurs
Mastercard is helping inspire students 
in underserved areas in the U.S., 
Mexico and China to envision, develop 
and launch their own businesses. 
Since 2010, we’ve partnered with the 
Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship 
(NFTE), a nonprofit that activates 
the entrepreneurial mindset and 
builds startup skills in youths from 
under-resourced communities. We’ve 
contributed volunteer hours and 
donated more than $9 million to 
support its global mission in the past 
decade. Several employees also serve 
as members of various boards.Below are some of the ways in  
which our people enrich their 
communities and the world:
Girls4Tech
Our award-winning Girls4Tech™ 
education program, designed for girls 
around the world ages 8-16, aims to 
create future problem-solvers. Based 
on STEM principles, Girls4Tech was 
developed in conjunction with our 
top engineers and technologists to 
showcase Mastercard’s payments 
technology, incorporating our deep 
expertise in encryption, fraud 
detection, cybersecurity, AI, data 
privacy, and more. 
 As of 2019, Girls4Tech has engaged 
more than 4,500 employee mentors 
to reach more than 375,000 girls in 
72 countries. We continue to expand 
the global reach of the program by 
translating the curriculum into 13 
languages and continuing partnerships 
with Scholastic, Network for Teaching 
Entrepreneurship, American Airlines 
and Major League Baseball . And  
we’ve begun new partnerships with 
The R&A (the governing body for  
golf outside the U.S. and Mexico) and 
YCAB Foundation in Indonesia — all 
with the goal of advancing STEM 
education for girls.

In partnership with Accion , we 
enhanced our pro bono program to 
immerse our employees into this 
organization, where they use their skills 
to improve product design, governance, 
and more. This partnership develops 
employees’ skills in critical thinking, 
data analytics, digital transformation 
and experimentation while supporting 
our shared efforts with Accion to help 
micro businesses benefit from the 
digital economy.World Food Programme
Every day, countless children across 
the globe turn up for school on 
an empty stomach. That’s why 
Mastercard has partnered with the 
World Food Programme since 2012, 
focusing on the transformational 
power of school meals, which can help 
improve children’s health, cognitive 
development, access to education 
and lifetime earnings. Our employees 
conduct annual cost-benefit analyses 
to help local governments around the 
world better understand the long-term 
benefits that school meals provide for 
children and their economies. Since 
2015, over 35 Mastercard employees 
have completed 21 WFP four-week 
missions, using their leadership and 
professional skills to complete these 
analyses in more than 20 countries.Being a Force for Good starts  
with our efforts around financial 
inclusion, but it’s also about building 
an inspired workforce.  
 Our Impact Corps includes our 
pro bono efforts, which range from 
virtual to team-based to full-scale 
immersion opportunities. They allow 
our employees to use their skills to 
benefit our communities around the 
world. Here are two examples: Our annual CEO Force for Good 
Awards recognize employees who 
make a meaningful difference in

STEWARDSHIP
We believe “sustainable” is more than  
an adjective to be added before nouns.  
For us, it’s a daily mindset we’re embedding 
throughout our organization. OUR APPROACH
65This reflects the universal importance 
of environmental consciousness 
among our customers, stakeholders, 
cardholders and Mastercard’s people 
at every level. 
 We announced our commitment 
to align with the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures’ 
recommendations, and we will be 
working toward this commitment. 
This proactive, voluntary commitment 
provides increased transparency so our 
stakeholders can better understand 
how Mastercard measures and 
responds to climate change risks.Highlights
Our commitment to environmental 
sustainability starts at the top and 
runs deep. In 2020, our Board of 
Directors affirmed the critical nature 
of environmental stewardship, placing 
it within the purview of the Nominating 
and Corporate Governance Committee. First in the payments industry to receive 
approval from the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi) for our updated 
emissions target, which aligns to a 
1.5-degree Celsius climate trajectory. 1.5°
celsius
 By activating our partners and 
more than 2.6 billion consumer 
and corporate cards, we’ll have an 
even larger impact. We’re creating 
environmentally sustainable solutions 
that can be replicated locally or 
scaled globally. Mastercard believes 
sustainability isn’t just the best  
choice — it’s the only one. 38%
Our new target calls for a 38% absolute 
reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse 
gas emissions by 2025 from our 2016 
base year, and a 20% reduction in Scope 
3 emissions over the same period.

At present, we have lowered Scope 1  
and 2 emissions by 43% from 2016,  
and Scope 3 by 40%. 100

the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi), determining it meets the 
1.5-degree Celsius target — the 
most ambitious designation 
recognized by SBTi. 
 From our 2016 baseline, we resolve 
to reach the 1.5-degree level by 
targeting a 38% absolute reduction in 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 
and a 20% absolute reduction in 
Scope 3 emissions by 2025. OPERATIONAL

 In the coming years, we will  
lessen our  dependence on unbundled 
renewable energy credits by investing 
in new renewables projects that bring 
more power onto the grid.  We’re making powerful strides 
toward that goal by expanding our 
onsite solar footprint at our owned

Environmental StewardshipWhile Mastercard owns only a few 
of our 139 global facilities, we’ve 
continued our work to make every 
building sustainable. 
 We certify every project that is 
eligible. All our owned campuses and 
owned data centers are certified 
by Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED). LEED 
is a globally recognized symbol of 
achievement in sustainability. Outside 
the U.S., all of our eligible building 
projects achieve national green 
certifications for the countries in  
which they’re located. Collaboration 
with our planners, developers and 
utilities around the world helps us 
find the best efficiency solutions 
everywhere we work.Green buildings  New construction follows our 
Global Workplace Design Standards, 
with sustainability built into the 
process from start to finish. Every 
project is built with its environmental 
performance in mind to receive 
green building certification, including 
incorporating renewable energy 
sources and improving water efficiency. 
Older buildings are retrofitted to run as 
efficiently and sustainably as possible. 
For example, we’re using new LEED 
v4.1 guidelines to certify offices in the 
U.S. and Latin America.
 We also recognize the enormous 
opportunity to extend our sustainability 
initiatives to the leased properties 
we occupy. All renewing leases for 
Mastercard workplaces are reviewed 
to include requirements for renewable 
energy and other sustainability 
measures. For new leases, we prioritize 
locations with green certifications. 
In 2019, we set energy intensity unit 
requirements (EIU, which measures 
kWh consumption per square foot) for 
every new project, empowering our 
planners, builders and contractors to 
work together for creative efficiency 
solutions adapted to every locale.  
We’ve also begun to implement those 
same standards at existing properties. Additionally, we installed sub-
metering technology in many of our 
offices to identify energy-saving 
opportunities to help reach our science-
based emissions goals. We continue to 
expand that to our leased office space. 
We’ve installed advanced lighting 
controls that monitor natural light 
levels and office occupancy to optimize 
use, and we’ve partnered with utilities 
to further assess and identify other 
energy-saving opportunities. TODAY, NEARLY 85% OF

Environmental StewardshipData centers
Data centers account for 55% of Mastercard’s 
total energy use across the board. That 
percentage explains why we place such a high 
priority on their efficiency. We operate five 
data centers, and through continual upgrades 
and energy-saving projects, we practice the 
same GHG reduction measures in our data 
centers as we do in our offices.
We’re proud to report that this year one of our 
data centers has been recertified Gold under 
LEED-Operations + Maintenance, achieving 
power-use effectiveness of 1.39 in 2019. An 
air handler recirculation project supported this 
success by saving 401,232 kWh at the site. 
Continual improvements like that help us meet 
and exceed our targets in all our owned spaces.
Across the globe, Mastercard has co-located 
data centers, which are facilities in which 
Mastercard rents space for services and other 
computing hardware but does not manage 
the operations. We include sustainability 
requirements in our data center RFPs and 
ensure we choose the most efficient sites 
that also meet our security requirements 
and data needs. We also strive to choose co-
located data centers that take environmental 
sustainability into consideration.
We have been monitoring power use

data centers and have begun monitoring it  
at co-locations in 2020. Our commitment to sustainable 
leasing was nationally recognized in 
2020 when the U.S. Department of 
Energy and the Institute for Market 
Transformation named Mastercard a 
2020 Gold-level Green Lease Leader 
through the Better Buildings Initiative. 
The award recognizes our strong 
commitment to high performance 
and sustainability in leased buildings, 
specifically at our future Dublin facility. 
Our best-practice lease agreement 
there outlines equipment and lighting 
efficiency, energy management 
tracking, and purchase of onsite and 
offsite renewable energy, among  
other measures.
 In Sydney, we worked with the 
Green Building Council of Australia on 
a pilot program to reach three-star 
Green Star certification in the country. 
The review process assessed the 
sustainability attributes of our Sydney 
project in nine broad categories, 
including management, land use, 
ecology and innovation. Mastercard’s 
partnership in this pilot program 
produced a custom framework and 
set of guidelines that the Council 
will ultimately formalize into a set 
of official national standards for all 
of Australia. The insights we gained 
through this collaborative process will 
help refine sustainability practices in 
Mastercard properties worldwide.

Environmental StewardshipSupplier  
engagement
Mastercard is especially proud of 
our innovative and collaborative 
approach to supplier sustainability, 
which earned leadership recognition. 
We received an “A” rating for Supplier 
Engagement from CDP , a global 
environmental disclosure system 
whose members measure, manage 
and disclose their risks and successes 
on climate change.
 We don’t manufacture physical 
goods, but the sustainability of each 
of our suppliers affects Mastercard’s 
emissions score. Our top-emitting 
supplier categories are advertising and 
related services, telecommunications 
and electronic computer manufacturing.  
In total, our supply chain contributes 
more than 70% of our total carbon 
footprint, so we’re working to help our 
suppliers become more environmentally 
conscious.
 This begins with our clear message 
that sustainability is crucial to how 
Mastercard does business. We’ve 
added a sustainability element to our 
supplier-onboarding process, which 
serves a dual purpose. It acknowledges 
sustainability leaders among our 
potential partners and reinforces 
their positive impact. It also enables 
us to engage suppliers that are eager 
to learn and improve; our expertise 
and guidance can empower their 
meaningful progress.  Beyond onboarding, we’ve added 
sustainability requirements to our requests 
for proposals and contractual language  
to our master supplier agreements. 
 We have upgraded our level of  
hands-on supplier interaction with  
programs including Mastercard’s  
Environmental Development Initiative,  
which is designed to help big and small  
companies improve their environmental  
sustainability. This initiative includes  
not only resource materials and  
best practices but also direct  
dialogue between our Environmental  
Sustainability Team and supply  
chain partners. This level of personal  
engagement has helped improve  
the quality of data and responses  
from suppliers on their environmental  
impact, and how much it contributed  
to our footprint. That, in turn, has  
helped to reduce their emissions,  
which is something we will continue  
to track and report.
Business travel
We’ve implemented new systems 
to make tele-connecting easier to 
reduce internal business travel.  
 When traveling is necessary, we 
encourage direct flights and staying 
at green hotels. We also buy offsets 
for all business travel so that when 
we do travel, we’re doing it in an 
environmentally conscious way. ENVIRONMENTAL

Environmental StewardshipEmployee 
engagement
Mastercard engages our  
18,600 global employees in  
our continual efforts to be a  
more sustainable company.
 We acknowledge a balance must 
exist between our environmental 
commitment and ongoing health and 
personal well-being best practices. 
That is why we took concrete steps 
to eliminate damaging plastic waste 
and cut back on our employee carbon 
footprint by swapping single-use 
plastic for sustainable options in our 
cafeterias, kitchens and pantries. We 
provide reusable cups and have added 
hydration stations where employees 
can enjoy a variety of plain, flavored 
and sparkling waters without single-
use bottles. We replaced one-time-
use coffeemaker cups — a staggering 
contributor of plastic waste in recent 
years — with fresh-ground coffee 
beans. We even updated all our signs 
to help drive home our sustainability 
mindset. The result has been a better-
educated workforce that’s empowered 
to make more informed, sustainable 
choices.
 For the second year, we increased 
and met our goal for waste diversion, 
achieving an average of 80% across 
our owned sites in 2019. We’ve 
increased that goal to 85% waste 
diversion in 2020, with an eventual goal 
of zero waste in our owned facilities in 
the U.S. We got there by educating our 
employees, expanding and improving  Mastercard provides our people 
with multiple opportunities throughout 
the year to learn about sustainability 
in a casual and engaging environment. 
Our onsite community gardens allow 
employees to grow whatever they like. 
We also have our own honey-producing 
beehives. 
 This year, we sponsored electric-
vehicle demonstrations at several 
sites, allowing local staff to test-drive 
different electric vehicles and learn 
more about them. We encourage 
employee use of EVs by giving those 
who drive them preferential parking in 
lots closer to the building, along with 
free charging.our composting efforts and adding 
new signs. We achieved 100% recycling 
for our electronic waste. We also have 
hosted efforts to divert waste from 
landfills by encouraging employees to 
bring in discarded candy wrappers from 
Halloween, waste from the holidays 
and e-waste from their homes.

MASTERCARD AND DOCONOMY 
ANNOUNCED A CARD PRODUCT  
DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS 
WITH TOOLS FOR CLIMATE ACTIONMost consumers would like to take 
action against climate change, but 
they often don’t know how — so 
Mastercard identified the right 
partners to help achieve that. Our 
issuers can offer tools for cardholders 
to track the environmental impact of 
their purchases.
 In partnership with the Swedish 
fintech company Doconomy, 
Mastercard is making available the 
Åland Index Solution as a means of 
giving consumers insight into their 
carbon footprint. Drawing on a broad 
base of leading financial data, the 
Åland index connects each transaction 
category to its impact on the 
planet. The solution offers a proven, 
independent benchmark climate index 
and has been improved with data 
through a newly formed partnership 
with Trucost, a part of S&P Global.  In 2018, Mastercard and 
Doconomy announced a card product 
designed to provide consumers with 
tools for climate action — carbon-
footprint calculations provided by 
the Åland index, the ability to offset 
impacts through donations to U.N.-
certified climate projects, and an 
environmentally friendly payment  
card produced with biodegradable 
materials and printed with Air-Ink  
using recycled pollutants. 
 To support our ongoing commitment 
to improving consumers’ visibility and 
awareness of their environmental 
impact, we’ve made an equity 
investment in Doconomy to further 
scale the expansion of carbon tracking 
and other sustainable product  
solutions to additional markets.

Environmental StewardshipLoyalty point 
redemptions   
Cardholders can  
use loyalty points  
to donateIn January 2020, Mastercard 
launched the Priceless Planet 
Coalition  to unite corporate 
sustainability efforts and preserve 
the environment through the 
restoration of 100 million trees. 
Mastercard believes that by working 
with our partners in the private 
sector we can have a real impact 
by combining efforts and engaging 
businesses and consumers to  
take action. 
 Founding partners in the Coalition 
include American Airlines, bunq, 
Citibank, IHS Markit, L.L. Bean, Saks 
Fifth Avenue, Santander UK and the 
urban-transit institutions New York 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
and Transport for London. All Coalition 
partners will launch campaigns to 
engage consumers to contribute to the 
tree-planting program. Mastercard’s 
global payment infrastructure will 
provide additional ways for cardholders 
to contribute, including “round-up” 
campaigns at a range of leading 
retailers that allow consumers to add a 
tree-planting donation at the point-of-
sale. Our corporate customers can also 
contribute to this effort every time 
employees use their cards for travel,
goods or services by contributing 
rebates they receive from their banks 
to tree-planting projects. Priceless Planet Coalition
 Large-scale restoration programs 
need to be executed deliberately, 
with consideration given to several 
factors. Mastercard has selected the 
global environmental organizations 
Conservation International and World 
Resources Institute as our forestry 
partners to lead the mobilization and 
coordination of tree-planting efforts, 
based on their science-based and 
holistic approaches to restoration  
and successful track records in  
global conservation.
 With the help of these 
organizations, Mastercard is 
developing a global portfolio of 
high-quality restoration projects, 
emphasizing those with the most 
potential for positive impacts on 
climate, community and biodiversity. 
All restoration efforts under the 
Priceless Planet Coalition will adopt 
and adhere to rigorous science-based 
best practices for project selection, 
implementation and monitoring. 
Importantly, an independent advisory 
committee will provide oversight for 
the Priceless Planet Coalition to keep 
our effort on track. This group of 
experts considers the latest scientific 
data and insights to ensure that our 
commitments achieve the most good 
for the environment. Direct donations

Environmental StewardshipMany consumers are consciously 
limiting their use of single-use 
plastics, such as shopping bags and 
drinking straws, and are challenging 
businesses to take similar action in 
reducing plastic waste. 
 To support this movement in 
alignment with growing consumer 
sentiment, Mastercard established the 
Greener Payments Partnership (GPP) 
with key industry partners Giesecke 
& Devrient, IDEMIA and Thales. Early 
in 2020, we welcomed our newest 
member, CPI Card Group. The GPP 
is a cross-industry initiative of card 
manufacturers seeking to further 
the goal of reducing the use of new 
polyvinyl chloride (commonly known as 
PVC) in all plastic payment cards. With 
payment-card shipments accounting 
for 33,000 tons of plastic annually, 
according to the Nilson Report, the 
impact might be limited, but we’re 
committed to doing our part in an  
area where we have major influence. Greener  
Payments 
Partnership  To that end, the GPP published 
a shortlist of over 25 products and 
suppliers that provide an alternative 
to first-use PVC traditionally used 
in payment cards. The effort is the 
first milestone of a long-term effort 
to identify alternative, sustainable 
materials — ethically, bio- and ocean-
sourced, and chlorine-free — in everyday 
products. The list offers financial 
institutions a resource to learn more 
about those alternatives, connect them 
to card manufacturers and ultimately 
augment their own sustainability 
initiatives with a systemic change to 
their supply chains.  
 To further our efforts and 
capabilities in plastics analysis 
and research, Mastercard has 
invested in the innovative Bruker 
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) 
spectrometer, a Zeiss Scanning 
electron microscope and a Zeiss 
SmartProof confocal microscope.  FTIR spectroscopy enables 
independent analysis of a card’s 
material makeup so we can assess and 
validate our vendors’ environmental 
claims. By examining cards at a 
molecular level, we can identify the 
plastics and adhesives in each layer. 
Our scanning electron microscopes 
scale down further, to the nanometer 
range, to identify card constructs and 
potential contaminants. Mastercard 
can leverage these insights with 
vendors and issuers for quality control 
and sustainable benefit. We can 
also apply this data to new product 
development and design. 
 Those high-technology investments 
ensure that we are making an active 
contribution to the GPP and help  
us deliver new insights to the  
global market.

INVESTMENTS ENSURE THAT WE ARE 
MAKING AN ACTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO 
THE GPP AND HELP US DELIVER NEW 
INSIGHTS TO THE GLOBAL MARKET“ While our own 
footprint on 
greenhouse gases 
is relatively small, 
where we can really 
make a difference 
at scale is by  
using our network 
effect to reach  
our customers

   2  The State of Food Security and Nutrition  
in the World (2019).Test & Learn® Solar energy
In October, we celebrated our first 
year since launch in Uganda with our 
Pay on Demand solar initiative.  
 In partnership with M-KOPA Solar  
and Centenary Bank , this pilot program 
unlocks pay-per-use philosophy 
to make energy affordable. The 
technology allows Ugandans to make 
installment payments for solar panels 
through mobile phones with a simple 
scan of a quick response (QR) code or 
text message. Early results show steps 
to make a consumer payment for 
connected solar panels were cut in half. 
 To connect to M-KOPA and start to 
build their credit histories, customers 
pay a deposit and then small, daily 
payments toward electricity. The cost 
is typically less than what they would 
have spent on kerosene, candles and 
batteries. Additionally, bank customers 
can use our integrated Pay on Demand 
API to buy M-KOPA electronics through 
loans with the same micropayment 
structure. 
 After a successful pilot, we  
launched in seven more branches in 
late December. We believe this model 
could be applied to other use cases, 
including provision of water, access  
to smartphones, and other assets. To address these challenges,  
Test & Lear n® has helped participating 
companies assess their menus to 
evaluate premade items most prone 
to spoilage. Our insights showed 
differing outcomes based on the 
customers’ busiest times of day. 
We’ve helped a grocery chain evaluate 
new technologies to maintain the 
freshness of produce and implement 
it thoughtfully, in the locations that 
would benefit the most. Other food 
retailers discovered that adding doors 
to their open coolers and switching to 
dimmer, more efficient lighting would 
not harm traffic or sales.Mastercard’s Test & Learn ® platform 
gives retailers the freedom to 
experiment and fine-tune their ideas 
before their broad release, and 
some of our customers are using 
our capabilities in this area to test 
environmentally conscious products 
and operations.
 In 2019, we saw an uptick in  
retailers experimenting with key  
areas of sustainability, including  
their stores’ energy efficiency and  
new food-focused technologies to 
preserve freshness and prolong  
shelf life, reducing spoilage and  
cutting food waste.
 Food spoilage is an immense 
problem globally, and a critical one to 
solve. Experts estimate that 1.3 billion 
tons of food go to waste each year1 — 
enough to feed the world’s 815 million 
hungry people four times over.2  
It’s also a major business problem:  
Wasted food accounts for roughly 
$680 billion in annual losses for 
industrial countries and $310 billion  
in the developing world.3

 The Helpline is hosted by an 
independent third party, and 
anonymous reports can be made 
where permitted by local law. We 
promptly investigate all concerns with 
our relevant internal investigative 
functions, and we bring in external 
support such as outside counsel as 
needed. To increase transparency 
regarding our investigative process 
and associated outcomes, twice a

ethical or legal concerns, we have a 
Non-Retaliation Policy that forbids 
retaliation against anyone who raises 
a concern based on a reasonable 
belief of a violation of applicable laws 
or regulations, the Code of Conduct 
or one of Mastercard’s other policies. 
Anyone found in breach of the Non-
Retaliation Policy will be subject to 
disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination of employment. We have made innovative 
advancements to continue to 
prevent our products, services and 
technologies from being used for

complying with all applicable laws 
and regulations. We are subject to  
an increasingly rigorous landscape  
of regulatory oversight and 
compliance that is further affected  
by diversification of our products  
and services.  
 Mastercard takes reasonable steps 
to implement policies, procedures 
and programs designed to promote 
compliance with applicable laws  
and regulatory obligations. We 
coordinate globally while acting  
locally and leverage our expertise  
and relationships to manage the

fully competitive marketplace, 
encouraging open and dynamic 
markets that drive innovation and 
value for our company and our 
customers. We are focused on 
creating innovative products  
and services that are attractive

strategy includes policies, procedures, 
controls and employee education to 
ensure that we thoughtfully manage the 
risks to our business while maintaining the 
flexibility needed to grow, diversify and 
build, and meet our commitments and 
obligations to stakeholders.
We continue to implement the latest 
technologies and dynamic, data-
driven controls — including artificial 
intelligence — to help us identify, 
assess and mitigate risk.  
 The purpose of risk management is 
not to eliminate risk from the business 
model but to ensure that the business 
maximizes its value by making the right 
risk-reward trade-offs. We recognize 
the inherent tension between risk and 
reward, and encourage our leaders, and 
all employees, to take thoughtful risks 
to ensure that Mastercard sustains a 
strong innovation culture and delivers 
long-term value for stakeholders.   Our Board of Directors, which  
oversees our risk-management 
framework, promotes a risk-aware 
culture by encouraging thoughtful risk-
taking to serve our business objectives. 
The Board exercises this oversight directly 
and indirectly through its three standing 
committees. More information about 
these committees is available in our  
2020 Proxy Statement.
 The Board’s risk oversight and 
management’s ownership of risk 
are foundational components of our 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
program. We developed our ERM 
program to support comprehensive, integrated oversight and management 
of existing and emerging risks.  
It also informs transparent risk 
identification and risk reporting to 
senior management and the Board.  
All employees are expected to 
understand, monitor and escalate 
risk related to their roles, while 
recommending and implementing 
controls where appropriate. 
 The Risk Management Committee 
(RMC), composed of senior executives, 
is responsible for guiding our ERM 
program. Several members report 
regularly to the Board to help  
establish the appropriate risk culture 
and align risk management with 
Mastercard’s strategy.
 Another important element of 
our risk-management framework 
includes embedding risk champions 
and risk program leads in the business, 
establishing Business Risk and Control 
Committees (BRCCs) to help drive 
these activities and better prepare 
the company to respond to new and 
emerging risks, including environmental 
changes and human rights. 
 We continue to evaluate our risks 
against our Board-approved Risk 
Appetite Statement to align Board 
and management expectations while 
balancing the need for stability and 
reliability against agility, innovation  
and entrepreneurial risk-taking.RESPONSIBLE RISK MANAGEMENT

Ethical and Responsible StandardsThat vision extends to how we handle 
the personal information of our 
employees, customers, cardholders 
and users. This long-standing 
commitment to data and privacy 
ethics has earned our partners’  
trust — and helps us maintain it.   
 That’s why privacy, security and 
data protection are at the heart of 
how we do business. PRIVACY AND  
DATA MANAGEMENT
The idea that 
payments should 
be safe, simple and 
smart guides our 
efforts today to 
help deliver a world 
beyond cash. Privacy and  
data governance
Several of Mastercard’s senior 
executives are entrusted with the 
responsibility of upholding our 
company-wide commitment to best 
practices in privacy, data governance 
and data security.
Chief Data Officer   
Oversees Mastercard’s efforts 
to maintain a responsible, ethical 
enterprise data program that adheres 
to our high standards for data quality, 
curation and governance. The officer 
reports to the president of our Data & 
Services business, but it’s an enterprise-
wide position. The Chief Data Officer 
provides updates, as needed, to 
senior management and the Board 
of Directors on our data practices, 
including an assessment of our data  
risk and progress related to the use  
of information as part of our  
innovation strategy.
Chief Privacy Officer  
Leads our compliance with worldwide 
laws and regulations regarding how we 
collect, use, share, store and transfer 
data, and manages our relevant 
engagements with regulators and 
policymakers. The CPO reports directly 
to Mastercard’s General Counsel. 
Annually, or more frequently if needed, 
the Chief Privacy Officer provides a 
comprehensive assessment of the 
program and related privacy and data 
protection risks to the Audit Committee. Twice a year, Mastercard’s security, 
privacy and information practices   
are reviewed by United States  
financial regulators for compliance 
with the requirements of U.S.  
financial privacy laws.
Data Protection Officer
Leads our Global Privacy Compliance 
Assurance program to ensure that 
Mastercard continues to adhere 
to global General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) standards and local 
privacy requirements. Additionally, 
the DPO oversees the protection 
of personal data in the European 
Economic Area (EEA), including the 
handling of privacy requests from 
individuals to exercise their new rights. 
Reports to the Chief Privacy Officer.
Chief Security Officer   
Develops and oversees the 
programs, policies and controls we 
have implemented to reduce and 
prevent logical and physical risks to 
our people, intellectual assets and 
tangible property. Annually, and 
more frequently as needed, the Chief 
Security Officer (CSO) provides 
a comprehensive assessment of 
the program and related risks and 
vulnerabilities to the Audit Committee. 
Additionally, the CSO periodically 
conducts briefings for the Chief 
Executive Officer, or a designee, on 
security initiatives and emerging 
threats, trends and tactics that could 
impact the organization. Reports 
to the President of Operations and 
Technology and the General Counsel.

business, and is a vital responsibility 
to our customers, account holders 
and employees.  We believe an 
organization’s data practices must be 
guided by the rights of individuals.  
 This core commitment permeates 
the company, and we train every 
employee to handle data with the 
utmost care, in compliance with all 
applicable laws and regulations and in 
line with our culture of decency.  
 Building on our world-class security 
and privacy practices, in 2019, 
Mastercard launched the Global 
Data Responsibility Imperative  — a 
public commitment to ethical and 
responsible data practices that 
enable data innovation while honoring 
individuals, their data rights and the 
trust they place in Mastercard. For 
individuals, this means an increased 
understanding of their ownership, 
control, security and privacy and, 
ultimately, how their lives are made 
better by our use of their data.Data 
responsibility
Mastercard has developed principles to 
guide our product innovation practices 
and ensure the ethical and responsible 
use of data, including:
A commitment to best-in-class 
security and privacy.
Ensuring accountability  in data 
practices, including a commitment  
to accuracy and quality. 
Providing transparency and control   
so individuals understand how their 
data is being used. 
Ensuring integrity  for our analytics, 
including a deliberate minimization  
of bias. 
A commitment to innovation that 
continually improves our products. 
A promise to use data for positive 
social impact.
 This also means responsibly 
sourcing, curating, managing and 
applying strong data governance to 
increasingly large and diverse data 
stores to enable opportunities for data 
innovation. Together these principles 
underscore Mastercard’s belief 
that responsible data practices are 
sustainable business practices.
86
Ethical and Responsible StandardsPrivacy  
by Design
Privacy by Design is always at the 
heart of Mastercard’s commitment 
to responsible innovation. We build 
privacy and data protection into 
every one of our products and 
services. It starts in the design 
process at ideation and moves 
through development and delivery.  
 Much of our work in this space 
involves business insights using 
information that has been scrubbed 
and aggregated to remove details 
that could be linked to an individual. 
These services don’t involve the sharing 
or exchange of the transaction data 
itself. We use personal information 
only in a legitimate, fair and inclusive 
manner, with full respect for the 
choices made by individuals. Everything 
we do respects the choices that the 
individual has made. Mastercard is 
constantly innovating to improve 
privacy and security. We use privacy-enhancing techniques such as world-
class anonymization to further protect 
personal information. We’ve pioneered 
solutions like Trūata  to support these 
efforts and anonymize data so we are 
able to identify trends and insights 
to help businesses, governments, the 
public sector and individuals better 
understand the world and support 
urban planning and economic analysis, 
all while protecting people’s privacy.
 Anytime we use personal 
information in a new way — such as 
in creating new digital identity tools 
— we conduct a privacy and data 
protection impact assessment to 
ensure that we are aware of, and can 
minimize, any risks to people’s privacy 
and security. Combined with our 
strong commitment to data ethics, 
this contributes to effective outcomes 
while respecting people’s privacy and 
human rights.

 In addition, we actively participate 
in privacy thought-leadership groups 
and regulatory expert groups around 
the globe, including the EU B2G data-

Privacy Expert Group, and the ENISA 
Working Group on Artificial Intelligence 
and Cybersecurity.Under the GDPR and many privacy 
laws, individuals have a right to 
understand how Mastercard handles 
their data.   
 We updated our Global Privacy 
Notice and our service-specific privacy 
notices to ensure that we are providing 
a clear and simple explanation of 
how we handle someone’s personal 
information. We also regularly review 
and update our comprehensive 
incident-response process to 
investigate and remedy any data 
incident and inform people whether 
the incident might have put their 
privacy at risk. We regularly conduct 
data-breach exercises to test and 
continuously improve the effectiveness 
of our process.
When we work with partners and 
vendors, we contractually obligate 
them to implement strict privacy and 
security controls, including compliance 
with our Privacy by Design principles 
and other rigorous standards and 
practices to ensure the safety and 
security of data.

Ethical and Responsible StandardsIncreased access to goods and information 
brings more exposure to risk. Cybersecurity 
is a top global priority for Mastercard. 
Safety and security are foundational 
principles for every part of our business  
and the innovative technology platforms 
and services we enable. 
That does not mean, however, that 
there should be a trade-off between 
security and convenience.  
 Mastercard is focused on securing 
the entire digital ecosystem. We start 
with Security by Design, marrying 
globally accepted standards with 
leading-edge technology like artificial 
intelligence, biometrics and analytic 
insights. This is how we engender the 
trust of customers and consumers.  
We protect our network against 
threats of every type. Our broad range of security products 
and services is designed to help our 
clients do the same: prevent and 
detect fraud attacks that place 
account holders and customers at 
risk. This approach allows us to be a 
leader, enabling breakthrough security 
solutions and advancing the successful 
deployment of our multilayered 
strategy to protect the ecosystem  
for payments and more.Our multilayered security strategy 
goes far beyond payments, protecting 
infrastructure, devices and data.
EMV Chip and Contactless Technology 
EMV and contactless technology  
are the industry standards for 
secure, face-to-face payments.  
 They’ve become more vital 
than ever as we strive to keep our 
transactions — and ourselves — safe 
and secure during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Over the past 20 years, 
consumers and merchants around 
the world have embraced the security 
improvements and optimized payment 
experiences that these technologies 
bring. Today, 90% of all transactions 
using Mastercard cards are enabled 
with EMV chip technology, providing 
superior protection from counterfeit 
fraud and other attacks. Our EMV 
platform continues to evolve to 
deliver robust security in areas such 
as tokenization, SRC and 3DS and 
will serve as the backbone for future 
payment technologies by enabling safer, 
smarter and more secure transactions.
 Contactless technology provides 
the simplicity of a “tap and go” 
experience along with a platform for 
safe digital payments on smartphones 
and other enabled devices. Usage in 
smart cities and transit systems has sparked change in consumer behavior 
to foster mass adoption of contactless 
functionality. Contactless enablement 
in transit started in London’s transit 
system and has rapidly spread to 
many cities around the world, including 
Singapore, Sydney, Moscow, Kaohsiung, 
Taiwan, Portland and New York. The 
transportation sector has benefitted 
from high-grade security, sophisticated 
transaction risk management and a 
simpler user experience. Transit is now 
fueling increased demand for adjacent 
use cases in parking, tolls, and bike-
share and ride-share services.
 In response to COVID-19, we 
have introduced higher contactless 
no-PIN limits globally to support 
increased use of the safest way to 
pay. Mastercard has focused on 
ensuring that the contactless payment 
experience becomes a cleaner and 
more “touchless” experience. We 
have worked hard with regional 
authorities to quickly introduce higher 
limits on contactless purchases in 
over 75 markets, as of June 2020, so 
that cardholders and shopkeepers 
can make and receive more of their 
payments quickly and securely, without 
the need to enter a PIN or use cash. 
Additionally, we’ve developed guidance 
to ensure the best support for 
merchants, including tips to ensure a 
clean payment experience. Worldwide, 
contactless transactions grew twice as 
fast as non-contactless transactions in 
the grocery and drug store categories 
between February and March 2020.SAFETY AND SECURITY SOLUTIONS Protecting the

89
Ethical and Responsible StandardsTokenization 
We created Mastercard Digital 
Enablement Services (MDES),  
our tokenization platform, in  
2013 to bring the same strong 
cryptographic protection to  
digital transactions that EMV  
chip devices provide in-store.  
 In 2019, we processed 3.96 billion 
transactions through MDES, which is 
three times more than in 2018. This 
increase was achieved by expanding 
our tokenization services to a total of 
more than 2,500 issuers in 65 markets.
 Mastercard has also continued 
to scale MDES for Merchants, 
which uses the same technologies 
to unburden merchants of sensitive 
account data storage, make online 
transactions more user-friendly 
and reduce payment declines. This 
advance has made online payments 
more convenient and reduced declined 
transactions. Since its launch in 2018, 
MDES for Merchants has accounted 
for 93 million payment authorizations
at the end of 2019.Click to Pay 
Mastercard launched Click to Pay —  
a faster, more secure online checkout 
based on the EMV® Secure Remote 
Commerce (SRC) industry standard 
— to our U.S. customers.  
 This technology simplified card 
payment processing across desktop 
and mobile sites, mobile apps and 
connected devices. Like a single 
in-store point-of-sale, Click to Pay 
provides a consistent digital checkout 
experience. When paired with our 
token and authorization standards, 
it delivers the simple, convenient and 
transparent checkout experience 
consumers demand and deserve.Digital Identity 
Our strategy also protects 
digital identities, helping banks 
and merchants identify genuine 
consumers to stop fraud.   
 Digital interactions have evolved 
rapidly with the current pace of 
technological change. This has inevitably 
challenged the notions of identity, trust 
and privacy with which we traditionally 
anchor ourselves in the physical world.
 In March 2019, we announced our 
model for digital identity that is global 
in scope, sensitive to local needs, and 
interoperable between institutions and 
sectors, and ensures that people are the 
guardians of their identity data. At the 
heart of the model are our 10 Principles 
of Digital Identity , which focus on 
data rights, ownership, confidentiality, 
consent, transparency, simplicity, fair 
use, choice, security and inclusion. They 
amount to fundamental individual 
rights: “I own my identity and I control 
my identity data.”
 Our model securely binds a person’s 
identity to their smartphone or other 
device, drawing on biometrics that 
recognize the user’s face, thumbprint 
or voice. Digital identity has the 
potential to unlock new and improved 
experiences for people as they interact 
online with businesses, service providers, 
governments and their communities. 
It also will reduce the risk of fraud and 
identity theft.
 We have built an exceptional roster 
of partners, including Microsoft and 
Samsung, and have begun to preview 
real-world tests of our digital identity 
solution in Australia, North Macedonia 
and other locations.AT THE HEART OF THE MODEL ARE OUR 
10 PRINCIPLES OF DIGITAL IDENTITY, 
WHICH FOCUS ON DATA RIGHTS, 
OWNERSHIP, CONFIDENTIALITY, CONSENT, 
TRANSPARENCY, SIMPLICITY, FAIR USE, 
CHOICE, SECURITY AND INCLUSION.

Ethical and Responsible StandardsThe explosion in the number  
of digital players, applications  
and devices creates connections  
and vulnerabilities.
 Fraudsters are exploiting the weak 
links in new internet of Things devices, 
applications and providers that neglect 
to use stringent network, regulatory 
and security standards and protocols. 
As a result, all stakeholders are at risk 
of attack — even those with strong 
individual fraud protections. Mastercard 
continually invests in cyber and 
network protection to address evolving 
widespread threats to the ecosystem.
Connected Intelligence
We developed Connected Intelligence 
as a comprehensive approach to end-
to-end online payment security.   
 By linking insights across the 
customer journey, we can cut fraud and 
provide a more frictionless experience. 
Connected Intelligence unites a range 
of capabilities such as bot detection, 
biometrics, device intelligence and 
behavioral analytics. Each of these tools 
individually is necessary for any payment 
security strategy, but by linking the 
insights across each layer and applying 
machine learning and AI, we enable a 
smarter fraud prevention strategy. This 
provides both improved security and a 
superior experience from the beginning 
of the consumer journey through to 
authorization and dispute resolution  
at the other end.NuDetect behavioral biometrics 
NuDetect uses biometrics and 
analytics to distinguish authentic 
users from potential fraudsters, 
based on their online, mobile app  
and smartphone interactions.  
 These device-level insights 
enable merchants and financial 
institutions worldwide to improve their 
authorization decisions by mitigating 
fraud before a purchase is processed. 
In 2019, we monitored over 650 billion 
events worldwide, 34% of which we 
identified as high-risk and flagged for 
action to the merchants and financial 
institutions involved. In addition, we 
analyzed global login data to reveal 
that 52% of all login attempts across 
all industries are at high risk of fraud.  
Ethoca 
In April 2019 we acquired Ethoca, 
an award-winning provider of 
collaboration-based intelligence 
and technology solutions that help 
businesses around the world fight 
fraud, prevent disputes and improve 
the customer experience.
 Our solutions provide rich intelligence 
throughout the customer purchase 
journey and bring together real-time 
fraud, customer dispute and purchase 
insights to close costly communication 
gaps between all stakeholders in the 
payment ecosystem.Decision Intelligence 
A key challenge in combating  
digital payments fraud is rapidly  
and accurately distinguishing  
genuine transactions from fraud 
attempts with minimal friction  
for the consumer.  
 Our Decision Intelligence platform 
analyzes our network through artificial 
intelligence to make authorization 
recommendations in real time. The 
platform’s sophisticated modeling 
distills thousands of data points into 
a single decision score that helps 
issuers fine-tune their authorization 
decisions to approve more legitimate 
transactions without increasing risk.
For each transaction:
• We look at transaction fraud 
models and profiles against current, 
widespread fraud monitoring 
activity.
• We assess these attributes based 
on consumer account and device 
information.
• Insights from account spending help 
define the value and engagement of 
the consumer/issuer relationship.Safeguarding

Ethical and Responsible StandardsSafety Net
Cyberattacks have grown 
increasingly sophisticated. In 
response to the growing threat, 
Mastercard’s Safety Net monitors 
transactions continuously at the 
global network level, using artificial 
intelligence to screen hundreds of 
millions of transactions daily.  
 By instantly isolating systemic 
threats and blocking fraudulent 
transactions, Safety Net limits the 
financial and reputational damage  
of large-scale fraud. From 2018 
through 2019, Safety Net blocked  
over $14 billion in potentially  
fraudulent authorization attempts 
from large-scale attacks across all 
transaction channels.
 For issuers, Safety Net monitors 
transactions at the network level to 
identify and mitigate data breaches 
in issuer or processor systems. Safety 
Net’s external layer of defense, 
independent from customer systems, 
uses selective authorization controls 
to block transactions according to 
multiple criteria. Safety Net gradually 
escalates its response to detected 
threats, allowing issuers to better 
manage their fraud strategies and 
consumer impact.
 For acquirers, Safety Net’s 
monitoring criteria and rules can 
evaluate transactions from an  
acquirer perspective, analyzing  
overall activity for a specified acquirer 
and/or cardholder across multiple 
ATMs and merchants globally in order 
to identify large-scale attacks.Threat Scan
Threat Scan assesses issuer 
production authorization networks 
for vulnerabilities to fraud 
by emulating known criminal 
transaction behavior.  
 It highlights vulnerabilities to 
criminal attacks and provides  
network insights that can help  
issuers realize fewer fraud losses  
with a proactive approach to 
fraud prevention. Threat Scan 
offers a pragmatic way for issuers 
to identify gaps in authorization 
security by conducting assessments 
within production versus testing 
environments for a variety of fraud 
types, including counterfeit accounts, 
PIN manipulation, and lost and  
stolen cards.ID Theft Protection
Identity theft can be financially 
and emotionally devastating for 
consumers.  
 ID Theft Protection places 
consumers in control of their identities 
— proactively monitoring and resolving 
identity-theft issues. Using a three-
step process, ID Theft Protection 
safeguards consumers’ most  
valuable asset.
Detect: Uncovers potential identity 
and credit fraud at inception by 
scouring the deepest corners of the 
internet, searching for potentially 
damaging use of consumers’ personal 
and credit report information.
Alert: Provides immediate alerts if 
suspicious activity related to consumer 
identity or credit is found — allowing 
immediate action to be taken to 
minimize damage.
Resolve: Combats identity threats 
quickly with self-service resolution or 
specialist support, helping to restore 
consumer identities and prevent 
further damage.

As a company, we focus on 
collaborating across industries to 
define best practices and standards 
that will be the basis for ensuring 
cyber-trust across our franchise, 
expanding on existing public policy 
and regulatory frameworks.
 Mastercard is working with other 
private-sector leaders to support small 
and medium-size businesses through 
the Cyber Readiness Institute . The 
Institute helps to reduce complexity 
and leverage large-enterprise insights 
at the start of our value chain: smaller 
businesses.
 The Cybersecurity Talent Initiative , 
a public-private partnership formed 
in April 2019, aims to address the U.S. 
government’s immediate deficit of 
qualified cybersecurity experts and 
train a private-sector workforce of 
experienced professionals, all while 
easing student loan debt for its 
participants.
 We formed the CyberPeace 
Institute , a joint development with 
Microsoft and the Hewlett Foundation, 
to strengthen our collective efforts 
in promoting trust and stability and 
de-escalating cyber conflicts globally. 
The Institute focuses on three core 
functions: supporting the most 
vulnerable victims of cyberattacks, 
facilitating research and analysis of 
cyber conflict, and reinforcing positive, 
responsible behavior in cyberspace.

Ethical and Responsible StandardsFusion Center 
Mastercard has built on the success 
of our Fusion Center, a hub for all 
our cyber and physical security 
operations. We have improved our 
response times to become more 
effective during global events, 
natural disasters, and service and 
security incidents.  
 Powered by our global network,  
the Fusion Center monitors trends 
across essential transaction categories 
— ATMs, gas stations, grocery stores 
and pharmacies, restaurants and 
hotels, and home improvement stores 
— to aid crisis response. Through the 
Financial Services Information Sharing 
and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), the 
Federal Emergency Management 
Agency uses our insights to provide 
locally relevant data for emergency 
responders, including the American Red 
Cross, informing their relief efforts. 
We’re also working with the London-
based National Cyber Security Centre 
and other intelligence groups in the 
London area to prevent cash-out 
attacks on ATMs.Mastercard Intelligence Center 
The Mastercard Intelligence Center 
(MCIC) continues to support many of 
our business units by corroborating 
threat intelligence.
 Through MCIC’s established 
intelligence feeds and other sources, 
such as public-private partnerships, 
Mastercard’s Corporate Security  
teams have been able to respond 
quickly to a range of threats, both 
cyber and physical.
 The Fusion Center’s Crisis 
Management team also has 
meaningfully shortened analysis  
time by optimizing the Intelligence 
Center’s feeds and sources. These 
improvements help us move proactively 
and resolve crisis events more quickly  
to minimize their impact. We’ve strengthened our core  
security programs through a  
group of strategic initiatives:
• An enterprise-wide vulnerability 
management program that 
monitors the entire Mastercard 
network. 
• An established Security Operations 
Center (SOC) and Fusion Center. 
• Integrated security engineering that 
customizes foundational security 
practices for various business units. 
• Corporate security monitoring of 
interdepartmental products with a 
global insider threat program. 
• A holistic incident-management 
team that drives a far-reaching, 
consistent threat response. 
• A scalable access-management 
infrastructure that strengthens  
our physical and virtual system-
access controls. Our security program is regularly 
and thoroughly audited by U.S. and 
international agencies, including 
onsite assessments. We also host 
frequent customer assessments 
and penetration tests both onsite 
and remotely. The methodology, and 
our resulting annual certifications, 
satisfy multiple industry-recognized 
frameworks, including those of: 
• The U.S. National Institute of 
Standards and Technology’s (NIST) 
Special Publication 800-115: 
Technical Guide to Information 
Security Testing and Assessment. 
• Open Web Application Security

and to which we can contribute the 
most value. The results of the impact 
assessment informed our first Human 
Rights Statement .The foundational principles of our 
Human Rights Statement include 
using our network to connect people to 
opportunity, encouraging stakeholder 
engagement, promoting good 
governance and respecting individual 
choice within the rule of law. 
 Guided by international human 
rights norms and informed by 
stakeholder engagement, this 
commitment is founded in our belief 
that we must bring human decency 
to everything we do: from how we 
use our technology to empower the 
digital economy to how we interact 
with people. So, while our network is 
the foundation of our business and 
of how we operate, it is our culture of 
decency that fuels our approach to 
human rights, which is why it is both HUMAN RIGHTS
Our commitment to human rights 
starts at the highest level and spans 
the organization. As a technology 
company in the payments industry, 
we see it as our responsibility to 
connect individuals, businesses and 
organizations around the world to 
create opportunities for all. our business strategy and our social 
responsibility to ensure that Mastercard 
uses our network and technology to 
connect people to opportunity.
 Mastercard’s franchise standard 
of use for our services and brand is 
governed by the rule of law. Customers 
must not engage in illegal activity. 
When it comes to transactions 
permissible by law, we respect 
individuals’ right to transact privately 
with others. We review proposals 
to limit acceptance of Mastercard 
products very carefully, so while we 
hold our members to high standards, 
if illegal activity is identified, we work 
with partners to act. This approach 
respects the varying laws in each 
country or locality in which we do 
business, the privacy and independent 
judgment of account holders and the 
role our company plays in the global 
economy. This respect for law creates 
a reliable standard for enforcement 
and maintains a balance between 
protecting people’s human rights and 
protecting people’s right to be free 
from government infringement.

Ethical and Responsible StandardsRESPONSIBLE SOURCING  
AND SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
Guided by our Supplier Code of 
Conduct, Mastercard requires every 
supplier we work with to abide by labor 
laws and avoid all use of forced labor, 
whether prison labor, indentured labor, 
bonded labor or otherwise.
Although we expect each supplier  
to define its own human rights  
policy and approach, we require  
it to be consistent with our  
Supplier Code of Conduct .  
 Mastercard’s full Human Rights 
Statement  has more information  
on our commitment to respecting and 
promoting human rights.  In addition, 
our Supplier Code of Conduct details 
our expectations and requirements 
on child labor, freedom of association, 
compensation and working hours and 
conditions, discrimination, health and 
safety, environmental sustainability, 
and much more. In accordance with the U.K. 
Modern Slavery Act, we have issued 
a statement  outlining the steps 
Mastercard takes to ensure that our 
business and supply chains are free of 
slavery. We are proud to champion the 
principles of these acts, which mirror 
our stance as an ethical company that 
believes in doing well by doing good. 
Our statement on modern slavery and 
human trafficking details the policies 
and provisions we have in place to 
eradicate modern slavery from our 
operations and supply chain.  Just as we value the unique 
contributions and perspectives of our 
global workforce, Mastercard strives 
to spread inclusion and diversity 
throughout our supply chain in the 
United States. We work hard through 
our Supplier Diversity program to 
build strong, ongoing relationships 
with small and diverse businesses. 
These connections reflect our global 
footprint, enrich and strengthen our 
communities and yield powerful, 
innovative products and services. 
 We define diverse suppliers as 
companies owned, operated and 
controlled in majority by one or more 
U.S. citizens who identify as an ethnic 
minority, woman, veteran, LBGT+ or  
person with a disability. In our efforts 
around supplier diversity, we also include 
small businesses that are certified by 
and eligible for assistance from the U.S. 
Small Business Administration.
 We encourage our prime suppliers 
to establish their own diverse supply 
chains. Our Tier 2 reporting program 
requires participating prime suppliers 
to report information and data on their 
use of small and diverse suppliers. Our 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 spending with diverse 
suppliers was more than 10% of our 
total U.S.-based spending.
97
Ethical and Responsible Standards“  The world has changed in 
unprecedented ways and we are 
at a reset moment for society, for 
the economy, and for our planet. 
This is a time for partnership and 
for collective action so we can 
tackle the most pressing social 
and economic issues together, at 
scale, and deliver real impact. This 
report reflects Mastercard’s belief 
that the only sustainable growth is 
inclusive growth — that by bringing 
the full strength of our assets to 
bear we can help everyone reach 
their potential.”
