2019 ESG Disclosure IndexA MESSAGE 
FROM OMAR
The Medtronic Mission is one of the greatest gifts our co-founder 
Earl Bakken gave to Medtronic. It clarifies our purpose and reminds 
us that our foremost priority is to contribute to human welfare. 
Though it was written nearly 60 years ago, it continues to inspire us, 
define our long-term strategy, and guide how we operate as  
a company. At its core, the Mission states that we are a technology company 
that aims to improve outcomes meaningful to patients. T oday we 
are executing on the strongest product pipeline in Medtronic history, 
bringing to market a long list of technology innovations that will, in the 
words of the Mission, alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life for 
millions of people around the world. I’m incredibly pleased to share 
that together with our physician partners, we served a record  
375 million+ patients in FY19 — improving the lives of more than  
two people every second. 
Our Mission also provides an ethical framework for our 90,000+ 
Medtronic employees around the world. It calls upon us to be a 
leader and a partner in finding ways to better serve our communities. 
T o help guide our efforts related to the economic, social, and 
environmental areas where we can make the greatest contributions, 
we have established a Citizenship framework. In this, our FY19 
Integrated Performance Report, we outline our progress within the 
four pillars of our Citizenship framework: Adding Value to Society, 
Promoting Environmental Stewardship, Supporting a Global 
Workforce, and Working Responsibly. 
Before highlighting some of our many notable accomplishments 
in FY19, there are three topics I want to address more deeply. First, 
this year’s Integrated Performance Report debuts the Medtronic 
contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As a global 
company, we support the UN’s commitment to achieve “peace 
and prosperity for people and the planet,” and are focused on the 
specific goals where we can have the greatest impact, including 
ones related to good health, well-being, economic opportunity,  
and partnerships. 
Second, Medtronic values equity, inclusion, and diversity — and aims 
to create an enriching work experience for all employees. In FY19, 
ethnically diverse talent held 22% of leadership positions in the 
United States, surpassing our aspirational goal of 20% or more by 
2020. And 38% of our leadership positions were held by women, on 
track to meet our 2020 aspirational goal of 40% or more. Third, with this year’s report, Medtronic is joining a handful of 
companies who have shared information about pay equity — an 
important component of the UN’s goal on economic opportunity 
and tightly aligned with T enet 5 of our Mission, which calls on us to 
“recognize the personal worth of all employees” — regardless of 
gender , race, or ethnicity. A comprehensive analysis we conducted 
in FY19 showed that our global pay equity between genders was 
99% — and 100% in certain countries, including the United States. 
We also conducted an ethnic diversity analysis in the United States, 
which included all genders, and found that for every $1.00 that 
white employees with a certain job title earned, ethnically diverse 
employees earned $0.99. While we are pleased with these results,  
I assure you that our journey won’t stop until we ensure and sustain 
100% pay equity for all.
Further , I want to highlight some other notable accomplishments  
in FY19. We:
 Delivered strong financial results, achieving $30.6 billion in 
revenue and $5.9 billion in free cash flow.
 Invested $2.3 billion in research and development to advance 
our innovation pipeline. This included the costs of 279+ ongoing 
clinical studies. 
 Increased healthcare capacity and access by investing $142 
million in training for more than 83,000 medical professionals, and 
$28.6 million in patient education.
 Continued our commitment to ethics in sales and marketing 
by reaching more than 21,000 marketing and sales employees 
(97% of employees in these roles) through expanded product-
promotion trainings.
4 Directed 24% of our U.S. supplier spend to small and diverse 
companies, reinforcing our commitment to a diverse  
supply chain.
 Continued to shift our philanthropic activities toward programs 
with measurable impact on improving health outcomes for 
underserved populations. Our philanthropic contributions total 
more than $1 billion since 2003, including our support of the 
Medtronic Foundation.
 Continued to reduce energy use, emissions, regulated waste, 
and water use. Energy projects completed in FY19 will provide 
Medtronic an estimated $4.3 million in operational cost savings 
— reinforcing the business case for environmental responsibility. 
In FY20, we will launch new environmental goals, committing us to 
further reduce our footprint by 2025. 
Since joining Medtronic over eight years ago, I have been truly 
honored to lead this organization and its team of highly talented, 
dedicated employees. Looking ahead, I recently announced my 
intention to retire as CEO at the end of FY20 and the board of 
directors named Geoff Martha as the next Medtronic CEO.   
Geoff has the ability, judgement, values, and strategic vision to 
propel our company to new heights into the future. In closing, we are proud of the progress we have made to date and 
are excited about the future, but we know there is still much work to 
be done. Not only have we built the strongest product pipeline in the 
company’s history, but we are also committed to lead the industry in 
all that we do and the way that we do it — focusing on environmental 
and social responsibilities, while also delivering on profitability. And 
most importantly, we will continue to extend the reach of Medtronic 
to impact even more patients around the globe — furthering our 
Mission to use technology to alleviate pain, restore health, and 
extend life.

profitability with environmental and social responsibilities. We must be held accountable for what we do and the way we do it.  
Our Material 
Issues
We activate our commitment 
to good corporate citizenship 
through a continuous cycle 
of foresight, planning, and 
reporting on our most 
significant sustainability issues. 
By conducting regular reviews 
of our sustainability strategies 
and priorities, we are able to 
stay ahead of emerging risks 
and opportunities. The review 
process informs planning and 
operations across our business, 
extending into our supply chain 
and the way we design and make 
our products. It ensures that we 
drive innovation and efficiency 
with deep awareness of our 
responsibility to people  
and planet.SUST AINABILITY 
PRIORITIES & 
STRA TEGIES
We focus on the issues that:
 Have the potential to 
significantly impact our 
business growth, finances, or 
reputation
 Are important to our 
stakeholders
 Are aligned with our Mission to 
alleviate pain, restore health, 
and extend life for people 
around the world
This analysis informs our 
sustainability priorities  
and strategies:
 Access to care — we work with 
health systems around the 
world, sharing technologies, 
services, resources, and 
expertise to remove barriers to 
affordable treatment of 
chronic diseases  Product stewardship — 
we aspire to minimize the 
life cycle footprint of our 
products and packaging 
through innovative design
 Ethics in sales and 
marketing — we earn and 
maintain the trust of our 
stakeholders through the 
responsible marketing, 
communication, and 
promotion of our products 
and services
 Supply chain responsibility 
— we collaborate with our 
suppliers to develop long-
term relationships that 
improve product quality, 
promote responsible 
business practices, and 
support small and  
diverse businesses Product quality — we 
ensure that our products 
and services clearly meet the 
highest standards of safety 
and reliability
We explain our approach to 
these and other material issues 
throughout this report and 
in our 2019 ESG Disclosure 
Index.
These five areas have guided 
the focus of our sustainability 
program since FY15. In FY19, 
we refreshed our materiality 
assessment and are using 
the outputs to define our 
performance and disclosure 
strategies for the coming years.12HOW WE ENGAGE  
WITH OUR ST AKEHOLDERS
We do more when we work together with others. Engagement and collaboration enable us to share our aspirations and challenges, be held 
accountable, and achieve positive outcomes for patients more effectively.

RISK AND  
OPPORTUNITIES
In the face of social, political, 
and environmental change, we 
constantly monitor emerging 
issues and agendas. We work 
to anticipate, adapt, and 
respond to evolving trends, 
risks, and opportunities through 
innovation and partnership.
Managing risk
Our key risks occur in the 
following areas:
Climate risk and resilience
 We manage transitional risk 
through routine monitoring  
of carbon regulations, 
including carbon taxes, 
and proactively installing 
renewable and alternate 
energy sources as they 
become more cost-effective 
and readily available.  
 Failure to meet customer 
sustainability requirements
 We aim to meet or exceed 
customer requirements on 
all aspects of sustainability, 
including product quality, 
access to healthcare, 
environmental impacts, labor 
practices, and responsible 
supply management.
 Our Global Human Rights 
Program and Responsible 
Supply Management Program 
ensure a consistent approach 
to key sustainability issues 
across our operations  
and supply chain.
Risk of reputational damage 
from unethical behavior
 We regularly train employees 
to comply with our Code of 
Conduct, and we have clear 
processes for reporting and  
acting on ethical concerns. 
Additional compliance 
training for employees in 
certain roles further mitigates  
the risk of corruption  
and misconduct.We include more detail about 
our most significant business 
risks in our 2019 Form 10-K  
and 10-Q filings with the  
U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission.
Creating opportunities
Beyond avoiding negative 
impact, we also seek to generate 
value from sustainable business 
practices, in line with our Mission 
and values. Our opportunity 
areas include:
 Leading the industry in 
meaningful innovation and 
value-based healthcare  
The speed of global 
technological and societal 
change is faster than ever . 
This evolution presents 
a significant opportunity 
for us to identify emerging 
solutions and develop 
innovative, effective, value-
driven products and business 
models that improve lives.15 Forming bold, impactful 
partnerships  
Collaboration with a range of 
national and local partners 
enables us to accelerate 
global access to lifesaving 
therapies. Our partners 
challenge us to think 
differently and engage in new 
ways of working. 
 Driving business efficiency 
As we increase efficiency 
throughout our own 
operations, we extend this 
positive impact by sharing our 
learning and approach with 
others, including business 
partners and suppliers.Business continuity and 
crisis management
Unexpected events — such 
as natural disasters, extreme 
weather , and sudden power 
outages — can disrupt our 
operations or supply chain on 
short notice. Our preparedness 
and resilience practices protect 
our ability to do business 
sustainably and are of interest to 
our stakeholders. Our Business 
Continuity Management 
program helps us to plan for the 
risk of unexpected events, with a 
focus on:
 Business continuity — 
ensuring that we can 
continue to operate and  
meet demand in adverse 
circumstances Crisis management and 
mobilization — coordinating 
responses in crisis situations
 Emergency response — 
keeping people and assets 
safe and minimizing 
environmental impact  
in emergencies
 IT response and  
recovery — responding 
quickly to technological 
failures and reinstating 
affected infrastructure
We also provide philanthropic 
support during natural disasters;

 Submitting environmental data to CDP annually17We live in a time of unprecedented potential, where the possibilities of technology have never been greater . Still, the world is faced with pressing 
environmental and social challenges that require urgent action. These challenges cannot be solved by organizations acting alone. Now is the 
time to come together — businesses, governments, and international organizations — to create change where it is needed the most.
We support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve “peace and prosperity for people and the planet.” We are focused on 
the goals where we can have the largest impact:

18SDG 3: Good health and well-being 
As a leading global medical technology company, we have the expertise, innovation, and commitment to partnership needed to help improve the 
health and well-being of people around the world. These skills are pivotal to addressing the healthcare challenges facing us today. 
Globally, 32 million people died in 2016 due to cardiovascular disease, cancer , diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease. For decades, Medtronic has 
dedicated much of its time and talent to finding solutions to noncommunicable illnesses such as these. We, along with our peers, governments, 
and other organizations, intend to tackle this alarming statistic by expanding the affordability and accessibility of care. The table below describes 
some of the ways Medtronic is leading this transition.
SDG MEDTRONIC CONTRIBUTION
 Medtronic continues to innovate and partner to reduce premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases:
 We served more than 75 million patients in FY19. 
  We invest in R&D, innovation hubs, and clinical trials that drive new therapies, services, and solutions for noncommunicable diseases.
  We expand access to healthcare through our care-delivery initiatives such as Integrated Health Solutions, Medtronic Care Management Services, and 
Patient Access Acceleration.
  We invested $142 million in healthcare capacity building and training for medical professionals in FY19, reaching 83,000 people.  
  We collaborate with global product donation partners to distribute Medtronic products to nonprofit organizations and in-country clinics to meet the 
needs of underserved groups — in FY19, we donated $9.2 million in products.
   We invested $28.6 million in patient outreach and education.
 We are strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse through education and the advancement of key therapies:
  We collaborate with others in pain management to broaden therapy awareness and advocacy, deliver innovation, and advance clinical and economic 
evidence in favor of device-delivered pain therapies as an alternative to opioids.
We develop new business models and partner with others around the world to achieve universal access to healthcare:
  Our Government Affairs team and executive leadership champion universal health coverage. In September 2019, Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak chaired 
a panel at the UN High-Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage. 
 We invest in infrastructure in emerging markets through our hub-and-spoke model.19We also contribute to SDG goals aligned to social and environmental progress, including equality, decent work, innovation, responsible 
consumption and production, and partnerships.

TO SOCIETY
The full size and reach of our company help us 
contribute to the health of communities around the 
world. We achieve this through our efforts to expand 
access to high-quality healthcare, give back through 
philanthropic initiatives, and support local economies 
through our business operations.21Our business was founded on innovation. T oday, we continue to develop 
new solutions to global healthcare challenges. We focus particularly 
on the treatment of chronic, noncommunicable diseases, including 
conditions that disproportionately affect people in emerging markets.
Our Mission drives us to make our products available to the people 
who need them — whoever and wherever they are. Universal access to 
healthcare is a global priority, with millions of people unable to receive 
essential treatment. We develop new business models and partner with 
others around the world to reduce barriers to access and affordability. TECHNOLOGY  
INNOVA TION
As the pace of technological change accelerates, we anticipate 
and invest in high-potential technologies. We develop promising 
discoveries into effective treatments and make these available to 
the patients who need them most.
The future of healthcare will be connected, precise,  
and personalized. Our strong pipeline ensures that we will stay  
at the forefront of our evolving industry.

ACCESS
Adding  
Business Value
 
Business growth is intrinsically linked to patient access and 
affordability. This drives us to create new healthcare models 
based on value, efficiency, and outcomes. Increasing access 
also requires us to invest in infrastructure development, therapy 
awareness, and specialized physician training.
In this way, we serve society by widening access for underserved 
communities — and we serve our business by growing  
our markets. In FY19, Medtronic products and services

With a 40-plus-year history of developing 
innovative medical devices that have been 
shown to alleviate pain in different disease 
states, we recognize that we have a role to 
play in disrupting this epidemic. No single 
entity can solve America’s opioid and pain 
crisis alone, which is why we are working in 
collaboration to address the unmet needs  
of pain patients .

OUR ROLE IN DISRUPTING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC
The opioid epidemic has had a devastating impact across the 
United States, and public officials have declared the epidemic 
“the worst drug crisis in American history.” At the same time, 
the ongoing public health problem of pain management 
constitutes a crisis of its own. Despite availability of effective 
pain treatments, barriers to achieving adequate pain relief 
remain for many Americans.1
Medtronic Pain Therapies is working to disrupt the opioid 
crisis in collaboration with patients, providers, regulators, 
elected officials, patient advocacy groups, and employers. 
We are raising awareness of alternatives to conventional pain 
medication and researching clinical and economic evidence for 
their effectiveness.
For example, the Embrace T argeted Drug Delivery study is 
evaluating intrathecal2 morphine as an alternative to systemic 
opioids for the treatment of chronic, intractable, non-
malignant primary back pain with or without leg pain.  
The study will:
 Follow patients who wean completely from all oral opioids 
and have a positive response to intrathecal drug trial
 Assess pain control and opioid-related side effects at  
six months following a route of delivery change to intrathecal 
preservative-free morphine sulfate

CASE STUDY
PA TENTS FOR HUMANITY  
In FY19, the U.S. Patent and T rademark Office named our 
hemodialysis system, currently under development, as one of 
its 2018 “Patents for Humanity” award winners. The program 
honors innovators who create game-changing technology to 
meet global humanitarian challenges.
T oday’s hemodialysis systems — used to treat chronic 
kidney disease — require costly infrastructure such as water 
purification facilities. They are often only available at urban 
hospitals and clinics far from many patients. Our goal is to 
design a portable hemodialysis system that is significantly  
smaller and that requires 75% less water than traditional 
systems. We intend to address the biggest barriers to chronic 
kidney disease care — especially in emerging markets, where 
the need is great.Launching new products

Focusing on value may 
reduce barriers to access by 
demonstrating positive impact 
and enabling payment for 
treatments to be spread over 
time, contingent on patient 
outcomes. This financial model 
rewards hospitals for providing 
care that results in better 
patient outcomes, by focusing 
on cost relative to outcomes, 
rather than on cost alone.
Our Global VBHC Council — 
comprising leaders from  
across our business divisions, 
regions, and functions —  
steers our approach to  
value-based models.Systems take time to 
change. We advocate and 
collaborate with others to

Value-based healthcare
T raditional healthcare models 
involve payment by volume of 
product or therapy. This can 
lead to unsustainable healthcare 
systems where limited resources 
may be spent on ineffective 
or expensive treatment. We 
continue to advocate for a shift 
to value-based healthcare 
(VBHC).DEVELOPING

aim to price our products in a 
fair and reasonable manner , in 
the context of local healthcare 
system structures and 
market dynamics. T o increase 
affordability and value, we:
 Offer a variety of pricing 
models, including volume

MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS  
BY EXPLORING NEW APPLICA TIONS  
Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) — 
including implantable defibrillators and pacemakers 
— can be lifesaving for people with chronic heart 
conditions. But infections occur in 1% to 4% of all CIED 
implantations, leading to a higher risk of mortality and 
increased treatment costs.
The Medtronic TYRX™ Absorbable Antibacterial 
Envelope is the only fully absorbable antibacterial 
envelope available for CIEDs. It contains two powerful 
antibiotics and has been shown to reduce infection by 
70% to 100% in high-risk patients. 
As of FY19, it is available in 55 countries, with more than  
350,000 patients treated worldwide and projected net 
savings of $507 per patient.5   
In addition to CIEDs, the TYRX Envelope is cleared for  
use with implantable neurostimulators, and we are 
exploring additional applications for the technology, 
which would enable access to its benefits in a wider range 
of clinical settings.T ransforming  
healthcare systems
T reating patients in need is 
the priority for any healthcare 
system. In the midst of everyday 
healthcare delivery, it can be 
challenging for providers to 
focus on improving value, 
access, and quality.
 Medtronic Integrated Health

CASE STUDY
REDUCING WAIT TIMES FOR CARDIAC PA TIENTS 
AWAITING CA THETERIZA TION
Eastern Health, the largest regional health authority in 
Newfoundland and Labrador , Canada, operates the province’s  
only cardiac catheter lab. Many patients with heart conditions 
requiring catheterization must travel long distances to get there, 
sometimes by air ambulance.
Until recently, difficulties with scheduling and utilization frequently 
led to lengthy wait times for patients and uncertainty over when 
they would have their procedures. The impact was felt across the 
province, as patients waiting for catheterization took up beds in 
other hospitals. 
In December 2017, Eastern Health began a collaboration with 
Medtronic IHS with the aim of developing a workable long-term 
solution to wait times. Following a review of issues and goals, 
development of an improvement framework, and work on internal 
culture, Eastern Health launched a new strategy in October 2018. 
The effects became evident within weeks:
 By the end of the year , utilization in the catheter lab had  
increased by 37%.
 By March 2019, the outpatient waitlist had been reduced by 15%.
 In January 2019, the province-wide average wait time from date 
of acceptance to date of procedure was down by an average of 
56.5% (compared with FY18).CASE STUDY
ENABLING EFFICIENT RESPONSES  
TO CARDIAC EMERGENCIES
Tijuana, Mexico, has a population of more than 1.6 million people — 
most of whom are not covered by insurance. As a result, the Red  
Cross responds to 98% of emergency calls. Around 3,000 calls  
each year relate to brain and heart diseases. T o increase treatment 
capacity and facilitate efficient response to these calls, Medtronic  
IHS partnered with the Red Cross to:
 Open a state-of-the-art catheter lab
 Equip 13 ambulances with Cardiac Alert — a fast-track  
assessment tool that ensures a diagnosis is available by the time  
the patient arrives for treatment

chronic, co-morbid conditions. 
MCMS programs combine care 
management services and 
patient engagement solutions 
with data analytics and reporting:
 Care management services 
MCMS disease management 
programs, clinical decision 
support technology, and 
patient outreach services 
help escalate at-risk patients. 
These tools support 
healthcare professionals, 
payers, and post-acute care 
providers to make stronger 
clinical decisions.
 Patient engagement 
solutions  
Patient platforms, disease 
management programs,  
and biometric peripheral 
devices help to optimize 
patient experience, 
supporting individuals to stay 
engaged in the program and 
securely share their health 
information daily. Harnessing automation 
and connectivity
Much of the care for patients 
with complex, chronic,  
co-morbid conditions happens 
outside of the hospital setting. 
The increasing use of  
connected devices to monitor 
health is enabling access to  
near real-time patient data 
through remote monitoring, 
wearables, and telehealth. 
Because of its ability to  
improve patient outcomes and 
reduce administrative costs, 
connected health is likely to  
play a significant role in 
increasing the value of future 
healthcare models. 
Medtronic Care Management 
Services (MCMS) works with 
health systems, post-acute 
care providers, and health plans 
to provide remote monitoring 
and care management services 
for patients with complex,  Data analytics  
and reporting  
Advanced data analytics 
support healthcare 
professionals to assess 
patient cohorts, discover 
insights about at-risk 
patients, and act faster on 
potential health risks.
These programs are designed 
to help patients get involved 
in their care at home and 
support provider care teams to 
monitor patient health data and 
intervene if needed. 
MCMS has a strong legacy  
of more than 20 years in 
telehealth. During this time,  
the MCMS team has spent  
7 million telehealth months 
monitoring health data, 
interacting with patients, and 
supporting care teams in clinical 
decision-making.Operating in resource-
constrained regions
Lack of resources and 
connectivity are often barriers to 
effective, sustainable healthcare 
systems. Our hub-and-spoke 
model offers a solution. A 
state-of-the-art hospital (the 
hub) connects with healthcare 
centers in surrounding 
communities to create a well-
defined patient pathway (the 
spokes). A coordinated care 
approach enables convenient 
access to diagnostics and 
referrals through the spokes, 
with highly complex treatments 
and procedures available at the 
hub when needed. 30Reaching underserved populations
Healthcare needs are complex for people living with chronic 
conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. Limited access to 
appropriate care compounds these challenges. Medtronic Labs 
works to expand access to healthcare for underserved patients, 
families, and communities across the world, with a focus on financially 
sustainable solutions that maximize social impact. 
Medtronic Labs designs healthcare delivery models that integrate 
digital and product technologies across the care continuum. 
Partnerships — with local technology entrepreneurs, healthcare 
providers, NGOs, governments, and other stakeholders — amplify 
impact and scale.
Medtronic Labs’ solutions are built upon five principles: 
 Design with and for communities to address local barriers across 
the care continuum 
 Employ evidence-based practices and protocols for 
uncompromised clinical excellence 
 Address the social determinants at the root of poor health
 Integrate digital and product technologies for high-tech,  
high-touch models of care
 Innovate operational models that enable efficiency at scale

Advocating for  
increased access
We engage with governments 
and other organizations to 
advocate for improved access 
to essential treatment by 
removing barriers and creating 
opportunities. For example, for 
the past three years we have 
been working in Chile to expand 
access to deep brain stimulation 
(DBS) — a treatment for 
conditions such as Parkinson’s 
and dystonia.
Chile had no short- or long-term 
financial coverage for DBS, as 
well as a limited provision and 
lack of awareness of treatment 
options. We undertook 
sustained engagement 
and partnership with key 
stakeholders — including 
developing an awareness-
raising campaign and a financial 
support program for patients. In FY19, for example, we began 
providing patients with access 
to lifesaving dialysis treatment 
through our new partnership 
with Angelica Medical Suppliers 
and the Kenyan government. 
Before the partnership, Kenya 
had just two dialysis clinics, both 
in Nairobi — a two-day drive 
from some regions. In a country 
where 30% of the population 
lives on less than $2 per day, 
the $90 cost of each session is 
prohibitive for many.
Through the partnership, 
Angelica set up 25 dialysis 
clinics at county hospitals, while 
Medtronic provided training 
to more than 400 nurses and 
60 biomedical engineers. The 
Kenyan government is funding 
the cost of equipment over 
time, based on measurable 
performance. This affordable, 
sustainable solution offers new 
hope for people suffering with 
renal disease who previously had 
limited access to care. PARTNERSHIPS

Public-Private 
Partnerships
Public-Private Partnerships 
(PPP) offer significant 
opportunities to increase 
patient access to our products 
and services in new markets. 
Guided by the Medtronic PPP 
council, we actively pursue 
partnerships around the world 
that address gaps in healthcare. 
These PPPs tend to be longer-
term contracts that enable us 
to create sustainable, scalable 
projects and programs in four 
key areas:
 R&D

 Health system strengthening
 
 
 Working within  
local contexts
Using our Patient Access 
Acceleration (PAA) approach, 
we quantify treatment needs 
in a specific location before 
formulating strategies to 
tackle barriers to access. 
By combining data from 
thousands of PAA assessments, 
we improve planning and 
reduce risks associated with 
future investments in market 
development.
We partner with hospitals 
around the world to deliver 
our Patient Access Insights 
(PAI) consulting service. PAI

CASE STUDY
ELEVA TING THE ROLE OF  
COMMUNITY HEAL TH WORKERS
By 2030, a global shortfall of 18 million health workers is expected.11 
With demand currently outpacing supply, more and better-trained 
health workers are needed in and outside of clinics.
The 72nd World Health Assembly further emphasized the global 
significance of this issue by passing a resolution on opportunities 
and challenges for community healthcare workers delivering 
primary healthcare.
Because patient and healthcare worker voices need to be heard 
in this global conversation, in FY19, the Medtronic Foundation 
engaged in a listening exercise to better understand its potential 
role in addressing this emerging crisis. It led regional design-
thinking workshops and asked patients, national and local 
policymakers, and those on the front lines of care: “How can we 
solve tomorrow’s healthcare issues, starting now?”
The messages from nearly 100 listening sessions across four 
continents were clear:
 Develop radical self-care solutions to address the rise in chronic 
conditions.
 Be patient-centric by engaging the communities most in need.
11  World Health Organization Biennium report 2016-2017. Meet people where they are to get to better outcomes.
 T rain more health workers who are compensated and valued, in 
order to deliver services at scale.
In response, the Medtronic Foundation is increasing its focus on 
supporting and strengthening healthcare workers. 39
In FY19, the Medtronic Foundation developed and refined its impact 
assessment framework to ensure that future funding maximizes 
positive outcomes. The Medtronic Foundation tested the framework 
during the selection of a small number of Opportunity Grant partners. 
The focus was on testable, scalable solutions that address healthcare 
efficiency and produce demonstrable positive outcomes. 
From nearly 200 applicants, 7 were selected to receive 1-year grants. 
All partner organizations participated in a Medtronic Foundation-
led Learning Collaborative, to share lessons across markets and 
approaches to improve healthcare efficiency for underserved 
populations. 
The process helped Medtronic Foundation hone our framework for 
measuring and delivering social impact in a financially sustainable 
manner , through local organizations. 
In FY20, the framework will be rolled out across all Medtronic 
Foundation activities to aid decision-making about current and future 
partnerships.

$5,000 cap on employee philanthropic donations). In FY19, the 
fund distributed $1.38 million to impacted employees. 
In FY19, we supported ongoing recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and in 
Santa Rosa, California, following the hurricane and wildfires in these 
locations in FY18. We also responded to several disasters across 
the globe, including the drought in Australia, wildfires in Greece, and 
flooding in India.

CASE STUDY
SUPPORTING EMPLOYEE AND COMMUNITY 
RESILIENCE DURING TIMES OF CRISIS 
In FY19, a number of crises — including Hurricane Maria, 
California wildfires, and others — affected Medtronic employees, 
our operations, and the communities we serve. These events 
devastated neighborhoods, businesses, and infrastructure. 
In each instance, Medtronic crisis management teams activated 
our response plans as soon as the potential impact became 
apparent. We started by verifying that all employees were safe 
and accounted for , and then worked to assess and support their 
needs, alongside those of the communities.
But initial support is not enough. The effects of a natural disaster 
are felt long after the event has passed. In FY19, the Medtronic 
Foundation pledged $1 million to help improve the health of 
people and communities affected by natural disasters and other 
crisis events. It continues to work closely with local nonprofit 
organizations and employees to assess how to best support 
ongoing relief and recovery efforts.Continuing relief efforts in Santa Rosa 
The North Bay wildfires in October 2017 were some of the 
most destructive in California state history. They claimed 
44 lives and burned more than 6,000 homes. As the slow 
process of recovery continues, providing affordable housing 
is essential.
In Sonoma County, Medtronic and the Medtronic Foundation 
have partnered with the local chapter of nonprofit Habitat 
for Humanity to provide new homes for survivors. As part  
of this initiative:
 Medtronic provided land for housing at its  
Fountaingrove campus.
 The Medtronic Foundation donated $100,000 to help 
fund construction.
 Habitat for Humanity Sonoma County is building eight 
compact houses for fire survivors. 
 Medtronic employees and other volunteers help to ready 
the homes to live in.
This collaborative effort is a small but important part of  
the overall goal to rebuild a community in the aftermath  
of disaster .
 42As a leading global medical 
technology company, 
our priority is to improve 
healthcare for all. By doing 
this, our business plays an 
even greater role in improving 
lives — not just for patients, 
but also for our employees 
and the communities in which 
we operate. Our financial 
success means we can 
continue to make important 
economic contributions 
to society by creating jobs, 
contributing taxes, and 
making capital investments.
Financial performance
In FY19, we earned revenue 
of $30.6 billion. Our revenue-
growth strategy starts with 
executing on our technology 
pipeline, while our growth 
accelerators, Globalization and Economic Value, enhance 
our growth profile, expand 
our markets, and increase our 
competitiveness.
Our emerging market revenue 
grew 13% on a comparable 
constant currency basis in FY19 
compared to FY18. We were 
able to drive growth in these 
key markets by optimizing 
our distribution channels, 
developing our public and private 
partnerships, and localizing 
our research and development 
(R&D) and manufacturing.

Capital investments and operating expenses are required for 
our continued success and growth, and they also support local 
economies. The wages and taxes we pay directly benefit individuals 
and communities, while our business with suppliers leads to indirect 
benefits by allowing them to hire and pay additional workers. 
Acquisitions and divestitures
Our aim is to offer a broad range of therapies to restore patients’ 
health and extend lives. We primarily achieve this through continued 
investment in R&D but also through acquisitions. We pursue 
acquisitions that align with our Mission and bring new technology, 
strategic skills, capabilities, and expertise to Medtronic. Notable 
acquisitions during FY19 include: 
 EPIX Therapeutics — expands our portfolio of tools to treat 
patients with cardiac arrhythmias
 Mazor Robotics — strengthens our position as a global leader in 
technologies for spine surgery
 Nutrino Health — enhances our ability to improve clinical 
outcomes for people with diabetes 
When appropriate, we use divestitures to more closely align our 
product and therapy portfolio and business activities with our 
strategic priorities. In FY19, we had no significant divestitures.

AND ENERGY USE
Compared to our FY13 baseline, in FY19 we consumed 26% less 
energy and generated 38% fewer GHG emissions per million dollars 
revenue. Our global energy strategy reduces emissions through 
conservation, renewable energy sourcing, and onsite generation.
Emissions
In FY19, our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 289,000 metric 
tons (MT) carbon dioxide equivalent, a nearly 4% decrease from 
the prior year . We produced 9.5 MT of emissions per million dollars 
revenue in FY19 compared to 10.2 MT per million dollars revenue in 
FY18. We achieved this reduction by implementing 133 conservation 
projects, generating 75,500 MWh of energy onsite and sourcing 
renewables for 35% of our total energy needs.

CASE STUDY
REBUILDING IN 
PUERTO RICO AFTER 
HURRICANE MARIA
When Hurricane Maria  
hit Puerto Rico in 
September 2017, a solar-
powered system at our 
Juncos site, completed  
in January 2017, was  
largely destroyed by  
the Category 5 storm. 
After the storm, only  
20% of the installation  
was usable. Understanding 
the need for renewable 
energy, we are reinvesting 
in the project and 
rebuilding the structure 
to withstand hurricane 
conditions, making 
Medtronic even more 
resilient to severe weather . 52
Medtronic proactively manages 
hazardous waste to prevent 
negative environmental 
impacts and reduce liability 
risks. Prior to contracting 
vendors, we assess their 
waste management process 
against our expectations and 
requirements. We participate in 
programs to audit and assess 
vendors for best practices in the 
waste management field. We 
monitor vendors throughout our 
relationship to ensure that they 
meet or exceed our standards. 
In FY19, we produced  
3,005 MT of regulated waste,  
a 3% decrease from the prior 
year . In FY19, we produced  
98 MT per billion dollars revenue 
of regulated waste, compared 
to 105 MT per billion dollars 
revenue in FY18. Innovative 
operational solutions and waste in FY19, compared to  
757 MT per billion dollars revenue 
in FY18. Our recycling rate  
was 54%. 
Our Strategic Meetings 
Management group partners 
with employees to reduce 
the environmental impact of 
Medtronic meetings and events. 
We encourage organizers to 
focus on 20 actions that reduce 
energy, water , and waste impacts 
while providing cost savings. 
For example, waste initiatives in 
FY19 included going paperless, 
eliminating disposable products, 
and organizing food donation 
and compost programs. 
Throughout the year , we saved 
an estimated $280,000 by 
implementing more sustainable 
practices at U.S. meetings  
and events. REDUCING WASTE 
AND WA TER USE
When we manage our waste 
and water use, we reduce 
our environmental impact, 
operational costs, and risk.  
Our FY19 performance shows a 
33% reduction in non-regulated 
waste and an 8% reduction 
in regulated waste per billion 
dollars revenue, compared to 
our FY13 baseline.
Reducing waste
In FY19, we implemented a new 
recycling process to transition 
some regulated waste streams 
into non-regulated waste. We 
also improved waste reporting 
across our global sites. As a 
result of these efforts, our non-
regulated waste increased 3% 
compared to the previous year . 
We generated 837 MT per billion 
dollars revenue of non-regulated partnerships are bringing 
Medtronic closer to our  
FY20 goal to reduce regulated 
waste by 10%. 
The Medtronic Ireland Galway, 
Parkmore, facility conducts 
research and development for 
our global Cardiac and Vascular 
business. It utilizes chemicals 
for the manufacture and testing 
of products and is one of our 
largest producers of regulated 
waste. In FY19, the site reduced 
its total regulated waste by  
24.5 MT by optimizing chemical 
use and identifying secondary 
uses for regulated waste 
streams. The effort resulted  
in a 34% reduction in the site’s 
total waste generation.533,0053,0993,150

53Our Plainfield, Indiana, site services advanced-energy devices for our surgical innovations business and has 
historically generated large volumes of regulated waste. In FY19, Medtronic formed a partnership with social 
enterprise RecycleForce — a local nonprofit that provides recycling services as well as training and work 
experience for formerly incarcerated people. In its first year , the partnership helped Plainfield recycle 30% 
more regulated material. 
Reducing water use
Water scarcity is a growing global concern, and we are preparing our business for a time when water is less 
readily available. Though medical device manufacturing is generally not water-intensive, we strive to be 
water-efficient and to understand our water risk. 
In FY19, we conducted a water risk assessment of our sites that use more than 4 million gallons annually. 
The results revealed four locations in the Americas that are at an elevated risk for both water scarcity 
and stress and a total of 10 locations globally that are at risk for either scarcity or stress. We shared the FY19 Performance54
results with operations leaders to integrate the results into long-term 
business planning. Moving forward, we will perform a water scarcity 
analysis every two years. 
In FY19, our water use was 2,109,000 cubic meters (m3), a 4% 
decrease from the prior year . In FY19, our water use was 69 m3 per 
million dollars revenue, compared to 75 m3 per million dollars revenue 
in FY18. 
At our North Haven, Connecticut, site in FY19, we conducted an 
intensive engineering program to identify and implement water 
conservation projects. By upgrading the cooling towers, reverse 
osmosis system, and other equipment, the site is projected to save  
an estimated 6.5 million gallons of water , 12% of the site’s annual  
total usage.

STEWARDSHIP
Patient safety is our absolute 
priority in manufacturing medical 
devices. This means we focus on 
quality, sterility, and compliance. 
Increasingly, in line with our 
customers’ priorities, we are also 
working to reduce the lifecycle 
footprint of Medtronic products 
and packaging. 
Regulatory compliance
Medtronic scientists and 
engineers follow EHS guidelines 
when developing new products. 
Our standardized approach 
helps us meet regulatory 
requirements for products 
and product communications 
aligned with:
 California Proposition 65 
(required product disclosures 
are available at www.
medtronic.com/caprop65)
 E.U. Directive on Restriction 
of Hazardous Substances 
(RoHS) E.U. Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorization, and Restriction 
of Chemicals (REACH)
 E.U. Medical Device Directive 
(MDD) and Active Implantable 
Medical Device Directive
In FY19, we streamlined the way 
Medtronic manages materials  
of concern (MOC). We revised 
our existing Chemical Risk 
and Hazard Policy to create a 
formal MOC Policy. We also 
established a companywide 
MOC assessment procedure 
and published an MOC list. This 
approach prepares us for the 
forthcoming E.U. Medical Device 
Regulation (effective May 2020) 
and helps us address evolving 
customer requirements. 
Medtronic had zero instances 
of noncompliance with product 
labeling or environmental laws  
in FY19. 55
evaluate packaging attributes 
and calculate the environmental 
impact of design decisions. We 
are also assessing our systems 
for tracking and reporting 
packaging waste reduction.
In FY19, Medtronic received 
an Institute of Packaging 
Professionals Ameristar award 
for innovations in our SC and 
NC Euphora™ medical product 
packaging. We designed the 
packaging to be easier and 
safer to use, We also reduced 
more than 20 metric tons (MT) 
of paper waste by shifting to 
electronic instructions for use.Product footprint and 
circular economy
We are reducing the life cycle 
impact of our products through 
packaging and circular economy 
initiatives. Our products 
consume relatively low energy, 
and safety requirements  
prevent us from reducing  
energy requirements. 
One opportunity to reduce 
product waste is secondary 
packaging — the packaging 
that protects products without 
coming in direct contact 
with them. The Medtronic 
Sustainable Packaging Working 
Group champions our efforts 
to integrate environmental 
factors into the product 
development process. In 
FY19, the group developed a 
product sustainability packaging 
scorecard and organized a 
FY20 pilot for our Cardiac 
and Vascular teams to trial 
lifecycle analysis software. 
The scorecard and pilot will 
help our development teams CASE STUDY
REDUCING  
PLASTIC WASTE  
IN HEAL THCARE
Each day, U.S. healthcare 
facilities generate 
approximately 12,700 
metric tons of waste, with 
as much as 25% comprised 
of plastic packaging and 
products. As members of 
the Healthcare Plastics 
Recycling Council, we 
are working toward an 
economically viable 
solution where plastic is 
diverted from landfill and 
given a second life.
Medtronic follows international 
guidelines and regulations for 
the disposal of electronic waste. 
Where possible, we reduce 
landfill waste by recycling 
products at their end of useful 
life. In FY19, our Memphis 
distribution center increased its 
diversion rate. Each year , the site 
is responsible for processing 
approximately 11 MT of products that are no longer 
usable. Working with a zero-
waste electronics recycling 
partner in FY19, the site now 
recycles 100% of these 
products. 
In FY19, we continued to recycle, 
reuse, and remanufacture 
medical sensors from our 
Nellcor™ business, which 
specializes in pulse oximetry 
devices. Through this program, 
we diverted 190 MT of devices 
from landfill. 
For more information on 
product recycling, see our 
product packaging and 
disposition page. SUPPORTING A

At Medtronic, our history of 
inclusion and diversity began 
with our Mission, written by co-
founder Earl Bakken in 1960, well 
before diversity and inclusion 
efforts were proven to be key 
drivers of business innovation. 
T oday, it continues to guide our 
global culture, directing us to 
serve all people in need of our 
therapies — to alleviate pain, 
restore health, and extend life. 
The fifth tenet of our Mission, to recognize the personal worth  
of all employees, underlies  
our approach to inclusion  
and diversity.
We are a stronger , better 
company when we foster an 
inclusive workplace and bring 
diversity of thought to our work 
by employing a workforce that 
represents our patients and 
customers. INCLUSION AND  
DIVERSITY HIGHLIGHTS
In FY19, we made significant progress toward our 2020 
diversity goals, surpassing our 20% or more target for 
ethnically diverse leadership in the U.S. and on track to meet 
our 40% or more target for women leadership globally, 
putting us closer to our ultimate aspiration of 50% or more. 
From a pay perspective, we 
believe all people should 
be paid equally for the 
same work. In FY19, we 
achieved 99% gender pay

In FY19, ethnically diverse talent represented 36% of our U.S. 
workforce. T wenty-two percent of U.S. management positions are 
held by ethnically diverse talent, exceeding our 2020 target of at 
least 20%. We are committed to continual improvement and strive to 
maintain or exceed this level of representation in FY20.
In FY18, we developed a diversity scorecard that managers use to 
identify gaps in hiring and representation. Based on scorecard results, 
in FY19 we developed shared objectives and streamlined processes 
across departments to increase collaboration and remove barriers 
that affect all candidates — including ethnically diverse talent.
There is a growing awareness of the impacts of unconscious bias — 
accidental, unintended, subtle, and completely unconscious choices, 
made by everyone, all the time. T o counter this, expert-facilitated 
training provides tools to adjust automatic patterns of thinking to 
mitigate this bias. In FY19, Medtronic employees at the VP level

CASE STUDY
MEETING THE NEEDS 
OF HEAL THCARE 
WITH FEMALE 
SURGEONS 
By 2020, the United 
States will need at least 
100,000 additional 
surgeons to meet 
healthcare demands. This 
challenge is compounded 
by the fact that only 
13% of surgeons are 
women, despite women 
representing nearly half 
of all medical school 
applicants. For over 
10 years, Medtronic 
has partnered with the 
Association of Women 
Surgeons to advance 
the careers of female 
surgeons. We support 
women in surgery by 
providing advanced 
education, access to 
innovative products, and 
professional development 
opportunities. T o date, we 
have sponsored over 100 
career conferences for 
female surgeons.66In FY19, Medtronic joined the Human Rights 
Campaign Business Coalition for the  
Equality Act.Preventing discrimination
We take a multifaceted 
approach to ensuring that 
our work environment is free 
from discrimination based on 
race, ethnicity, gender , gender 
identity, sexual orientation, 
disability, religion, and other 
identities. Nondiscrimination is 
addressed in our companywide 
policies, including our Code of 
Conduct and our Global  
Human Rights and Labor 
Standards Policy, which also 
addresses workforce equality 
and fair employment. For more 
on how our Global Human Rights 
Program prevents discrimination 
against vulnerable groups, see 
the Medtronic Global Human  
Rights Report.
We encourage our employees 
to report any issues of 
discrimination through their manager , Human Resources, 
Legal, or Compliance 
representatives, or the Voice 
Y our Concern Line. We 
follow employment law by 
ensuring that an objective 
party investigates all claims of 
discrimination. We have a zero-
tolerance policy and respond 
to all confirmed claims with 
disciplinary action — up  
to termination. 
Outside of our company, we 
provide public support for 
human rights equality. In FY19, 
Medtronic supported the 
Equality Act, U.S. legislation to 
expand the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 to protect LGBTQ+ people 
against discrimination. We 
also joined the Human Rights 
Campaign Business Coalition for 
the Equality Act along with more 
than 235 other companies.67 Asia Society — 2019 (Best

success improve our business performance. By providing career 
development resources, we increase engagement and strengthen  
our talent pipeline.
Investing in the professional development of  
our workforce
Our learning and development programs help talent reach their career 
potential, build lifelong relationship skills, and take part in our inclusive 
culture. We support growth by providing educational opportunities  
at all levels of the organization and by promoting internally. In FY19, 
we filled 32% of open roles at the company with internal candidates. 
At the VP level, we have moved from filling 50% to 80% of those roles 
with internal candidates. Investing in learning and development contributes to employee 
satisfaction and retention. Across our programs we’ve seen increased 
engagement and retention scores from participants compared  
to their peers. In FY19, we spent $77.5 million on learning and 
development resources. 
We take a structured approach to career conversations. As of FY19, 
95% of our workforce has a development plan logged in our talent 
management system. Medtronic managers meet with employees at 
least three times each year to discuss career aspirations, set goals, 
and review performance. This formal process reaches 100% of the 
Medtronic workforce. We encourage all managers to hold ongoing 
one-on-one meetings to touch base with employees throughout 
the year . In FY20, we launched a pilot program to create a consistent 
performance management and career development framework for 
9,000 employees at our 13 manufacturing facilities. Based on the 
results of the pilot, we will refine the framework to best meet  
employee needs.  
In FY19, we offered more than 36,600 virtual and in-person learning 
resources for employees. These include our Experience Café platform, 
which helps individuals expand their professional networks through 
structured, experiential learning opportunities. DEVELOPMENT

identified through the  
survey were:
 84% of employees said  
that being proactive within 
their team is supported  
and encouraged
 81% of employees felt like 
they belong at Medtronic
FY19 survey results also showed 
that Medtronic employees are 
increasingly likely to recommend 
us as an employer and to see us 
as an innovative and inclusive 
organization. Compared to 
FY18, employees reported 
improvements in being able 
to get work done, despite the 
complexity and size of our 
organization. However , we 
recognize that this area remains 
one of our biggest opportunities 
for improvement. In FY20, we are launching a 
new development program for 
aspiring leaders and updating 
our programs to be more 
inclusive of learning preferences. 
Employee engagement
We encourage employees 
to voice their opinions at 
Medtronic, and we invite their 
feedback through our annual 
Organizational Health Survey. 
In FY19, we increased our 
participation rate to 78%, with 
more than 69,000 employees 
responding. Our male and 
female engagement rates were 
75% and 77%, respectively,  
for an overall engagement 
rate of 76% — 11% above the

reduce the costs associated 
with VP onboarding. Through leadership 
development programs, we 
strengthen the capabilities 
of our people managers — 
benefiting employees at all 
levels of the organization. Our 
programs in FY19 included:
 EDGE — imparts leadership 
skills to all Medtronic leaders, 
including ways to mitigate 
unconscious bias.
 Empower — teaches 
operations supervisors 
leadership tools to 
strengthen their teams and 
achieve business results. 
 Ignite — accelerates 
readiness of high-potential 
directors for higher-level 
leadership roles.70We integrate safety into our workplace culture to protect employees from 
hazards. Recognizing the role that employers play in physical, mental, and 
financial well-being, we provide resources to help our people thrive.
A culture of safety
We maintain a robust environmental, health, and safety (EHS) 
management system through the following methods:
 Setting annual internal EHS goals
 Proactively identifying and managing risks
 Implementing training programs
 Monitoring regulatory trends
 Auditing sites for compliance and completing corrective actionsOur focus is on continuous improvement and in FY19, our newly 
integrated EHS information system allowed us to collect more 
comprehensive safety data. We encourage employees to report 
hazards and near misses as part of our safety culture. In FY19, 
employees reported more than 3,900 hazard observations and 
logged 715 near-miss reports, which are used to improve workplace 
safety. FY19 data also show increases in our Injury Incident rate and 
our Lost/Restricted Workday Case rate. We attribute the increase 
to improved reporting and increased engagement following 
employee communications. There were no work-related fatalities of 
Medtronic employees. 
In FY19, our Organizational Health Survey showed that 90% of 
respondents feel we actively encourage employees to work safely, 
and 91% of respondents are comfortable reporting safety concerns 
and injuries at work.  HEAL TH &

In FY19, we launched the Free Cash Flow Challenge — an employee 
engagement initiative designed to increase our free cash flow, a 
source of funding for innovation and breakthrough research.  
T o help all 90,000+ employees contribute to our financial health,  
we created informative animations, quizzes, and a library of on-

CARING FOR FAMILIES 
We aim to support our 
employees in all that they 
do, both personally and 
professionally. In FY19, we 
launched the Medtronic Family 
Care Leave benefit. It provides 
up to six additional weeks of 
paid time off for employees to 
care for sick family members or 
support family after a spouse, 
child, or parent is called to 
active military duty. The benefit 
also covers parents bonding 
with a new child including birth, 
adoptive or surrogate, and 
non-birth parents. 
Monica Casillas, a Medtronic 
Customer Service 
Representative, was on 
maternity leave when 
Medtronic called her about the 
new benefit.   
“When I went into labor , I was 
expecting to be back to work 
in six weeks,” explains Casillas. 
“Now Medtronic was offering six more weeks to give me 
extra time to bond with my 
baby. I felt like I was really  
cared about.”
For birth mothers, Family 
Care Leave is in addition to 
maternity benefits. When 
combined with accrued paid 
time off, and by participating 
in our Healthy Pregnancy 
program, a new mother may be 
on leave for up to 18 weeks and 
paid at 100% for the full leave.The board of directors’

RESPONSIBL Y
Our positive impacts on the 
world are amplified by being 
a responsible corporate 
citizen. As we continue to push 
the boundaries of medical 
technology to improve the 
health of millions of patients 
around the world, it is imperative 
that we maintain and expand 
our reputation for excellence. 
We are committed to strong 
corporate governance, 
impeccable ethics, high-quality 
products, and a responsible and 
diverse supply chain.76Strong corporate governance, 
including clear policies and 
procedures, protects our future. 
Governance is fundamental 
to earning the trust of our 
stakeholders and staying 
focused on improving the lives 
of patients. 
The Medtronic board of 
directors and executive 
leadership are charged with 
company oversight, balancing 
stakeholder interests, and 
ensuring that business decisions 
align with our Mission. BOARD OF DIRECTORS: LEADING WITH CLARITY ,  
CONSISTENCY , AND DIVERSITY 
Medtronic is governed by an independent board with 11 members as of the end of FY19, including our CEO, 
Omar Ishrak, and lead independent director , Scott Donnelly. The board is engaged in our Citizenship efforts, 
which deliver value to our employees, customers, and investors. 
Our board has six standing committees led by independent directors, including:
 Audit n    Nominating and Corporate Governance 
 Compensation n    Quality
 Finance and Financial Risk n    T echnology and Value Creation
Our board has diverse experience, skills, and backgrounds that are essential to understanding and 
responding to the needs of our various stakeholders. When a change in board membership occurs, we view 
it as an opportunity to broaden representation, and diversity is a factor in our director-selection process. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance committee is responsible for reviewing candidates and 
assessing qualifications and character . Our full board of directors makes the final decision, selecting people 
who will steer the company with integrity and good judgment.

we hosted:
 A roundtable to share 
advanced policies and 
practices in value-based 
procurement with 67 
government representatives 
as well as academics from

Collaborating to  
improve healthcare 
A network of interdependent 
stakeholders is working to 
improve healthcare and 
overcome industry challenges. 
That network includes patients, 
physicians, treatment facilities, 
health system administrators, 
regulators, nonprofits, Globally, there is growing 
interest in universal health 
coverage (UHC) — the idea that 
everyone should have access to 
the health services they need, 
without risk of financial ruin or 
impoverishment. According to 
the World Health Organization, 
countries with UHC have 
improved health indicators, less 
poverty, and stronger economic 
development.13 
The Medtronic Mission 
and business strategy are 
aligned with UN Sustainable 
Development Goal 3, “Good 
Health and Well-Being,” which 
calls on governments to 
implement UHC. Through our 
focus on access, efficiency, 
and innovation, we are well 
positioned to support leaders 
with the transition. 
Medtronic is taking an active role 
in the global UHC conversation. 
In early FY20, we participated in 
the UN High-Level Meeting on 
Universal Health Coverage, and 
our CEO chaired a panel on  
the topic.PUBLIC POLICY 
Medtronic is transforming 
healthcare by expanding access, 
improving quality and outcomes, 
and increasing efficiency. Public 
policy engagement is one of 
the tools we use to enable 
this change. Our Government 
Affairs, Health Economics and 
Reimbursement, and Regulatory 
Affairs teams work with 
governments, peers, and other 
stakeholders to:
 Enable technology 
innovations
 Facilitate access to lifesaving 
therapies and devices
 Generate economic value 
for healthcare system 
stakeholders 
 Promote outcome-driven  
and value-based healthcare
 Harmonize and coordinate

We are not alone in the pursuit 
of a more sustainable and 
accessible healthcare system. 13  https:/ /www.who.int/health_financing/
UHC_ENvs_BD.PDF, page 1078In addition to annual training, employees are required to integrate 
ethics into their performance goals. During annual reviews, managers 
assess ethical behavior and their employees’ personal goals.
Efforts to ensure that employees understand and are accountable 
for the Code are ongoing. In FY18, we updated our Global Business 
Conduct Standards to expand guidance on how to ethically interact 
with healthcare professionals and organizations. In FY19, we developed 
a set of situation-based training modules for targeted areas. For 
instance, we created customized conflicts of interest training for 
procurement employees and about 2,000 select Medtronic leaders.

Guiding policies and principles, including our Code of Conduct, are 
used to communicate company expectations. The Code is accessible, 
explicit, and relevant to day-to-day work. We have a comprehensive 
program for ensuring that every employee understands and is 
accountable for our Code: 
 We translate the Code into 22 languages so 99% of employees can 
read it in their first language.
 We deliver multilingual Code training for new employees and those

misconduct, compared to  
1,183 in FY17. About 35%  
of FY19 allegations were  
related to workplace conduct. 81Enduring customer relationships are built on trust, aligned values,  
and shared goals. Sales and marketing employees are ambassadors 
for our company, and we teach them to put integrity at the core of 
their practice.RESPONSIBLE MARKETING TO 
CUSTOMERS AND PA TIENTS 
We promote our products based on their approved use, and 
employees must adhere to the policies made explicit in our Code  
of Conduct and AdvaMed’s voluntary Code of Ethics on 
Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Our requirements 
for product marketing are also included in our Global Business 
Conduct Standards Policy and our Physician Collaboration 
Policy. We educate employees on these requirements through 
ongoing communications and trainings. 
In FY19, we introduced five new product-promotion trainings 
tailored to marketing and sales employees. Through this expanded 
training, we reached more than 21,000 marketing and sales 
employees, 97% of employees in those roles.
Our internal investigations program helps ensure that our 
marketing practices comply with Medtronic policies and external 
regulations. T o make this program more effective, in FY19 we 
consolidated it into one center of excellence and standardized 
the investigation processes. Throughout the year , we reviewed 
43,000 transactions for sales and marketing risks, including for ETHICS IN 
SALES &
MARKETING
Adding  
Business Value
 
Our reputation for the highest standards of ethics in our 
behavior is essential in all our business dealings, and especially 
so in sales and marketing. T o create a consistent culture of 
integrity across Medtronic, we train all employees on our  
Code of Conduct and provide job-specific training to those in 
high-risk roles.82ETHICAL INTERACTION WITH 
HEAL THCARE PROFESSIONALS
We work alongside physicians and healthcare systems to expand 
our positive impact on patients, while adhering to our Physician 
Collaboration Policy, which establishes standards for our interactions 
with healthcare professionals. Our collaborations include:
 Inventing new devices and therapies
 Developing educational materials and campaigns
 Conducting clinical research
 Providing training on how to implement our devices and therapies
We disclose payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals 
in every country where it is required by law. In the United States, 
payment disclosures are published on the U.S. Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services Open Payments site. As discussed above, in 
FY19 we resolved three cases related to alleged improper sales and 
marketing practices or interactions with healthcare providers. 
Countering corruption
The Medtronic board of directors oversees our anti-bribery and  
anti-corruption program. The program is strengthened by feedback 
from regulators, third-party auditing, and benchmarks of other 
companies. We have 217 (full-time equivalent) employees with 
expertise in anti-corruption enforcement, including former U.S. 
Department of Justice prosecutors. potential off-label use promotion. In our internal review, we found four 
incidents of noncompliance with our policies concerning marketing 
communications and no incidents concerning our policies for  
product and service information and labeling. 
In FY19, we settled three matters related to alleged improper 
marketing or sales practices by entities acquired by Medtronic  
(legacy ev3/Covidien) totaling $50.9 million. The settlements that the 
Medtronic entities agreed to all concerned matters that took place 
either largely or entirely prior to Medtronic acquiring the businesses 
in which the activities took place. Medtronic has made significant 
investments in ensuring that it fulfills its obligations to all of its 
stakeholders and to do business the right way.

accountable to our anti-corruption requirements. The DROs meet 
with distributors to discuss and certify understanding of ethical 
requirements. Distributors must assign a lead team member to 
manage ethical responsibilities within their organization and set a 
performance goal related to the initiative. In FY19, we expanded our 
onsite monitoring program to reach more than 11% of our third-party 
distributors, compared to 2.5% the previous year .
We are expanding our direct sales infrastructure in specific markets 
to reduce our reliance on third-party distributors, decrease risk, and 
improve customer service.
In FY19, Medtronic was not subject to any fines, settlements, or 
monetary losses related to noncompliance with anti-corruption laws.

We established a commercial 
Distributor Relationship Corruption is a risk in our 
industry. Our Code of Conduct 
prohibits personnel from 
exchanging gifts, bribes, or

our policies, guidelines, and 
training programs, we clearly 
communicate our ethical 
standards to Medtronic 
employees. An employee can 
raise an ethical concern through 
our Voice Y our Concern Line, 
among other channels. 
We implement anti-corruption 
training to make internal and 
external stakeholders aware of 
regulations and to explain how 
ethically challenging scenarios 
should be addressed. Anti-
corruption is covered in our 
required Code of Conduct 
training cycle. Our process 
ensures that new hires receive 
anti-corruption training upon 
joining the company and that 
customer-facing employees 
receive the training every  
two years. 84Protecting information is critically important for Medtronic, our 
customers, and most importantly, the patients who use our products. 
We have designed our security and privacy programs to safeguard 
data in a rapidly evolving environment.
We are in a time of rapid adoption of connected data devices and 
powerful data analysis. Big data is contributing to innovative products 
and faster research, and it is critical to our business to protect  
this information. 
Our cybersecurity program is constantly adapting and improving in 
response to technology developments and the threat landscape. Our 
program is designed to reflect ISO 27001 and the National Institute 
of Standards and T echnology standards. T o advance data security 
practices, we collaborate with third-party organizations such as the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center and AdvaMed. 
We also contribute to global product and cybersecurity standards in 
collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
other regulatory advocacy groups. 
Medtronic employees and contractors play a crucial role in 
safeguarding data. We train all employees and contingent workers 
on data privacy and security, so they understand their role in 
identifying, protecting, and preserving particular types of data. In 
FY19, we expanded our trainings to raise employee awareness of 
privacy and security obligations. We provided E.U. General Data 
Protection Regulation training for global corporate employees and 
noncorporate E.U. employees. We also delivered Privacy by Design 
training to the vast majority of E.U. employees and employees in key 
global functions, such as Legal and IT . U.S. employees additionally 
completed training on U.S. privacy laws. 
When we acquire a company, we conduct privacy and security  
due diligence, implement policies and procedures, and deliver 
employee training.
Vendors must also adhere to our data security and privacy 
standards, and we review privacy and security risks as part of our 
vendor assessment process. Contingent workers must complete 
annual privacy and security training. D ATA

disruptions and quality failures.87internal website, Inside Medtronic, features diverse suppliers  
that bring exceptional value and positive impact to Medtronic  
and our customers.
 Extending the value of diversity through our supply chain  
We are working with our larger suppliers to support and enable 
them to engage with diverse companies in their own supply 
chains. Building on an earlier pilot program, in FY19 we worked 
with selected suppliers to review their engagement with diverse 
suppliers, including their level of spend. We have extended this 
program to include our top 50 suppliers.
 Recognizing diversity at the heart of our world-class  
supply chain  
At our annual Global Supplier Conference, our Supplier Excellence 
Awards recognize a select group of suppliers for their role in 
bringing exceptional value to the Medtronic supply chain. In FY19, 
nearly half of these awards went to diverse or small companies, 
demonstrating the importance of these suppliers to our business.

We co-hosted the fair with Disability:IN, National Association 
of Women Business Owners, the National Veteran Business 
Development Center , the North Central Minority Supplier 
Development Council, Quorum, and the Women’s Business 
Development Center . More than 250 attendees met for a day of 
networking and supplier development programming.SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
A key strength of our supply chain is its diversity. Working with 
businesses owned by women, ethnically diverse groups, disabled 
people, LGBTQ+ individuals, and veterans keeps us agile and 
innovative. We proactively seek to maintain this diversity through 
our Supplier Diversity program. Our Supplier Diversity team, Supplier 
Diversity Steering Committee, and executive management team 
oversee this program, setting strategy and goals each year .
Our Supplier Diversity Policy recognizes and supports 
10 diverse supplier types, including:

IN OUR SUPPL Y CHAIN 
Through our Responsible Supply Management Program, we work with our suppliers to:
 Uphold human rights and labor standards in our supply chain
 Reduce our environmental impact globally and locally
 Enhance our reputation 
Medtronic codes, policies, and standards relevant to our supply chain
 Global Supplier Standards describe the minimum social, ethical, and environmental requirements 
and expectations of our suppliers. Supplier selection and management processes, supplier 
agreements, and purchase order terms and conditions all include reference to the Standards.
 Global Human Rights and Labor Standards Policy applies to all Medtronic locations, all Medtronic 
personnel, and any third-party labor agencies providing employees on our behalf. We strive to:
 Ensure that our suppliers adhere to the minimum standards that are outlined within this policy 
 Conduct our business in a manner that demonstrates a respect for internationally recognized 
human rights and the dignity of all people
 Global Anti-Human T rafficking and Forced Labor Policy outlines our commitment to a work 
environment free from human trafficking, slavery, unlawful child labor , and forced labor of any kind. 
The policy applies to all Medtronic locations and personnel and any third-party labor agencies 
providing services to Medtronic. We strive to ensure that our suppliers adhere to the minimum 
standards that are outlined within this policy.
 Code of Conduct includes employees, officers, directors, and anyone conducting business on

potential environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) risks. 
This included certain suppliers 
located in high-risk countries for 
human rights and environmental 
compliance, or where vulnerable 
workers are likely to be 
employed. We are taking the 
learnings from these initial 150 
self-assessments to build the 
capacity of our suppliers for 
future assessments and guide 
our audit process. 
As we continue to extend 
our monitoring and auditing 
process, we know there is more 
work to do to monitor and 
mitigate less visible risks. We 
are determined to work with our 
suppliers to fully understand 
and improve their social and 
environmental performance — 
ultimately contributing to a more 
sustainable supply chain. During this first year , we 
focused on building the 
capacity of our suppliers 
to answer our requests for 
information comprehensively 
and consistently. 
 In year two, we will focus on 
self-assessment activities 
with top-spend direct 
material suppliers and 
contract manufacturers. We 
will conduct onsite audits with 
those suppliers considered 
to be at the highest risk of 
noncompliance.
 In year three, we plan to 
extend the coverage of the 
program to more suppliers.
We launched our new 
monitoring process by

process to address 
noncompliance:
 We issue compliance 
improvement requests to 
ensure that corrective action  
is taken.
 We ask category managers to 
incorporate these requests 
into suppliers’ continuous

 If issues persist, ultimately 
a review of the business 
relationship will occur . 
In FY19, we trained 55 category

SUPPLIER QUALITY 
MANAGEMENT
Our ability to improve lives 
depends upon the quality of 
our products. We share this 
responsibility for quality with 
our suppliers, communicating 
our expectations through our 
Supplier Quality Excellence 
Manual.
We support suppliers to meet 
our standards through:
 Regular quality audits based 
on product and supplier risk
 Continuous improvement 
programs, facilitated onsite 
at supplier manufacturing 
locations
 Collaboration with suppliers to 
improve the design, reliability, 
and manufacturability of 
components and products
 Support of supplier business 
continuity management 
planning initiatives — building their capability to proactively 
identify and mitigate global 
operational risks 
In FY19, we updated our existing 
supplier quality protocols, tools, 
and training materials to make 
them easier to use and more 
accessible. We also included 
new guidance on regulatory 
requirements, such as the 
recent E.U. Medical Device 
Regulation.
Currently, four Medtronic 
supplier sites participate 
in the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Case for 
Quality program. Additionally, 
Medtronic subscribes to 
MedAccred — an industry-
managed supply chain 
oversight program. This 
third-party accreditation 
focuses on improving process 
repeatability while reducing 
nonconformances. We have 
shared details of the program 
with suppliers and encourage 
them to pursue accreditation. 93As we continue to deliver innovative new treatments and therapies, 
our commitment to quality must remain constant. Our customers, 
patients, partners, and investors trust us to deliver products that are 
safe, effective, and reliable. Our global quality strategy guides us to 
take a rigorous approach to safety and reliability at each stage of the 
product life cycle.ENSURING QUALITY ACROSS  
OUR VALUE CHAIN
We monitor quality at each stage in our value chain — design, 
manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical trials, and post-market 
surveillance. Through our “Quality Begins with Me” culture, all 
Medtronic employees share this responsibility. 
We share four fundamental expectations through ongoing 
communications and training, so that every Medtronic employee 
knows quality is nonnegotiable:
 Put the patient first
 Be courageous
 Strive to prevent issues before they arise
 Hold each other accountable
In FY19, we developed a “Quality Begins With Me 2.0” assessment 
model that we will pilot at three sites in FY20. Compared to the 
previous version, this model helps us delve deeper into the data 
to understand the underlying causes of scores and evaluate 
improvement year-over-year . It also adds the flexibility to tailor 
assessments to the specific needs and challenges of the site or 
functions being assessed. PRODUCT

(SOAR)Through the SOAR program, we partner with 
strategic suppliers to ensure that risks are identified 
and mitigated, and that products and processes are 
designed correctly. Read more about our approach to 
supplier quality management.New product development 
requires collaboration across 
several Medtronic functions, 
including Research and 
Development, Operations, 
Quality, and Marketing. T o 
embed DRM practices across 
the company, we:
 Conduct annual assessments 
of our product development 
locations and execute 
improvement plans based on 
the results
 Provide Green Belt, Black 
Belt, and Master Black Belt 
training and certification to 
increase the skills within the 
organization to make those 
improvements
 Provide customized training 
for project development 
teams to enhance their 
planning and execution of 
DRM activitiesPRODUCT  
DESIGN AND 
DEVELOPMENT
Design, reliability, 
manufacturability
The Medtronic Design, 
Reliability, Manufacturability 
(DRM) methodology is our set 
of best practices for ensuring 
product quality, safety, and 
reliability throughout product 
design and development. 
Our engineers use DRM to carry 
out predictive engineering: 
simulating product use, 
predicting and measuring 
performance, and identifying 
areas for improvement. This 
process yields higher-quality 
designs and reduces time to 
market — enabling patients 
in need to access products 
as safely and efficiently as 
possible. We continually improve 
our predictive capabilities by 
refining our design practices 
and measuring predictive 
engineering outcomes for every 
new product.96 Sharing learnings from external inspections with all sites across the 
enterprise to implement preventive process improvements
 Facilitating improvements at 51 of our facilities through compliance 
assessments and audits 
We value external review and assessment of our quality and 
compliance by regulatory agencies. These assessments confirm 
regulatory priorities and highlight areas where we can strengthen 
our approach. We implement changes to policies, procedures, and 
processes when needed, sharing our learnings across our facilities 
through our Inspection Knowledge Management process.
Our goal is to maintain an average of 0.5 or fewer findings per external 
regulatory inspection and 1.0 or fewer findings per U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) inspection. We met both goals this year , with an 
average of 0.17 findings per regulatory inspection and 0.23 findings 
per FDA inspection (a 44% improvement from FY18).

MCARE Assessments and 
Supported Improvements40 45 51When applied to high-risk processes, our FTQ methodology achieves  
a 30% to 80% reduction in nonconformances, including those related 
to product specifications. The methodology can help individual 
manufacturing sites achieve between $200,000 and $300,000 in  
cost savings.18  
In FY19, we extended deployment of FTQ to 100% of our 
manufacturing sites and launched our enterprise-wide scorecard  
to formally track program benefits. We also launched an FTQ  
center of excellence in Puerto Rico to support consistent utilization  
of the methodology by DRM practitioners. 
QUALITY AND COMPLIANCE  
A T OUR F ACILITIES
The Medtronic Corporatewide Assessment for Regulatory Excellence 
(MCARE) is our global compliance oversight program for assessing 
quality management systems at our facilities. Its focus is threefold: 
maintain a consistently high level of quality, comply with regulations, 
and prepare for new regulatory requirements. Through MCARE,  
we engage with site leadership at manufacturing, design, and 
distribution centers. 
In FY19, the Corporate Quality MCARE team continued its oversight 
of quality system compliance, including: 
 Participating in steering committees and oversight of warning  
letter resolution activities 
 Reviewing remediation actions to ensure robust work  
and documentation
18  Based on case studies where sites have executed FTQ methodology at a given work step or work 
steps. This figure increases when FTQ is used more often.97
Approval from the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use 
Committee is required before 
we carry out any such activities. 
We comply with all relevant 
standards and requirements  
for animal-related research  
and testing. This includes those 
set by the Association for 
Assessment and Accreditation 
of Laboratory Animal Care,  
the FDA, and the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture’s 
Animal Welfare Act.
We are committed to treating 
all animals used in the research 
process respectfully and 
humanely, by taking every 
feasible measure to safeguard 
their welfare. We work with 
scientists, veterinary surgeons, 
and other experts to refine trials 
to minimize distress or harm.
Seeking alternatives
The International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) is 
developing a standard on testing 
of human skin cell–based PRE-CLINICAL 
RESEARCH
Pre-clinical research gives 
us vital insight into how our 
products will function in practice. 
The pre-clinical stage can 
include animal-related research, 
as well as non-animal human 
cadaver and modeling work.
Animal-related research
Regulatory requirements for 
medical products sometimes 
necessitate animal research 
and testing. We use animals in 
research activities only when no 
acceptable alternatives exist,  
as described in our Policy 
Regarding the Use of Animals. 
This policy applies to:
 Research that contributes 
significantly to patient welfare 
 Work specifically mandated 
by regulatory agencies to 
ensure patient safety  
or efficacyirritation. T o inform this work, 
we submit research findings on 
alternatives to animal testing for 
skin irritation. We continue to 
invest in our corporate research 
group’s fundamental modeling 
work, with the goal of reducing 
the number of animals used in 
future research.
CLINICAL TRIALS
Clinical trials are a key 
component in establishing the 
effectiveness and safety of our 
products, and a critical part 
of quality control. More than 
2,000 clinical employees work 
to ensure that our clinical trials 
are undertaken ethically and 
effectively. 
We are committed to following 
our Code of Conduct and 
Global Business Conduct 
Standards Policy when 
conducting clinical trials, and 
to adhering to all relevant laws 
and regulations. This ensures 
that we take a consistent and rigorous approach to protecting 
patient safety and safeguarding 
patient data. It also helps to 
deliver accurate findings.
We revise our internal guidelines 
and procedures to meet new 
and emerging regulatory 
requirements, including recent 
updates to take account of:
 The General Data Protection 
Regulation, effective  
May 2018
 The E.U. Medical Device 
Regulation, effective  
May 2020
Medtronic is a member of 
the working group shaping 
the next revision of the ISO 
14155:2011 standard for clinical 
research. We are preparing for 
implementation of the revised 
standard in time for its expected 
launch in 2020.98PRODUCT USE AND 
PERFORMANCE
Post-market surveillance
Once a product is launched, we 
track its use and collect data 
on patient outcomes to obtain 
vital feedback for future product 
designs and to measure and 
improve patient safety. We:
 Collect data through our 
Post-Approval Clinical 
Surveillance process, in 
partnership with hospitals, 
health systems, physicians, 
clinics, governments, and 
third parties
 Fund in-depth, post-market 
clinical studies to further 
understand the efficacy 
of specific therapies and 
product lines
 Collect and analyze customer 
feedback and information 
through our global complaint 
handling systemCollaboration, engagement, and data sharing
Sharing knowledge and data about clinical trials contributes to safety, quality, and efficiency — accelerating 
medical discovery and enabling patients to benefit more quickly. 
The U.S. Clinical T rials Registry is a national database detailing the purpose, eligibility requirements, 
locations, and status of more than 310,000 clinical trials.19 Medtronic and other companies operating in the 
United States are required to disclose information to the database about applicable trials.
We also:
 Collaborate with external researchers, institutions, and physicians to advance our clinical trials practice

FINANCIAL MEASURES 103Pump therapy is not recommended for 
people whose vision or hearing does not allow 
recognition of pump signals and alarms. Pump 
therapy is not recommended for people who 
are unwilling or unable to maintain contact 
with their healthcare professional. The safety 
of the MiniMed™ 670G system has not been 
studied in pregnant women. For complete 
details of the system, including product 
and important safety information such as 
indications, contraindications, warnings 
and precautions associated with system 
and its components, please consult http:/ /

safety-information#minimed-670g and 
the appropriate user guide at http:/ /www.
medtronicdiabetes.com/download-library.IMPORT ANT SAFETY INFORMA TION: 
MINIMED™ 670G SYSTEM 
The Medtronic MiniMed™ 670G system is 
intended for continuous delivery of basal insulin 
(at user selectable rates) and administration of 
insulin boluses (in user selectable amounts) for 
the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus 
in persons, seven years of age and older , 
requiring insulin as well as for the continuous 
monitoring and trending of glucose levels in 
the fluid under the skin. The MiniMed™ 670G 
system includes SmartGuard™ technology, 
which can be programmed to automatically 
adjust delivery of basal insulin based on 
Continuous Glucose Monitor sensor glucose 
values and can suspend delivery of insulin 
when the sensor glucose value falls below or 
is predicted to fall below predefined threshold 
values. The system requires a prescription. 
The Guardian™ Sensor (3) glucose values are 
not intended to be used directly for making 
therapy adjustments, but rather to provide 
an indication of when a fingerstick may be required. A confirmatory finger stick test via 
the CONTOUR®NEXT LINK 2.4 blood glucose 
meter is required prior to making adjustments 
to diabetes therapy. All therapy adjustments 
should be based on measurements obtained 
using the CONTOUR®NEXT LINK 2.4 blood 
glucose meter and not on values provided 
by the Guardian™ Sensor (3). Always check 
the pump display to ensure the glucose 
result shown agrees with the glucose results 
shown on the CONTOUR®NEXT LINK 2.4 
blood glucose meter . Do not calibrate your 
CGM device or calculate a bolus using a blood 
glucose meter result taken from an Alternative 
Site (palm) or from a control solution test. It 
is not recommended to calibrate your CGM 
device when sensor or blood glucose values 
are changing rapidly, e.g., following a meal or 
physical exercise. If a control solution test is 
out of range, please note that the result may be 
transmitted to your pump when in the “ Always” 
send mode.WARNING: Medtronic performed an 
evaluation of the MiniMed™ 670G system and 
determined that it may not be safe for use 
in children under the age of 7 because of the 
way that the system is designed and the daily 
insulin requirements. Therefore this device 
should not be used in anyone under the age 
of 7 years old. This device should also not be 
used in patients who require less than a total 
daily insulin dose of 8 units per day because 
the device requires a minimum of 8 units per 
day to operate safely.
