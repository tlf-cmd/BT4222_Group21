12Foreword on Impact
Current ESG evaluation 
methodologies are 
fundamentally flawed. To 
achieve acutely -needed 
change, ESG needs to evolve to measure real -
world 
Impact .What ESG measures today: Investment Risk
Current environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
reporting does not measure the scope of positive impact on the world. Instead, it focuses on measuring the dollar 
value of risk / return.
Individual investors – who entrust their money to ESG 
funds of large investment institutions –are perhaps 
unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of 
companies that make climate change worse, not better.
An obvious example of this is measuring the impact of the 
automotive industry. One might think that the more electric 
vehicles an automaker sells, as a percentage of total 
volumes, the better its ESG score. However, this is not the 
case. As long as a company continues to slightly decrease 
emissions of its manufacturing operations while churning 
out gas -guzzlers, its ESG ratings are likely to go up.
Vehicle use -phase emissions, which represent 80 -90% of 
total automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of 
unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all.
It’s easy to see why some oil & gas companies rank higher 
than T esla on “Environmental Impact. ”
“The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is 
how rarely a company’s record on climate change seems to 
get in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder —or even to 
factor at all.”
ESG Mirage : Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat ESG needs to become: Company Impact
We need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes 
actual positive impact on our planet, so unsuspecting individual investors can choose to support companies that 
can make and prioritize positive change.
On the product front, companies should be required to use 
real-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it 
clear when estimates are provided instead of real -world 
figures. An example of this is vehicle “use -phase” 
emissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle 
emissions. Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically 
and almost never reflect real -world data. Automakers often 
have access to this data, but they don’t disclose it.
When it comes to a company’s employees, it is essential 
that they’re treated well, with a system in place to prevent discrimination of any kind, that they have a safe 
workplace andthat they are rewarded appropriately, with 
significant upside if their employer does well.
Many ESG ratings evaluate: “Does this ESG issue impact the 
profitability of the company?” We need a system that 
evaluates: “Does the growth of this company have a 
positive impact on the world?”
This evolution of ESG needs to be championed by 
institutional investors, rating agencies, public companies 
and the general public. As the world needs to strive for a substantial positive impact, we won’t be referring to ESG in 
this report. Instead, we’ll talk about Impact.3
In 2021, the global fleet of Tesla vehicles, energy storage and solar panels
enabled our customers to avoid emitting 8.4 million metric tons of CO2e
The 6.8 million metric tons of vehicle CO2e savings estimate is based on the net CO2e savings during the use -phase of a Tesla vehicle compared to an ICE vehicle with a real -world fuel economy of 
~24 mpg (of which 0.9 million metric tons was avoided through annual renewables matching for the global Supercharger network and home charging in California). The 1.6 million metric tons of 
solar + storage CO2e savings estimate is based on CO2e avoided through generation of zero -emission electricity from Tesla solar panels, including energy stored and later dispatched from our 
energy storage products. Geographic distribution of our deliveries (both vehicle and solar), grid mix at the country, state and province level and upstream emissions are reflected in these figures.4

Our Goals Tesla’s purpose is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
We strive to be the best on every metric relevant to our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to 
sustainable energy. T o maximize our impact, we plan to continue increasing our production volumes and the accessibility of our products. In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million 
electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year 
(compared to 4 GWh in 2021).
If we were to achieve such a vehicle delivery milestone through a consistent growth rate, the total T esla vehicle 
fleet would surpass tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, and each of those vehicles could save tons of CO
2e 
emissions every year of usage.
Furthermore, each product we make must be continuously improved at each step of its lifecycle: from 
manufacturing to consumer use to recycling.
We must also improve every metric, including the energy and water used to make our products, how safe our 
customers and employees are and the affordability and accessibility of our products. Each of these themes will 
be covered in this year’s Impact Report.8Making an Impact
Mission and the Tesla EcosystemSustainability drives us. And not just our products —it drives our values and mission as a company. It's at the 
core of everything we do and is what motivates us in our work. It also matters greatly to our customers, 
employees and shareholders. Our products and services are focused on transportation, energy production and 
storage —each of which have traditionally been some of the biggest polluters both in the U.S. and globally.
To achieve a zero- emissions future, we continue to implement programs and initiatives at our global 
manufacturing facilities and in our local communities.

Making an Impact
Mission and the Tesla EcosystemAddressing climate change through an entire ecosystem
Climate change is reaching alarming levels globally due in large part to emissions from burning fossil fuels for 
transportation and electricity generation. The world cannot reduce GHG emissions without addressing both 
energy generation and consumption. And the world cannot address its energy habits without first directly 
reducing emissions in the transportation and energy sectors.
We are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem . We both develop the 
technology behind this ecosystem and focus on the affordability of the products that comprise it. We seek to 
achieve this through our R&D and software development efforts as well as through our continuous drive to develop advanced manufacturing capabilities. 10
Corporate 
Governance11Corporate Governance
IntroductionManagement involvement
At Tesla, sustainability is everyone's job regardless of their position, geographic location or title. Our 
Sustainability Council, made up of leaders from across Tesla, collects data and prepares the analysis and 
content of this report. The Sustainability Council also presents this information to Tesla’s Board of Directors for 
review.
Board of Directors oversight
The Board of Directors serves as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and oversees the management of Tesla’s 
business —including reviewing the effectiveness of Tesla’s Impact priorities, initiatives and programs and this 
report. With those responsibilities in mind, the Board sets high standards for Tesla and its employees, officers and directors; and we periodically add new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board, such as Larry 
Ellison and Kathleen Wilson -Thompson in 2018 and Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020. Implicit in this approach is the 
importance of sound corporate governance.
12
Corporate Governance 
IntroductionSound corporate governance is critical to our mission. We are committed to establishing an operating 
framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and 
manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.
Tesla aspires to be a “do the right thing” company. Our Code of Business Ethics sets out basic principles that 
should help anyone working at or for Tesla avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. Tesla’s Code of 
Business Ethics and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Tesla’s website .
In addition, we believe in regular and transparent communication with employees. We encourage T esla employees to share their feedback openly (and anonymously, if they prefer), and provide easy methods to do 
so. We also regularly conduct employee surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement. We 
have a robust action planning process to ensure we proactively address the concerns or feedback.
We also have a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report concerns at any time. T esla keeps 
information reported by employees in confidence, whether through the hotline or another channel. Our policies 
prohibit retaliatory actions against employees for raising concerns or making complaints. We are committed to 
maintaining an open and transparent culture where it is safe and acceptable for all employees to raise concerns 
about policy violations by their manager or colleagues or about the workplace overall.13
Corporate Governance
Our ApproachOur unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance. And our mission requires a long -term 
focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders. Our corporate 
governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter -intuitive to some, 
but which have set up the T esla to achieve long -term success. Some examples include our decisions to:
•Manufacture all -electric vehicles (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV 
components
•Establish an international network of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite 
regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so
•Build Gigafactory 1, the largest lithium -ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively
•Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their 
own utility
•Deploy FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop complete Full Self -Driving capability in the 
future
•Compensate our CEO only if other shareholders realize tremendous value
These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately, decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies and are a significant reason why the annualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%. At the same time, the 
Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs 
stakeholder feedback including proposals we have historically received at our annual meetings. For example, at 
our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board proposed and recommended that stockholders adopt an 
amendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the term of our directors to two years. However, our 
stockholders did not approve that proposal.
The Board is directly and regularly engaged with senior management and the Sustainability Council and 
participates in robust shareholder outreach and feedback. In addition, our directors have significant experience as either top -level executives at public companies, as successful investors or as entrepreneurs who founded 
successful organizations.14Committees of the Board
The Board has four standing committees —the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee —which are each 
further described in the following pages. Each member of these committees qualifies as an independent 
director under the listing standards of NASDAQ. In addition, as part of our governance review and succession 
planning, the Board (led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) evaluates our leadership structure to ensure that it remains the optimal structure for Tesla, reviews the composition, size and 
performance of the Board and its committees, evaluates individual directors and identifies and evaluates 
candidates for election or re -election to the Board. Committee charters were updated in 2021 to reflect the 
growing risks and opportunities around ESG.
Board role in risk oversight
The Board is responsible for overseeing the major risks facing Tesla, while management is responsible for 
assessing and mitigating Tesla’s risks on a day -to-day basis. In addition, the Board has delegated oversight of 
certain categories of risk to its independent committees, which then report to the Board, as appropriate, on 
matters that involve the specific areas of risk that each committee oversees.Corporate Governance

Kathleen Wilson -
ThompsonIndependent director2018 X X X16Our compensation philosophy reflects our long -term mission and our startup origins. We emphasize structuring 
compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily 
in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear 
and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of 
stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive 
officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long -term interests of our stockholders.
T esla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any 
perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No 
named executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Musk’s performance -based 2018 CEO Performance Award.  A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of 
the 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would be measured based on Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational 
milestones of the Award. Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected 
the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on 
such base salary. However, he has never accepted hissalary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we 
eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s 
compensation is at -risk.
Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non -employee directors is designed to be consistent with our 
compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity -based compensation over cash in 
order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the 
long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted 
stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity -based 
compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value 
and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through 
the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are 
sold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that 
are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each 
director. Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic 
grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board determines otherwise. Corporate Governance
Compensation Philosophy
17Tesla builds products with privacy and security at their core
We believe that responsible data management and transparency is a prerequisite for continuous innovation. We 
live up to this commitment by providing information and controls in our products that let you choose how your 
personal data is collected and used.
Managing data privacy is a shared task through all levels of our organization
Data privacy is a shared responsibility in which every employee and our Board is expected to participate. Tesla 
has a large and diverse team of privacy and security professionals from all over the world and across legal, engineering and product organizations, who are dedicated to protecting customer data. Additionally, the Audit 
Committee of the Tesla Board of Directors is regularly briefed on incidents, emerging trends, controls and 
corrective actions taken by Tesla to ensure we are living up to our obligations and Privacy Principles.
Tesla’s Privacy Principles
Tesla is guided not only legally by its obligations under global privacy laws and regulations, but also by 
customer expectations and our Privacy Principles.
We do the right thing with data. We maintain trust by handling data as customers expect, keeping it accurate 
and complete and properly destroying it when it is no longer needed.
•We build privacy into our products from start to finish. Ensuring privacy is an important component when building world -class products and services, from inception to rollout and beyond.
•We give customers choices about their data. We put individuals in control by giving them clear and 
transparent ways to access, review, manage and delete their data with ease.
•We maintain trust through transparency. We are clear about the personal data we collect and how we're 
using or sharing it –ensuring that choosing a connected vehicle does not come at the sacrifice of customer 
privacy.
•We safeguard personal data. We implement rigorous controls and standards designed to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of Tesla’s data environment.Corporate Governance
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity
18
Privacy from day one
Tesla’s Privacy Principles and commitments are illustrated throughout all our products. For Tesla vehicles, 
customer personal data is protected from the moment they take delivery, ensuring that by default the vehicle 
data generated when driving is not associated with the customer's account or vehicle identification number. 
Tesla also puts customers in the driver’s seat when it comes to data sharing by providing a dedicated in -vehicle 
menu to adjust preferences at any time.
Additionally, from Powerwall to Solar Roof, energy products are designed to protect customer privacy. Tesla 
aims to collect a minimum amount of personal data necessary in providing the most engaging in -app energy 
experience. In furtherance of transparency, T esla has developed a seamless way for customers to download and 
access their energy data at any time right from the Tesla app.
Engaging the security community
We are also focused on ensuring that our vehicles are the most secure on the road. T o do that, our team of 
world -class engineers works day in and day out to ensure that our systems are always as secure as possible. 
And while some of the best security engineers work at Tesla, we believe that in order to design and build 
inherently secure systems, we cannot work alone. We work closely with the security research community to 
benefit from their collective expertise and diversity of thought.
Continuous product improvement
Tesla pioneered the concept of vehicles that improve and become more capable over time by ensuring that 
every Tesla vehicle made since 2012 can accept over -the-air (OTA) software updates. These updates have 
introduced new features and functionality that have made our vehicles smarter, safer and more enjoyable to 
drive. We have also used the OTA system to ensure that our vehicles are not only as secure as possible when 
they are delivered, but that they continue to stay as secure as possible throughout their lifetime.Corporate Governance
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity19Human rights are core to our mission of a sustainable future
The ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future. 
We believe all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to share our respect for human rights. 
Our human rights policy is the formalization of our commitment to uphold and respect these rights and the 
values they represent.
We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation's Universal Declaration for Human 
Rights (UDHR). The UDHR focuses on dignity, respect and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We 
are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain —including with respect to our 
employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. We require that our 
suppliers will also support and promote these values in their own operations and in those of their own suppliers.
Addressing human rights risks is an ongoing effort, involving engagement with our value chain for potential 
impacts, incorporating input from external stakeholders and reviewing and updating our own policies where 
necessary. With this understanding, Tesla is committed to addressing any potential human rights issues both 
within our own operations and those of our value chain.

20We have a zero -tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers
At T esla, we are committed to ensuring that the way we conduct our business and dealings with our suppliers 
reflects our values and our belief that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect. Tesla is committed 
to ensuring that our suppliers do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking. Modern slavery, 
child labor and human trafficking are crimes under the laws of countries throughout the world, but 
unfortunately continue to exist all over the globe. Our commitment on this front is summarized in our Supplier 
Code of Conduct as well as in our Human Rights Policy and Responsible Materials Policy , and we continue to 
work to ensure that our suppliers uphold the principles in these statements. We look to the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development ( OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use 
feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve it.
Through our commitment to enforce our Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Responsible Materials Policy, continuous training and the supplier audit and due diligence efforts, Tesla believes that there is 
low risk of, and have found no evidence to date of T esla causing, contributing to or being linked to modern 
slavery, child labor or human trafficking in our supply chain.

People and
Culture22What do we see as impact?
Our employees have gotten us to where we are today. T o continue innovating and changing the world for the 
better, we must ensure we have a talented and engaged workforce with ample opportunity to contribute to our mission and grow professionally.
Meaningful work: Working for Tesla is not just any job. The products we build are necessary for transitioning to 
a sustainable future.
Respectful, safe, inclusive and equitable workplace: Tesla is a majority -minority company. We strive to be a 
workplace where people love to come to work every day. While challenges will arise, Tesla has a zero -tolerance 
policy for harassment of any kind, and we will continue to address them head on as we keep growing.
We hire a lot: We created nearly 100,000 direct new jobs in a decade. While many manufacturers are trimming 
their operations, we are growing as quickly as is feasible.
Pay well: We want to make sure that we pay competitive wages, regardless of the region.
Significant upside potential: Every single employee of our company can receive their grants in stocks or 
options. If our company does well, every employee can benefit materially from Tesla’s success.
Outstanding benefits: We want our benefits to be an outlier in the manufacturing industry. Among other 
benefits, we provide medical, dental and vision plans with no paycheck deductions, 401k matching, life 
insurance, parental leave and family building benefits.
Build the future: Who wouldn’t want to work for a company with a mission of building a future we all want? 
Tesla’s mission is not only about making a product that people love, but also about making a real, sustained 
impact on transitioning the world to sustainable energy. In 2021, we received 3,000,000 job applications from those wanting to be a part of this mission.People and Culture

Our Plan #1: AttractingNearly 100,000 direct jobs in a decade —and we continue to hire extensively
Our employee count has grown ~70 fold over the past decade and, in just over ten years, T esla has created 
nearly 100,000 direct jobs. While many companies in the automotive industry have been trimming the number 
of employees and launching early retirement programs, we plan to grow our employee base for years to come.
As we are aiming to produce over 20x more cars by 2030 than we did in 2021, we will need to continue to build 
new factories and hire for those new locations. Gigafactories in Texas and Berlin will recruit extensively starting 
this year, which means that our job creation will continue to expand for quite some time. 
24Number of applicants continues to break records
By attracting, developing and retaining excellent talent, we've developed a pipeline of diverse and exceptional 
candidates while fostering an inclusive culture that supports them once they become employees.
Whether it is through our direct hiring opportunities, internships or workforce development programs, interest 
in joining Tesla’s mission is at an all- time high . We had more than 3,000,000 unique applicants globally in 2021 
alone.
We expanded access to hiring opportunities for underrepresented communities by centering diversity, equity 
and inclusion (DEI) in our hiring process. We did so by increasing gender -neutral language in our job 
descriptions, broadening our sourcing efforts, revamping interviewing guides, building community partnerships, educating on unconscious bias and facilitating training for recruiters, hiring managers and interview panelists.People and Culture

According to Universum 2021 rankings, engineering students want to work for T esla and SpaceX more than any 
other organization.Many successful companies with great engineering can become bureaucratic over time. We don’t want to go 
that route. At Tesla, great engineering ideas worth implementing can come from interns, analysts or executives. We strive to minimize red tape so our engineers can be creative and solve engineering problems that have 
never been solved.
Ultimately, the long -term success of any company comes down to the pace of innovation. It doesn’t matter how 
far ahead or far behind our technology is, what matters is the pace at which we’re evolving, implementing new 
ideas and engineering solutions. In order to maintain our pace of innovation we must continue to attract the 
best and the brightest to join our mission.People and Culture

have long stated publicly that candidates do not need to have a college degree to work at Tesla. This represents 
an enormous opportunity for high school graduates from underserved communities to join us in our mission and 
grow their careers.
Manufacturing Development Program
This is a two -year program where recent high school graduates in the U.S. start a career at T esla as a production 
associate while continuing their education in automation and robotics at a local community college. Since its 
launch in 2017, we've hired 168 graduates into this program, with active programs at Gigafactory Nevada, 
Gigafactory New York and our Fremont Factory. We also launched our first Manufacturing Development 
Program class with Del Valle High School to support Gigafactory Texas in fall 2021. 
Tool & Die Apprenticeship 
In partnership with local community colleges, Tesla offers a federal and state certified Tool & Die Apprenticeship 
program in the U.S. at the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada and T esla Grand Rapids. These apprenticeships 
blend on -the-job training by qualified mentors with classroom learning, providing a holistic approach to 
learning a trade in high demand. Apprentices learn welding, machining, blueprint reading and other critical 
skills. Similar programs run in Europe, including at the Gigafactory Berlin where we collaborate with local 
vocational schools and train students via facilitated workshops, self -led modules and on -the-job exercises for a 
variety of roles.People and Culture

27Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day & National Manufacturing Day
To promote gender diversity in STEM, since 2018, Tesla has encouraged girls to see engineering as a means to
pursue their goals by participating in Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. This year, over 1,200 middle school 
students from 140 schools across California, Nevada, Texas and New York joined the virtual event which 
showcased a variety of engineering career pathways and inspiring female Tesla engineers through virtual tours, 
engaging videos and hands -on STEM activities. Similar initiatives take place in Europe, like Girls’ Day, which is 
dedicated to girls who want to explore future career paths in the industry. Our aim is to encourage and inspire 
them via factory tour visits and conversations with our female employees and leaders.
Internship program
Our internship program continues to be our driving force in attracting diverse entry level professional talent. In 
our effort to expand access to our program, we attended more than 75 diversity hiring events targeting women 
and students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and launched new 
community Internship Initiatives with Say Yes Buffalo, Breakthrough Austin, TRiO Scholars in Nevada and 
College Track in the Bay Area to increase diversity in our program. 
K-12 education in Nevada
As part of our agreement to build Gigafactory Nevada, we committed to invest $37.5M into K -12 education 
beginning in 2018. This investment is in partnership with the Department of Education and the Education Gift 
Fund, with a focus on initiatives that support the acceleration of robotics, STEAM and sustainability 
programming. T o date, $22.5M has been invested across 30 organizations and an additional $17M planned in 
2022- 2023. 
Conference spotlight: Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers
The SHPE National Convention serves as the country’s largest annual gathering of Hispanic STEM students and 
professionals. We met over 3,000 students from various disciplines and had the opportunity to build some 
great relationships along the way with various SHPE chapter leaders in the country. Tesla’s DEI team also participated in the SHPETina series during the conference, which is a program that accelerates and affirms 
Latina representation at all levels of STEM corporate and academic leadership.People and Culture
Our Plan #1: Attracting
28Exceeding comparable manufacturing role compensation
Tesla provides a highly competitive wage that meets or exceeds the wages of comparable manufacturing roles, 
even before equity and benefits are factored in. In 2021, T esla’s average national wage for manufacturing jobs in 
the U.S. was $21.60/hour plus benefits (which, among others listed on the next page, includes an option for $0 
cost paycheck deductions) and equity, which is a 2.2% increase compared to 2020. According to the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, the mean hourly wage for Production Associates / Assemblers is $18.17 and the median is $17.59. Tesla continuously reviews salary and wages against benchmarks and adjusts to ensure wages are 
competitive. Evaluations for promotions also take place annually.
The impact of stock -based compensation can be material for employees
Our employees have benefited enormously from value appreciation of our stock seen through the years. While 
share prices will remain volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results, stock -based 
compensation brings shared ownership to the workforce, and our employees are encouraged to make a positive 
change for the benefit of all. Culturally, shared ownership of the company is one of the most essential attributes of working at Tesla. 
For example, assume that an employee received a grant of 320 Tesla shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares 
quarterly over 16 quarters (4 years). Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the quarterly vest of 20 
Tesla shares would equate to $1,331 -worth of sellable shares at the end of 2018. However, the same vest two 
years later would equate to $14,113 -worth of sellable shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per 
share of Tesla stock over that period. Employees are also eligible to buy additional stock at a discount through the Employee Stock Purchase Program.People and Culture

T esla HR offers a Pay Equity & Pay Transparency educational course to everyone in the People Organization, 
with a focus on HR partners and recruiters. This course details what pay equity is, why it is important, how 
unconscious bias affects pay and hiring, best practices for hiring and compensation, and how each person can 
be an effective partner in helping the company achieve and maintain pay equity. A recorded version of the 
course is available to all hiring managers.
We also have an annual pay equity program in place, designed to assess whether similarly situated employees 
are paid in a similar manner after accounting for a range of variables such as: 
•Geographic zone
•T enure (which determines how many grants are in the process of vesting) 
•Average performance score
•Job function
•Management level and rolePeople and Culture

2018 2019 2020 2021Employee Satisfaction Over Time — Glassdoor RatingsEmployee satisfaction is improving
When going through a challenging period or when the viability of a business is not yet clear, it’s likely to have 
an impact on employee satisfaction. Our early years of Model 3 production and global expansion were some of 
the most difficult in our history and our employee satisfaction ratings (Glassdoor) reflected that.
Our company is in a different phase now. Model 3 has become the best -selling premium sedan globally and 
profitability (operating margin) rose to the highest in the industry. This has fueled our ability to expand 
dramatically and provide career opportunities for many strong performers. Compensation, linked to the 
performance of the company, also improved substantially in recent years. 
There’s still a lot of work to be done, predominantly when it comes to work -life balance. Our goals have always 
been, and still are, bold. Expectations are understandably high as a result. We recently introduced unlimited 
vacation for salaried employees and added more family benefits. Both Glassdoor rankings as well as our internal 
data show that our employees are becoming happier as a result of our growing success as well as our expanded 
employee benefit programs. People and Culture
Our Plan #3: Retaining34Majority of promotions are internal
We believe our employees should have opportunities without limitations. Employees that start in junior roles 
can ultimately become company leaders – and many of our long -term employees have done exactly that.
Upward mobility in our fast environment is a significant contributor to retaining top talent. We want to make 
sure that our employees continue to learn and evolve.
As nearly 70% of our leadership is promoted from within Tesla, our employees are surrounded by examples of 
successful progression. Our global headcount increased by over 40% in 2021. At that pace of growth, some level 
of external hiring will be necessary. If possible, we do our best to fill each leadership role with an internal candidate.People and Culture

Integrating Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) principles and practices into the DNA of our company
In 2020, we instituted quarterly diversity data reviews across different divisions. These ensure that we identify 
trends across functions instead of simply looking at our workforce at the company -wide level. Executives review 
organizational demographics and work with their DEI, HR and Recruiting partners to create an action plan to 
attract, develop and retain talent.
That same year, we also took steps to incorporate DEI principles into talent management. The fundamental pillar 
in this strategy is consistent and fair performance reviews —a reliable review process leads to more equitable 
access to internal opportunities. Since 2020, we have routinely delivered performance reviews to over 99% of all 
employees globally. The program has led to improvements in our internal mobility program and employees' 
access to career opportunities within Tesla.
We expanded our leadership development team with a focus on providing DEI offerings to all our U.S. 
employees. Now all employees are introduced to our DEI principles on their first day as part of orientation and 
can continue their DEI learning journey throughout their time at T esla. From our allyship resources, to DEI Life Hacks on our DEI Knowledge Center, to virtual instructor led courses on unconscious bias, inclusive interviewing 
and inclusive leadership, our employees have access to information no matter where they are.
Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion principles
Our DEI team uses a people- first and data -driven approach to champion diversity, equity and inclusion in our 
business and in the communities in which we operate. We rely on the following guiding principles:
•Provide transparency in our DEI programs, identify areas of improvement, celebrate successes and 
continually iterate and improve our DEI approach
•Integrate accountability measures into our business operations
•Focus on sustainable solutions that solve problems at the root cause and reimagine new programs with DEI principles embedded in the design
•Share knowledge throughout all levels of the organization to aid in personal and professional learning and developmentPeople and Culture

Diversity, Equity & InclusionDiversity data (EEO -1) for U.S. employees: Tesla is a majority -minority company
We are proud to be a majority -minority company with a large representation of employees from communities 
that have long struggled to break through the historic roadblocks to equal opportunity in the U.S. As of 
December 31, 2020, 34% of our directors and vice presidents were non -white. This is a large percentage, 
considering that just 0.3% of our employees are director level and above at Tesla.
We are working to increase minority representation in professional and management categories through our 
intentional recruiting efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, 
activations at the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Engineers, AfroTec h , as well as 
community partnerships with organizations like College Track and Black Girls Code. We are also working to 
ensure that the diversity in our entry -level roles will, over time and because of internal movement, be reflected 
in our leadership roles.

ensured our programming was accessible in a remote work environment. We welcomed Asian Pacific Islanders 
at T esla to our ERG family. While this was a time of uncertainty and change, through our ERGs, we ensured our 
employees felt more heard and connected than ever before as they pivoted to virtual events to promote inclusion across different locations, physical boundaries and time zones.
At Tesla, we strive to have a diverse supply chain and create the maximum practical opportunities to provide 
goods and services as a part of the corporate procurement process. We formalized collaboration between the 
DEI, Supply Chain and Government Affairs teams to ensure local minority, women, LGBTQ+, disabled and veteran owned businesses are connected to opportunities with Tesla. We recognize that supplier diversity 
creates a competitive advantage for the company and has a positive impact on the global community. As the

As the company continues to hire tens of thousands of workers per year, educating our workforce is a top 
priority and an ongoing process.

Respectful WorkplaceHow we're meeting our commitments to equal opportunity employment and a diverse and inclusive 
environment
We believe it’s essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment where all 
employees can achieve their potential. As a result, we do not tolerate discrimination, harassment or any 
mistreatment of employees in the workplace or work -related situations. Below are some of the actions we are 
taking to ensure the proper treatment of all employees.
Training: Code of Business Ethics and harassment & discrimination training for front -line leaders, HR partners 
and other employees to understand how to create and promote a respectful workplace, assess situations sooner 
and escalate appropriately.
Internal Tracking System Enhancement: An enhancement to our internal tracking system now allows HR to 
document all employee concerns that are raised to ensure there is follow through and resolution for tracking 
purposes. Additionally, handling concerns at the initial stage helps prevent them from becoming bigger issues. 
The case management system also allows the appropriate teams to review data to trend and issue spot, which then can lead to proactive solutions before concerns arise.
Internal Mobility: Aprogram that advocates for and provides equal access to employee advancement 
opportunities and retention with eligibility for opportunities based on standardized performance reviews. 
Opportunities are advertised on an internal site with career resources in addition to a monthly newsletter. We 
also offer 1 -on-1 support and personal consultations to understand the career aspirations of internal applicants.
Third -party managed integrity line
We encourage employees to raise concerns internally or externally. An employee can raise concerns or complaints to any member of management, Human Resources or Employee Relations (ER). If they prefer to 
report another way, the Integrity Line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Integrity Line allows 
employees to report concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation.
If any employee raises a good faith concern, HR, together with ER, will ensure that employee concerns are 
investigated promptly and impartially in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. The Employee Relations 
team engages in feedback loops with leaders and HR to provide guidance on any appropriate follow -up actions, 
which range from additional communication and training to corrective action and discipline up to termination of 
employment.
44Why engagement matters for retention
Employee engagement drives productivity, satisfaction and loyalty and plays a critical role in employee 
retention. Tesla’s engagement initiatives strive to make employees feel informed, valued and respected, while 
company -wide open -door policies with leaders empower employees to make their ideas heard. When we feel 
connected to the T esla community and mission, we unlock our full potential as a workforce.
What we are doing to keep employees engaged
To promote engagement, we lead initiatives driven by employee feedback. Throughout the year, we use 
roundtables, engagement surveys and other feedback forms to gather data and better understand the 
employee experience.
Our team uses this data to inform our communication strategies. In addition to a monthly newsletter emailed to 
all U.S. employees and physically posted at manufacturing sites, we launched a new company -wide internal 
news platform with weekly updates on company news, employee recognition and events.
We highlight business, people and safety updates via both email and an expansive network of video screens. In 
2021, we also produced two live and virtual companywide all- hands.
These channels pair with the revitalization of daily Start -Up meetings for assembly workers to streamline 
communications across the Fremont Factory. HR members also staff on -site Answer Bar kiosks to address 
employee questions and concerns at many of our office locations.
Engagement requires making resources more accessible. This translates to regular on -site tabling and fairs for 
benefits, as well as making information available digitally. We manage internal resource websites for product 
knowledge, employee perks, recognition, employee volunteering, health and fitness and offer virtual info 
sessions with subject matter experts.People and Culture

Disaster ReliefSupporting Ukraine
We are committed to providing disaster relief through product donations. Our relief efforts to the conflict in 
Ukraine have provided people with the ability to communicate and power communities. 
In March 2022, Tesla employees in Europe volunteered to design, prototype and deploy the first 50 kits 
containing Powerwalls, Gateways and solar inverters to support continued energy access in Ukraine. When 
paired with one of the 250 solar panels dispatched by volunteers at Gigafactory Berlin, these mini power plants 
can assist Ukrainian communications and essential services indefinitely by using solar to recharge Powerwalls.
Along with Starlink Terminals used for satellite internet access (made by SpaceX), the kits were shipped to the 
Ukranian border in Poland, at which point they were transferred onto military trucks. The kit can begin providing 
power almost instantly, without any tools or technical experience required. W ith the Powerwall kit alone, a user 
can power Starlink for five days . With solar panels installed and operational, the kits can provide indefinite 
power for Starlink Terminal, plus a small appliance or laptop.
Surrounding European countries
In addition to product donations, Tesla has opened free Supercharging at all stations in Poland, Slovakia and 
Hungary to support those impacted by the recent events. Within hours of implementation, Tesla emailed local 
owners announcing that several Supercharger stations near Ukraine could be used by T esla and non- Tesla 
electric vehicles, free- of-charge.46People and Culture
Disaster ReliefHurricane Ida
In the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, T esla worked with NGO partners such as the Footprint Project, and certified 
installers in the New Orleans Area (Solar Alternatives, Posigen ) to deploy Powerwall and solar panel disaster 
relief systems. We deployed 14 systems to over 10 sites, including food distribution centers, churches, a 
warehouse, a fire station, a shelter and command center for NGOs. Most systems stayed in place for six weeks 
while the grid was down; in cases where the building was too damaged to return power after the grid was back up the systems remained in place for substantially longer. Our partners estimate that these systems provided 
power to over 1,000 people including recovery workers, food distribution volunteers and first responders.
Kentucky Storms
After the Kentucky winter storms, we deployed two systems at a research and education center in Princeton, 
Kentucky in partnership with the Footprint Project. These systems helped power communications trailers and 
mobile offices for over 50 recovery workers. They are still deployed while the center is being rebuilt and we are 
exploring ways to turn the trailers and mobile offices into a training center for future recovery workers.
Texas Winter Storm
In February 2021, Texas experienced a weather event that caused the widespread loss of power for several days 
affecting thousands of residents. Tesla provided a disaster relief system to Pathways Youth & Family Services, 
Inc., a non- profit social service organization providing foster care, adoption and behavioral health services to 
communities across Texas. The system consisted of four mobile Powerwall units (for a total of ~100kWh of batteries and 40kW of power). With this system, Pathways was able to restore heat and power to its facilities, 
enabling it to resume housing and other social services to children.
47In 2021, our focus remained on protecting people, the planet, our property and products. We were able to 
improve our performance in Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHS&S) by turning to the experts in 
Tesla –our own employees. We evolved the way we define safety, developed internal tools to drive execution, 
actively sought worker improvement suggestions and established a more structured EHS&S audit program to 
identify safeguards and drive operational excellence throughout all areas of the business.
Our EHS&S strategy remains focused on three pillars:
1. Do the Basics Right |2. Engage and Empower Our Stakeholders |3. Reduce Risk
Changing how we define safety and build capacity: Human and Organizational Performance (HOP) and 
Operational Learning
As we grew and evolved as an EHS&S organization, so did our view of safety. The Human and Organizational 
Performance (HOP) and Operational Learning group was developed in 2021 to integrate our new view of safety 
into the organization.
In an ever -changing and dynamic work environment, we recognized the need to focus on creating the ability to 
fail safely. Creating the ability to fail safely is comprised of three components:
1.Engaged workers: workers who are connected to and care about the work they do. When workers are 
engaged, they are more likely to identify and communicate vulnerabilities in the system.
2.Agility: the ability to continuously navigate and adapt in an ever- changing, complex and dynamic work 
environment.
3.Safeguards: the hardware, software and human actions that directly prevent an event or mitigate a bad 
outcome.
Instead of defining safety as the absence of accidents, we define safety as the presence of capacity. Capacity 
can be defined as the ability to mitigate outcomes and reduce system brittleness.People and Culture

48Develop tools to drive execution of EHS&S —MyEHS
In order to build capacity and allow our workers to fail safely, we needed a more dynamic approach to how we 
collect and manage data that allows us to make decisions that reduce risk. In response to that need, we 
developed an internal EHS&S tool named MyEHS to help drive execution and improve outcomes by allowing the 
intake and visualization of data globally. We designed and deployed 11 modules in 2021, allowing us to better manage our EHS&S information, identify emerging risks and take action to implement improvements suggested by our employees.
Foremost in this effort was our improvement suggestion module —Take Charge. Combined with Action Tracker, 
this module allows workers to submit improvement suggestions in various categories, including environment, 
health, safety, security, people and accuracy, while connecting with their supervisors and other work groups to 
identify and implement solutions to improve the presence of safeguards.
Take Charge case study —Sherry Ihrig
Leading the way with Take Charge submissions is Sherry Ihrig , with over 1,800 improvement suggestions to 
safety, processes, cost -savings and more since the program’s start in early 2021.
“Tesla promotes the concept that ‘safety is a shared responsibility,’ and the Take Charge program truly 
empowers me to take a more active role in sharing that responsibility,” Ihrig said.
“The Take Charge program encourages associates to increase their awareness of the work environment,” Ihrig
said. “When these and other potential safety hazards are noticed and resolved, it allows associates to improve 
their overall work performance.”
While Ihrig has enjoyed many parts of her experience at T esla, from teaming up with “hardworking, outgoing 
individuals” to learning how to operate a fire extinguisher in emergency response training, the most exciting 
part has been the Take Charge program.
Engaged employees like Sherry help Tesla build capacity to ensure safeguards are in place and functioning, so 
that when we fail, we fail safely.People and Culture

Since the emergence of COVID -19 in 2019 and the subsequent variants, we have proactively protected our 
workers. T eams have contributed to country, state and local regulations to ensure the voice of industry was 
represented in the drafting and implementation of policies.
Our pandemic management team continues to engage with employees at all levels. We consistently re -examine 
operations through risk assessments as a key element for managing the ever- changing COVID -19 work 
environment. Our dedicated Infectious Disease Team aggressively monitors on -going changes across the world 
to stay healthy and compliant with the differences in localities.Stats:
•Conducted 59 free, on -site COVID -19 vaccination clinics
•Administered 14,811 COVID- 19 vaccinations
•Received vaccination and booster information from 48% of employees using our internal tracking system,

•Gifted employees $86,500 in cash and prizes to encourage vaccinations
Compliance & Audit Group Established
We established the Compliance Audit Program in 2021 to provide an objective assessment of the management 
of EHS&S risk at a site level throughout the various businesses. We have conducted 31 audits so far that:
•Focused on compliance with T esla EHS&S standards and regulatory requirements
•Engaged site -level EHS&S professionals to audit other Tesla sites, maximizing technical knowledge across the 
businesses
•Identified best practices that can be replicated across other sites
•Provided guidance and assistance to sites addressing and closing out corrective and preventive actions
The audit outcomes provided opportunities for workers to identify and employ improvement solutions, adjust 
to the changing work environment where necessary, verify and validate existing safeguards, and implement new 
safeguards and improve our overall capacity.

Safety –MetricsAs our production volumes increase, focus on safety remains strong
As we continue to increase production, our focus remains on maintaining positive safety records. Weexamine 
our safety data to identify emerging risks, comparable events for innovative solutions and to better understand 
how we can systematically improve across our highest risk areas to help keep our people, the planet, our 
products and property safe.
We have turned our attention away from traditional OSHA metrics, but we continue to maintain information on 
them for regulatory purposes. We use these metrics, amongst many others, to examine how how we can see the 
results of our commitment to safety.
This will be the last year that we present recordable injuries per car produced –which captures all injuries and 
illness regardless of their severity or relation to work. Instead, we will use the American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) standard E2920 -19.ASTM better represents our global reach and more clearly illuminates 
serious injuries and illnesses, allowing our focus to remain on preventing and mitigating outcomes of our 
highest -risk activities.

Safety –MetricsHow we measure success globally — prevention of serious injuries and fatalities
We transitioned to the ASTM standard E2920 -19 as our global metric in 2020 to better reflect our global 
presence and have an increased focus on serious injuries and illnesses. Other automakers have not yet adopted 
this standard, so we are benchmarking against other manufacturing and service industries. We made this 
change in response to studies indicating the statistical invalidity of previous metrics (Total Recordable Injury 
Rate [TRIR]) as measures of safety outcomes.
We continue to concentrate our prevention and mitigation efforts in our highest risk areas across all lines of 
business and are accelerating forward with our strategies to ensure essential safeguards are in place and 
functioning. In 2020, COVID –19 impacted our operations including the shutdown of the Fremont Factory; 
therefore, we are using 2021 as our baseline year.
Sadly in 2021, Tesla experienced a fatality which occurred during a vehicle test drive outside of the U.S. 
Extensive global actions have been implemented based on our operational learning including limiting speeds 
and designated test drive routes.

Safety –Constructing Our FutureConstructing Our Future
In 2021, we kicked off our Constructing Our Future initiative that focused on empowering our project teams and 
partners to accelerate contractor onboarding as well as to simplify our requirements to ensure work is 
conducted safely and effectively.
Rather than uploading a Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) completed off -site, contractors and suppliers are now 
expected to meet a Tesla Responsible Person and EHS&S professional at the location of work to complete a 
Pre-Work Risk Assessment.
Over 5,000 companies were onboarded, and 587 Tesla Responsible Persons (TRP) and Contractor Responsible 
Persons (CRP) were trained in the new process. This level of involvement resulted in increased contractor 
responsibility, improved communication and more thorough Pre -Work Risk Assessments, which identified 
critical and high -risk activities.
Shifting from a hazard -based approach to a risk -based approach provides a better opportunity for EHS&S 
success by discussing critical and high -risk operations.
In addition, we support the Constructing Our Future with written procedures, training resources and forms which are easily accessible to Tesla stakeholders. This strategic approach helps us create the framework 
necessary to build safely, efficiently and consistently.
We are on schedule to release the new and improved supplier and contractor onboarding and management system, Workforce Management, in the second quarter of 2022. This simple, scalable, centralized system will 
build on the efficiencies of the interim onboarding process and provide better visibility for managers and engineers to track performance.
We will report our contractor injury rates in the 2022 Impact Report.

Impact56
Introduction What Do We See As Impact?
The biggest environmental impact is achieved through early displacement of ICE vehicles and replacing them 
with EVs. Additionally, we want to displace fossil- based energy generation with renewable energy generation. 
As of the end of 2021, Tesla (including SolarCity prior to its 2016 acquisition by Tesla) has installed almost 4.0 
Gigawatts of solar systems and cumulatively generated over 25.0 Terawatt -hours ( TWhs ) of emissions- free 
electricity. For reference, that is more energy generated by our installations than the total energy Tesla has used 
to run all our factories since we began producing Model S in 2012 and electricity used to power all of our 
vehicles in that same period combined.
We are striving to always remain a net contributor to renewable energy generation. It is our goal to eventually 
have all our manufacturing energy needs satisfied through renewable sources where possible. Additionally, we 
are hoping to see more Tesla vehicle customers installing solar panels or Solar Roof along with a Powerwall to 
meet their own energy needs in a sustainable way.
Energy Generation vs. Energy Consumption (in TWh )57Introduction In addition to an updated Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) for Model 3 and Model Y, we are reporting total Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions and use -phase emissions of our vehicles
In this year’s report we are reporting our Scope 1 (direct emissions from our facilities) and Scope 2 (purchased electricity, heat, etc. for our facilities) emissions resulting from global operations. This information is not only 
important to benchmark our performance against other manufacturers but is also the first step to track 
progress as we continue to work to decarbonize our own operations. While the most important work we can do to reduce GHG emissions is through selling as many of our products as possible, we are also committed to 
reducing carbon emitted from our own operations longer term. This is not only the right thing to do, but it also 
makes business sense as we reduce the resource intensity of our processes. 
It is possible to fully decarbonize the manufacturing and use of EVs –this is economically unfeasible for ICE 
vehicles
We are often asked if electric vehicles (EVs) are more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE) 
vehicles. The environmental impact of zero -emission transport and energy products, like the products that Tesla 
produces and sells, is undeniably more positive than the GHG -emitting alternatives. This becomes more 
pronounced when determining the lifetime impact of EVs versus ICE vehicles, which requires looking at the entire lifecycle —from raw materials to use -phase emissions to disposal —and not just at vehicle usage 
emissions.
Variables often overlooked by other lifecycle studies:
•Using Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle T est Procedure (WLTP) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel/energy consumption data (both of which overestimate fuel -economy and underestimate 
emissions) rather than real- world data
•Not considering the higher energy efficiency of T esla’s powertrains
•Assuming the average EV needs a battery replacement at some point in its life (it doesn’t)
•Not considering emissions generated through the oil refining and the transportation process
•Using outdated data for the carbon impact of cell manufacturing6,500 miles
The manufacturing process of Model 3 and Model Y currently results 
in slightly higher GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion engine vehicle. However, based on the global weighted average grid mix, Model 3 and Model Y have lower lifetime emissions than an equivalent ICE after driving 6,500 miles.

vehicle (model year 2021) sold in the U.S. through its use -phase, 
excluding CO 2e emitted during the oil refining phase.Using only real- world data, not official NEDC, WLPT or EPA1consumption data
The most important variable in a lifecycle analysis of an automobile is real- world fuel consumption or electricity 
consumption, as applicable, which impacts the use -phase of the lifecycle. Various efficiency testing cycles such 
as NEDC, WLTP or EPA do not truly represent real -world fuel or energy consumption. Therefore, we used: 
EV energy consumption: Real world energy consumption based on 25 billion miles traveled Tesla Model 3 and 
Model Y vehicles, including energy losses during the charging process. 
ICE fuel consumption: Data provided by Consumer Reports, which reports model year 2020 mid -size premium 
sedans achieve 24.3 MPG on average. This translates to over 400 grams of CO 2e per mile once we account for 
emissions generated through the extraction, refining and shipment of oil.
The carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year of use, but for EVs, it should improve every year
Based on publicly available sales and fleet data, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly 
less than 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years before it is scrapped. Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its 
fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly. On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs 
has become “greener” over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid. Below, we show zero -
emission electricity generation capacity (including nuclear) in the U.S. since 2015. Even without factoring in any 
changes to federal policy or an acceleration of the adoption of renewables in the U.S. (which is likely), if current 
trends remain stable, emissions generated through EV charging should continue to decline over time.

This includes emissions from upstream supply chain, direct emissions from manufacturing and electricity 
consumption and use -phase emissions when charged from a grid with a generation mix that reflects the 
geographic distribution of Model 3 and Model Y deliveries in the U.S., Europe and China. Below are the lifecycle 
emissions scenarios we show, and the assumptions used in each of the charts on the following pages:
Average Premium ICE: The reference ICE vehicle is based on an average of mid -size premium sedans and mid -
size premium crossover SUVs, with a real- world fuel economy of 24.3 MPG.
Model 3/Y* Personal Use (Grid Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were principally 
charged at home from the grid.
Model 3/Y Ridesharing Use (Grid Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were used for 
ridesharing over one million miles using cell chemistry from Tesla energy products, charged from the grid.
Model 3/Y Personal Use (Solar Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were principally 
charged at home using a solar system and energy storage.
Model 3/Y Ridesharing Use (Solar Charged): What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were used for 
ridesharing over one million miles using cell chemistry from our energy products and if it were only charged 
using a solar system and energy storage.
Other assumptions:
•Charging a Model 3/Y using solar panels and a Powerwall adds emissions to the manufacturing phase while 
reducing use -phase emissions to as low as zero when 100% of charging is done using that system.
•We conservatively assume no additional renewable energy capacity on the grid during the life of the vehicle given the shape of the renewable energy adoption curve is still very much up for debate.
•Manufacturing phase emissions for Model 3/Y in the U.S. represent a Fremont -made vehicle, while 
manufacturing phase emissions in Europe and China represent a China -made vehicle.
* This year we have added the impact of Model Y to the emissions per mile calculation in our LCA. Given that Model 3 and Mode l Yhave 70%+ 
parts commonality and share many manufacturing processes their GHG footprints are very similar. We have decided to present the L CA as a 
weighted average of Model 3 and Model Y based on production share for each vehicle (for manufacturing phase emissions) and de livery volumes 
in each region (for use -phase emissions).

To put this in perspective, average GHG emissions from charging one New York -based Tesla vehicle equates to 
the emissions from an ICE vehicle with a fuel economy of 109 MPG (no such vehicle is on the market). Even 
when charging a T esla in Michigan, where approximately 60% of energy comes from natural gas and coal, the 
emissions from our vehicles still equates to the emissions from an ICE vehicle with 52 real -world MPG 
(considerably more in terms of EPA rated MPG). As more regions adopt sustainable energy solutions to generate power, emissions related to charging an EV from the grid will decrease even further.
EV customers can increase their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof and an energy 
storage solution, such as Powerwall, in their homes. This dramatically reduces the lifetime carbon footprint of an 
EV, even when accounting for the carbon footprint of both the solar panel/Solar Roof and Powerwall 
manufacturing and upstream supply chain.EV vs. ICE Vehicle Emissions per Mile

In Europe, the U.K. and EFTA (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), larger portions of energy 
generation come from either renewable sources or nuclear, which means that in Europe the use -phase emissions 
gap between ICEs and EVs is even wider than it is in the U.S.
On the other hand, since an average European driver covers fewer miles per year than a U.S. driver, emissions 
from the manufacturing phase are divided by fewer miles. While in the U.S., an average vehicle covers 200,000 
miles before getting scrapped, in Europe, total mileage is closer to 150,000 miles.
We used Austria as an example of how use -phase emissions should evolve once the European grid becomes 
greener. As seen in the chart on the right, in Austria, all -in lifecycle emissions of a personal, grid -charged Model 
3Y are over 3.5x lower than all -in lifecycle emissions of an equivalent ICE vehicle.EV vs. ICE Vehicle Emissions per Mile

In China, much of the grid is powered by coal. That said, even in this scenario, charging a T esla Model 3Y from 
the grid is still less emission intensive than running an ICE vehicle. Just like in Europe, we have assumed a 
vehicle lifetime of 150,000 miles.
We are expecting the grid mix in China to improve dramatically over time as China remains a dominant deployer 
and manufacturer of renewable energy. Sichuan Province (with a population of 81 million) is a great example of 
this. In this province, given the high percentage of renewable energy penetration, charging an EV from the grid 
is less polluting than charging an EV in most global countries or states.
In conclusion, even as of 2021, charging a Tesla Model 3Y in any of our major markets is more environmentally 
friendly than burning gasoline. Considering that vehicles are used for 17 to 20 years before getting scrapped, it 
is reasonable to assume that in the coming years, the gap in emissions per mile between EVs and ICEs will only 
get wider.EV vs. ICE Vehicle Emissions per Mile

Improving Powertrain EfficiencyMore efficiency than a Prius, performance of a Porsche
Tesla vehicles are among the most efficient EVs built to date. In the early days of Model S production, we were 
able to achieve energy efficiency of 3.1 EPA miles / kWh. Model Y All- Wheel Drive (AWD) achieves 4.1 EPA miles 
/ kWh, which makes it the most efficient electric SUV produced to date. The gap between Tesla AWD vehicle 
efficiency continues to stand out compared to competitors in the same segment. While achieving the best -in-
class energy efficiency, our AWD models can accelerate to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds (4.8s for Model Y) and 
reach a top speed of 145 mph (135 mph for Model Y). In isolation, high energy efficiency is already difficult to 
achieve, but getting both performance and efficiency is the tricky part.
Tesla Robotaxis will be even more energy efficient
The energy efficiency of T esla vehicles will continue to improve as we improve our technology and powertrain 
efficiency. It is also reasonable to assume that our high -mileage products, such as our future T esla Robotaxis , 
will be designed for maximum energy efficiency as handling, acceleration and top speed become less relevant. 
This will minimize cost for our customers as well as reduce the carbon footprint per mile driven.

1.  Building new, better designed and more efficient factories
Building a factory from the ground up with sustainability in mind can have a material impact on reducing energy 
use. For each component that requires less movement around the factory, and as we use fewer robots in the 
vehicle production process, energy consumption declines.
In our quest for constant improvement, we build each new factory to be better and more sustainable than the 
previous one. For example, at Gigafactory Texas, we chose highly efficient, insulated, low emissivity windows to 
reduce building heating and cooling demand. In addition, waste heat recovery from our compressors alone will 
offset over 1 MW of natural gas consumption for process heating. While we have already completed substantial 
improvements at Gigafactory Shanghai, further improvements will continue at Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg 
and Gigafactory T exas.Reducing Carbon Footprint Even Further

All our new factories are designed to be covered with solar panels. As of the end of 2021, we had installed solar 
panels with a capacity of 21,405 kW, with the vast majority installed on the roofs of Gigafactory Nevada, 
Gigafactory New York and our manufacturing facilities in California. We will continue to add more capacity to 
these and other facilities as space allows and as is economically feasible.
3.  Leveraging AI to make our factories more efficient
We are leveraging six years of sensor data from Gigafactory Nevada to train an artificial intelligence (AI) 
program to safely control 195 interconnected HVAC units, accounting for 6MW of total electrical load . In its first 
full year of operation, we have measured significant load reduction compared to baseline usage. For such comparison, we look at actual energy usage for the HVAC system for the two modes under the same conditions 
(operations in the factory, time of year, external temperature, etc.). AI control is expected to achieve significant 
energy savings for Tesla as it is scaled up to control a majority share of HVAC equipment at Gigafactory Nevada 
as well as HVAC equipment at other Gigafactories.Reducing Carbon Footprint Even Further

Tesla Manufacturing Footprint: 
Upcoming PlansWe will not be content until all our factories are carbon neutral, and there are other projects that we are 
working on to further reduce emissions. In order to reduce the cost of our vehicles and batteries, we also need 
to use less energy to produce them. Many of the projects created to achieve this goal were showcased at our 
Battery Day presentation in September 2020.
4.  Transitioning to in -house manufactured 4680 T esla cells, whose production process can reduce energy 
consumption by more than 70%
At Tesla’s 2020 Battery Day, we presented a novel way that cells can be manufactured using a dry electrode 
process. Current electrode production processes involve mixing liquids with cathode or anode powders and using massive machinery to coat and dry the electrode. Since this process involves large ovens, today’s cell 
production consumes a lot of energy. The new dry -electrode process allows for the direct transition from a 
cathode or anode powder to an electrode film, reducing energy consumption in the overall cell manufacturing 
phase by more than 70% based on our latest analysis.
5.  Utilizing renewable energy as much as possible throughout all our operationsWe plan to shift energy consumption toward renewables as quickly as possible throughout our operations, 
whether it is at our factories, sales, service or delivery locations or through our Supercharger network.

Distance Traveled (thousands of miles)Tesla Model S/X Battery Capacity Retention per Distance Traveled
Standard Deviation RetentionOur batteries are designed to function for the entire life of the vehicle
Tesla’s battery packs are designed to outlast the vehicle. We estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after 
approximately 200,000 miles of usage in the U.S. and roughly 150,000 miles in Europe. Creating a battery that 
could last for 1,000,000 miles (4,000 charging cycles) would dramatically reduce the emissions per mile driven 
for high -mileage vehicles such as taxis, delivery vans or trucks.
Producing Robotaxis is a core part of our mission. All vehicles in the world combined travel trillions of miles 
every year. A relatively small number of vehicles, such as taxis, delivery vans, trucks and buses account for a 
disproportionate amount of vehicle miles and, as a result, a disproportionate amount of emissions. A single future Tesla vehicle with a million -mile battery could be utilized over five -times more than an average vehicle in 
the U.S. After being fully optimized, and even once it is scrapped, a battery can still be recycled and its materials used in a brand -new battery.Reducing Carbon Footprint Even Further
Increasing Vehicle Utilization
Note: Mileage is only one factor in battery capacity retention; battery age is also a major factor. Retention figures at lowe r mileages above likely 
reflect the impact of age while higher mileage values, which come from high -utilization vehicles, likely reflect less influence from battery age.
Performance of newer chemistries (not yet shown here) can vary and we plan to expand disclosure once we have sufficient data.
68We can make the biggest impact on GHG emissions by selling as many of our products as possible. 
Undoubtedly, the use -phase of our products avoids more lifetime emissions than either our operations or our 
supply chain could. However, in support of our mission, we track and try to minimize emissions that result from 
our full value chain, including our supply chain, manufacturing processes as well as our sales, service and 
delivery activities.
In 2021, we began measuring our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions considering the principles and guidance 
of the GHG Protocol. We used the operational control approach methodology –accounting for GHG emissions 
from operations under our control. For detailed information on the scope of our calculations, please see page 139-142 of this report.
While our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions may increase on an absolute basis in the near term as we continue to open new factories, our goal is to reduce the emissions intensity from production as we push the 
boundaries of sustainable manufacturing and improve the efficiency of our operations. As part of our 
commitment to reducing our overall emissions in the long term we signed up for the Science -Based Target 
Initiative (SBTi) in 2021.GHG Emissions

Scope 3 GHG emissions calculations are highly academic, even those widely used and accepted like the GHG 
Protocol. Most companies lack primary data as it relates to their supply chain, product use and so on. Therefore, 
most Scope 3 GHG emissions reporting is done using lofty assumptions as well as estimates from databases –
this can lead to figures that are magnitudes off from the actual impact. T esla has begun to measure the two 
largest categories within our Scope 3 emissions: those from use of product and our supply chain.
Use of product emissions
Tesla has access to primary data from our over two million vehicles on the road and our fleet of solar and 
storage products —we can calculate our emissions at a much higher level of accuracy than most manufactures 
and can therefore develop emissions reduction solutions to match. This also means that we can calculate our use 
of product emissions year on year — we do not have to estimate emissions over the lifetime of the vehicle 
because we have primary data.
Supply chain emissions
Prioritizing our supply chain is crucial and we have a lot of work to do to incentivize suppliers to provide energy 
and emissions data for us to report on. We have already started to identify which materials and processes in our 
supply chain are key emitters so we can prioritize engagement and projects to address these emissions — see 
the Supply Chain section for more detail.
The good thing for us is that Tesla’s high level of vertical integration and our direct sourcing relationships mean we are positioned to manage upstream emissions better than most.
100% Renewable Supercharger networkEfficiency of an ICE vehicle does not improve throughout its lifetime. EVs will get cleaner over their lifetime as 
the grid becomes greener. We will continue to look for ways to enable our customers to further reduce their 
emissions beyond our vehicles — through solar and storage products and software to help differentiate when the 
grid is greener and pulling more renewable energy like solar or wind.
The global Supercharger n etwork was 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite 
resources and annual renewable matching. Additionally, all home charging in California was 100% renewable 
through annual renewable matching. Therefore, the only emissions from the use of Tesla vehicles were a result of 
home charging outside of California and use of third -party charging networks.GHG Emissions
Scope 3 Emissions 70Pollution from burning fossil fuels leads to eight million premature deaths globally each year 
According to recently published research in Environmental Research by Harvard University, in collaboration with 
the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London, air pollution causes 
over eight million premature deaths annually. That is double the previous estimate of deaths from the negative 
effects of fine -particle pollution and would account for one -in-five premature deaths worldwide. This is a major 
advantage of EVs that is often forgotten about as the overall EV debate tends to focus on greenhouse gases. 
EVs are not just about the future of our planet, but very much about addressing preventable deaths today.
While air -quality is often categorized as a problem in developing countries, Nitrogen oxide (NO x) and other 
PM2.5 particulates* cause significant issues in developed countries as well. In Europe alone, almost 800,000 
people die prematurely every year due to pollution -related illnesses. EVs not only reduce the world's total 
carbon footprint, but also help to reduce city pollution.NOx, Particulates and Other Pollutants

Combination Trucks Rest of Fleet17.9%
82.1%% of U.S. Vehicle Emissions
Combination Trucks Rest of FleetSemi offers an opportunity to have an outsized impact on GHG emissions from transport
Combination trucks –of which the vast majority are semi trucks – in the U.S. account for just 1.1% of the total 
fleet of vehicles on the road. That said, because combination trucks have high fuel consumption due to their 
weight and heavy utilization, they account for approximately 18% of all U.S. vehicle emissions. Electrifying the 
heavy -duty truck segment is an essential part of transitioning the world to sustainable energy.
Payload equal to a diesel truck
With both the U.S. and E.U. having approved higher weight allowances for electric heavy -duty trucks, we expect 
the payload to be at least as high as it would be for a diesel truck. In the E.U., electric semi trucks are allowed to 
be 2 tons (~4,400 pounds) heavier than diesel equivalents, and in the U.S. the allowance is 0.9 tons (2,000 
pounds). When fully loaded, the T esla Semi should be able to achieve over 500 miles of range, achieved through 
aerodynamics and highly efficient motors. This truck will be able to reach an efficiency of over 0.5 miles per 
kWh.
While most heavy trucking journeys are shorter than 500 miles, we want long -distance hauling to also be 
sustainable. We are in the process of developing a Semi charger network at trucking rest stops across the U.S. 
and Europe, where each T esla Semi could top up their range.Tesla Semi is critical to our mission to accelerate the world’s 
transition to sustainable energy. Right now, cell availability is 
the limiting factor for production –a Tesla Semi requires 
multiple times more cells than a passenger vehicle. 
72Waste Generated Per Vehicle Manufactured As we build more efficient factories, our waste per vehicle decreases
Building localized factories both makes sense economically and reduces waste. First, because the automotive 
supply chain doesn’t have a strong presence on the West Coast of the U.S., many components need to be 
shipped from long distances, requiring excessive packaging and creating more waste than necessary.
Second, modern factories are better designed for material flow. Trailer entry points surround the whole factory, 
which means that components can be offloaded precisely at the part of the factory where they are needed. Less 
material flow results in less waste, because a shorter journey requires less protective packaging. The chart 
below shows that waste generation per vehicle at Gigafactory Shanghai is less than half of what it is in the U.S. 
We are expecting our upcoming factories such as Gigafactory Berlin- Brandenburg and Gigafactory T exas to 
continue the same trend.
Any materials that are possible to recycle, we recycle
The vast majority of generated waste, such as paper, plastics and metals, is recyclable. At Gigafactory Shanghai, 
for example, just 7% of total waste generated in 2021 was not recyclable.
We push for innovative approaches to reducing waste, which includes reduction of non- recyclable materials in 
the first place, learning from local factories and deploying improvements globally or working with our logistics 
team to minimize shipments and packaging per vehicle.

73Water Used Per Vehicle Manufactured
Current StateWe currently use less water per vehicle than almost any ICE carmaker
There is a misconception that producing an EV requires more water than producing an ICE vehicle. Our data 
shows this is not the case. While each automaker may draw their boundaries slightly differently (depending on 
how vertically integrated they are), according to the latest publicly available figures, Tesla withdrew less water 
at facilities dedicated to vehicle manufacturing per vehicle produced than the majority of established 
carmakers. Furthermore, the efficient manufacturing design we are implementing at our new factories in T exas and Berlin -Brandenburg will result in further reductions in our water usage per vehicle. Our goal is to have 
industry -leading low water usage per vehicle, even when accounting for cell manufacturing. The below chart 
includes our latest estimates for water usage per vehicle at those facilities.
Water usage and power generation
While many recognize the impact that power generation has on GHG emissions, its impact on water 
consumption is less appreciated. Power generation is one of the leading causes of water withdrawal in the U.S., 
as water for thermoelectric power is used to generate electricity with steam -driven turbine generators andto 
cool power -producing equipment. This means that every kilowatt -hour (kWh) of clean solar energy produced 
not only lowers GHG emissions, but also lowers water consumption.

Vehicle Manufacturing Cell Manufacturing74Tesla factories are setting a new standard of water use per vehicle
Water is becoming increasingly scarce as the climate changes. That is why we are reducing our water usage 
throughout our operations as much as possible. We have prioritized direct use in manufacturing and will 
continue to explore the rest of our impact throughout the supply chain and in sales, service and delivery.
The “cooling tower makeup” is the single biggest contributor to water usage in any car factory after paint 
operations. As water that cools machinery evaporates, it needs to be topped up regularly. The total cooling 
tower makeup could be offset entirely by non -potable sources such as rainwater or wastewater. These are some 
of the initiatives we are taking at Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg and/or Gigafactory T exas in order to reduce 
water consumption per complete vehicle (including cells).
1.Water intensive process optimization: We are constantly looking into reducing water consumption by 
optimizing or eliminating water intensive production processes across our operations. At Gigafactory Berlin -
Brandenburg, we use hybrid cooling towers, have eliminated quench tanks in casting and introduced cascade 
rinsing systems in the paint shop and battery can wash process for cell manufacturing.
2.Rainwater and condensate harvesting and reuse: We are planning to capture at least 25% of roof runoff (1 
million square feet) to a central underground storage system within Gigafactory Texas. Rainwater will be 
recycled for use in the cooling of manufacturing equipment. In an average year, such systems should save an 
estimated 7.5 million gallons of potable city water. Additionally, as hot, humid outdoor air is conditioned, water 
condenses out of the air. Typically, this condensate is discarded as wastewater. At Gigafactory Texas, we reuse 
this condensate in our cooling towers and process water systems to offset incoming site water.
3.Reclaimed and recycled water (wastewater reuse): Using local treated wastewater could result in offsetting 
the entire annual cooling tower makeup water demand with non- drinkable uses. At Gigafactory Texas, this could 
result in an estimated 40 million gallons of potable city water conserved annually. Reclaimed water is available 
and under investigation for use at both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg.Water Used Per Vehicle Manufactured

2021Emissions credit systems around the world are designed to economically benefit companies with non -polluting 
products by allowing them to sell their credits to polluting companies. In order to meet various countries’ 
emission targets and avoid government fines, polluting companies pay non -polluting companies through credit 
purchases. The goal of this system is for every OEM to be incentivized to reduce emissions and themselves 
become non -polluting by selling more of their own manufactured EVs instead of paying another company for 
their non- polluting credits. 
Emissions credit revenue is used for EV capacity expansion, which in turn displaces ICEs
In 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in revenue selling zero -emission regulatory credits to other OEMs. 
Proceeds from such sales will go towards building new factories to produce EVs that will continue to displace 
ICE vehicles. While it is common practice today for ICE vehicle OEMs to purchase regulatory credits from other 
companies (such as Tesla) to offset their total GHG emissions, it is not a sustainable strategy. In order to meet 
increasingly strict regulatory requirements across the world, OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive 
EVs.
EV sales by all carmakers need to accelerate, taking market share from ICEs
In 2021, Tesla delivered almost 1 million EVs globally. We hope that every car manufacturer will strive to produce 
hundreds of thousands of EVs per year, as significant reduction of emissions will only be achieved if all 
carmakers push for an industry -wide shift to EVs.Emissions Credits

Consumers are unlikely to buy products only because they have a low lifetime carbon footprint. In order to 
convince consumers to buy our products, they need to be better in every way –performance, cost of ownership, 
safety, fun and more. We want to make products that people love.
Model 3 is the first EV to be priced on -par with ICE vehicle equivalents
Model 3 is the first EV in history priced competitively with its gas- powered equivalents, even before taking into 
consideration any regional subsidies and lower running costs. Unfortunately, most other EVs on the market 
today are often priced at over a $10,000 premium compared to their direct ICE vehicle equivalents.
There doesn’t need to be a tradeoff between sustainability, performance and affordability
Tesla’s ability to achieve our mission rests first and foremost on our products. We are not just trying to build the 
best electric cars, we are striving to build the best cars, period. Our focus from the beginning has been to develop products that are not only sustainable, but also superior to fossil- fuel alternatives in every way. Many 
incorrectly believe that choosing sustainable products requires consumers to compromise on price or 
performance, but Tesla vehicles combine performance, safety, efficiency and competitive prices. Similarly, 
T esla’s energy generation and storage products power both urban and remote communities with reliable, 
affordable energy.

(before subsidies or dealer incentives)78Over 5 years of average driving, the ownership costs of a Tesla Model 3 are closer to a Camry than a 3 Series
The accessibility of our products is fundamental to our mission. While the “sticker price” of Model 3 is similar to 
an equivalent BMW or Audi, the sticker price of a vehicle itself is only one of many cost items that need to be 
considered. The lifetime running costs of EVs are lower than those of ICE vehicles due to lower maintenance 
costs, cheap electricity and high residual value of used Tesla vehicles, the latter of which has remained exceptionally strong since our initial launch. As a result, Tesla Model 3 has a base price similar to BMW 3 Series, but the total cost of ownership per mile is closer to America’s best -selling sedan, the Toyota Camry*.
Cost data is based on data collected from our fleet
The advantage of having a fleet of vehicles that is constantly online is the ability to analyze real- world data 
rather than only being able to use estimates. We have an extensive database of Model 3 residual values and cost 
of repairs, maintenance, energy use, etc.  Additionally, the insurance cost for the Model 3 RWD below is based on 
the projected median insurance rate in the U.S. for Tesla Model 3 drivers. Our analysis shows that over five years 
and 60,000 miles, running a Model 3 RWD costs 63 cents per mile.
Notably, running costs such as fuel (electricity or gasoline), maintenance, tires and repairs for Model 3 should 
cost just over half of a mass- market ICE vehicle such as a T oyota Camry.

EVs as the Primary VehicleCustomers are using their Tesla as their main car
For an EV to have an impact on the environment, it must be genuinely displacing internal combustion engine 
miles, rather than sitting in the driveway as a secondary car used for errands or short trips only. Our data shows 
that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they are generally 
being used as a customer’s primary vehicle. We fundamentally believe that you shouldn’t have to choose 
between price, quality, usability and sustainability. An EV should be the best vehicle in every way, so consumers don’t ever need to use ICE vehicles.
The longer the range, the higher the usage
There is a clear relationship between range, how often an EV is utilized and whether it is a primary -use vehicle. 
The more confident owners are that their EV can be used for commuting, errands and long road trips, the less 
they will feel they need to supplement their EV with an ICE vehicle. Surveys consistently indicate that the real or 
perceived lack of EV range is the key reason why many people do not consider replacing their ICE vehicle with 
an EV.

80Freedom of travel is the reason people buy vehicles in the first place. To ensure we replace as many ICE vehicles 
with EVs as possible, we have been focused on increasing the range of Tesla vehicles. While most personal 
vehicle journeys are relatively short, and thus drivable on a single charge, consumers do not buy cars that can 
meet most of their driving needs; they buy a car that meets alltheir driving needs.
The longer the range, the lower the Supercharger use
Since its introduction in 2012, we have increased the range of the Model S by over 50%: from 265 miles to 405 
miles of range for the long -range version. Our focus on energy efficiency —achieving superior range from the 
same size battery —has allowed to us continue to increase range while keeping the battery size relatively 
stable. Our data shows that the longer the range of our vehicles, the less Supercharging T esla customers do. 
After all, day trips of over 400 miles are quite rare.
Super -fast charging: V3 Superchargers can increase range by up to 200 miles in just 15 minutes
Around 300 miles of range at highway speeds is equal to roughly four hours of driving. At that stage, drivers 
are often likely to take a break. We want to make sure that such a break can be relatively short before 
continuing the journey. Our latest generation of Superchargers can recover up to 200 miles of range in just 15 
minutes of charging, long enough for a quick break and snack.
Substantial coverage and 99.96% reliability
We’re aware that the chart showing Supercharger uptime looks silly, but that’s kind of the point. While coverage 
is important, uptime is essential. Few things are as frustrating as arriving to a charging station with a near -
empty battery, realizing that none of the charging plugs are working. In 2021 alone, we opened 912 new 
Supercharger locations around the world for a total of nearly 3,500 charging locations with over 31,000 plugs.

81Safety Is Our Top Design Priority

In addition to designing and building cars with the highest levels of real- world safety, we've also been working 
on ways to help our customers drive as safely as possible. Through our T esla Insurance program, we do just this 
by providing real time feedback to customers and incentives for safe driving such as reductions in monthly 
insurance premiums.
Customers who choose to be a part of this program receive a Safety ScoreBeta. This score changes based on 
driving behavior and the insurance premium changes with it. Instead of determining a driver’s insurance 
premiums from demographic information (gender, age, education, or marital status) and financial history (credit score), our algorithm calculates Safety Score
Betabased on actual driver behavior. The behaviors we monitor are: 
•Forward Collision Warnings
•Hard Braking
•Aggressive Turning
•Unsafe Following (Tailgating) 
•Forced Autopilot Disengagement  
Our data show a lower rate of collision for the cohort of customers who have enabled Safety ScoreBeta.  As the

Driver Behavior
083Our commitment to safety is why all Tesla vehicles built since October 2016 come with a suite of external 
cameras, additional sensors and onboard computing that enable advanced safety features like Automatic 
Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Forward and Side Collision Warning, Obstacle -Aware 
Acceleration, blind spot warnings and more —all of which continue to improve over time through software 
updates. We recently introduced active safety features that go beyond the norm:
Traffic Light & Stop Sign Warning
When a driver doesn’t notice a red light or a stop sign, our cars will notice that vehicle’s speed is too high. 
Thanks to our eight -camera system, each vehicle can recognize a traffic light that is specific to vehicle’s 
trajectory as well as a stop sign. A loud warning is triggered to alert the driver.
Pedal Misapplication Mitigation (accelerator pressed inadvertently)
Pressing the accelerator pedal when the circumstances indicate you should be pressing the brake instead, like 
when pulling into a parking space, is relatively common no matter what vehicle you're in. However, if you are in a Tesla, when our cameras recognize an object in front of the car, “Pedal Misapplication Mitigation” system cuts 
torque from the electric motor to prevent a collision if you happen to press hard on the accelerator. This 
technology has prevented or mitigated hundreds of collisions every month.
Active avoidance of lane departure or a blind -spot collision
If a driver is changing into a lane while a vehicle in the blind spot is entering the same lane, or if our vehicle 
starts departing its lane without an indicator, our vehicles will sound a warning and assist the steering to avoid a 
collision.Vehicle Safety

Safety Assist RatingsNot all Active Safety systems are created equal
Many people assume that AEB (Automatic Emergency Breaking) –a system that most new vehicles are 
equipped with –works equally well with all vehicles. That’s not the case. The range of sensors, compute power 
and quality of software in the system can vary dramatically. Our active safety features are powered by eight 
cameras, a neural -net computer and learnings from our fleet of over two million cars. 
After the introduction of Tesla Vision (a vision -only system that excludes radar), our active safety ratings with 
IIHS improved. Pedestrian AEB performance of our Tesla Vision was over 45% better than performance of vision 
+ radar. It is no surprise that the active safety score achieved by Tesla Model 3 Euro NCAP remains an outlier.

Vehicle Fleet*Numbers of Vehicular Accidents per Million Miles Driven (2021)86Tesla strives to go beyond industry standard testing by using real- world data from our fleet of over two millions 
cars on the road. Historically, the aim of manufacturers has been to design their vehicles to perform well for a 
suite of regulatory and consumer tests. There are too many common impact scenarios (visible in the heatmap 
below) that are simply not covered by regulatory crash tests. The richness of data we are collecting enables us 
to develop safety in allscenarios, not only the ones covered by regulation and ratings. 
Algorithm, Trained By Fleet, Triggers Optimal Safety Responses
We analyze data from our fleet to find solutions, which we then update via over -the-air software updates. Our 
algorithm uses vehicle sensor data and, within tens of milli- seconds of impact, determines what type of impact 
has occurred and triggers the seatbelt pretensioners and airbags to respond in the most optimal way down to 
the millimeter and mile per hour. Tesla engineers are also in the final stages of evaluating a system which uses 
Autopilot to identify when a crash is imminent. This gives Tesla vehicles an uncanny ability to predict potential collisions and respond faster to an impact when it does occur.Vehicle Safety

We use field data, data analytics and simulations to inform our design and safety engineers’ work on future 
products and to send software improvements to our existing fleet via over -the-air updates. Tesla is also sharing 
data and statistics collected by our vehicles with select regulatory bodies and external research organizations —
in an anonymized fashion or with consent and in accordance with local data privacy laws — giving them access 
to an unprecedented opportunity to understand crashes in the real world. This access to data will accelerate 
impact safety research, driving change across the safety industry and improved safety outcomes for all vehicles 
to protect lives.
Post-Crash Data Analysis
After we send new software to the fleet, we wait for new data to come through to understand the efficacy of 
the system once it is deployed in the real world. Since deployment of our ‘ offzone ’ side algorithm (data -driven 
safety), we learned that of the total vehicles that had their airbags deployed, 15% of those deployed due to our 
new algorithm in these new modes. This confirms our expectations and highlights how effective fleet -based 
learnings and rapid deployment of novel solutions can be. 
Why Airbags Sometimes Don’t Deploy
In a fairly common “small overlap” collision as the one shown below, front sensors are unlikely to pick up a side 
collision, as they are usually designed to detect a frontal collision. And side sensors are usually too close to a 
driver window to detect a collision far in the front. We designed our sensors and their positions in a way that 
they can pick up nearly every type of collision and deploy airbags if necessary. Vehicle Safety

Restraints Deployments Since Introducing Data -Driven Algorithm

Restraints deployment not covered by regulation88Safety starts with our clean sheet design
Improving occupant safety has always been key to our mission. All our vehicles are built off a safety -first 
architecture with a low center of gravity (thanks to the positioning of our battery) and enhanced frontal impact 
safety (thanks to the front trunk that is void of the engine found in forward engine ICE vehicles).
Added benefit of enhanced performance
Based on the advanced architecture of Model S and Model X, we engineered Model 3 and Model Y to be some 
of the safest cars built to date, anywhere. Even though Model 3 and Model Y have no engine, their performance is similar to a “mid -engine internal combustion car” due to a centered battery pack and the fact that the rear 
motor is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather than behind it. Not only does this architecture add to the overall agility and handling of the car, but it also improves stability control effectiveness by minimizing 
rotational kinetic energy.
Model 3 and Model Y score 5 -stars in all USNCAP categories 
After putting Model 3 and Model Y through a series of crash tests used as part of the New Car Assessment 
Program to calculate the likelihood of serious bodily injury for front, side and rollover crashes, the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) awarded each top safety ratings of 5 -stars in every category 
and subcategory.
Tesla has pioneered the state- of-the-art way of improving a vehicle’s safety over time
A hallmark of Tesla ownership is connectivity. We are an industry leader in deploying over -the-air (OTA) 
software updates to our vehicles. These updates are integral to – and continuously enhance – the customer 
experience, and they can include improvements to customer safety or a remedy to a recall. OTA updates can be installed at a customer’s convenience without a trip to a Tesla Service Center.Vehicle Safety

When the media reports a story about a vehicle fire, it is usually reporting on an EV fire. This is likely a result of 
chasing clicks, rather than the prevalence of EV -related fires compared to ICE vehicle- related fires. The reality is, 
when compared to Tesla vehicles, ICE vehicles catch fire at a vastly higher rate. According to the latest available 
data, in 2020, there were almost 173,000 vehicle fires in the U.S. alone.  
From 2012 to 2021, there has been approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled. By 
comparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation 
show that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle fires for every billion miles travelled.  
In order to provide an apt comparison to NFPA data, Tesla’s data set includes instances of vehicle fires caused 
by structure fires, arson and other reasons unrelated to the vehicle, which account for some of the T esla vehicle 
fires over this time period.
We continue to improve safetyWe continue to improve our battery chemistry, cell structure, battery pack structure and vehicle passive safety 
in order to decrease fire risk to as close to zero as possible. As Tesla’s vehicle technology continues to improve, 
fires will be even less likely for our EVs.
Tesla has partnered with European and Australasian NCAPs to provide free mobile app -based emergency

Matching Energy Demand & SupplyCommercial scale customers: Megapack and renewables
The beauty of selling commercial storage systems such as Megapack is that purchasing such a product is almost 
purely a mathematical decision for our commercial customers. If installing Megapack makes economic sense, 
there is no reason not to install one. A single Megapack has on average 3,000 kWh worth of battery storage 
capacity, and given its scalability, enables projects over 1,000,000 kWh. Tesla Energy continues to be 
dependent on the global supply chain, including cell supply. In 2021, in order to meet demand that is well in excess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new production facility capable of 
producing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year.

92Pairing energy storage with renewables enables cost -effective decarbonization of the grid
The best way to avoid blackouts is to reduce your reliance on the grid. Tesla is a one -stop shop for taking our 
customers off -grid by covering a large variety of their needs. In 2021, Tesla sold 4 GWh worth of energy storage 
products, more than 15% of the 25 GWh global market*. Some of these projects were massive deployments, 
including a 371 MWh installation in California and a 497 MWh installation in Victoria, Australia. In order to switch 
global energy usage to renewable sources, we estimate that global annual battery storage production will need to increase to ~10,000 GWh.
Residential customers: Solar Roof, solar panels and Powerwall
Anyone can dramatically reduce their carbon footprint by installing Solar Roof or solar panels with Powerwall. 
In theory, all U.S. domestic electricity needs, as well as vehicle transportation needs, could be met by sunlight 
alone. Naturally, installation of such a system needs to make financial sense for the customer. In Massachusetts, 
for example, we estimate that an average solar and storage system pays for itself with energy cost savings 
within approximately 10 years. As the cost of these products continues to decline, more customers will be willing to switch to solar and storage purely due to lower overall cost.

Grid outages are becoming more common
Electrical disturbances in the U.S. are becoming more common, predominantly due to weather and natural 
disasters. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electrical disturbances cost businesses $150 billion per 
year. It is not surprising that homeowners and businesses are increasingly turning to backup power supply 
options. Our solar and energy storage products are a great way to reduce emissions while also ensuring backup 
power during outages. 
Low cost is key to mass adoption
We are continuously working on reducing the cost of our products in order to foster mass adoption. Ultimately, 
using renewable energy (such as solar or wind) with battery storage will become the cheapest energy option 
available, regardless of location. This is already the case in many, but not all, locations around the world. As the 
cost continues to decline, more customers will be able to financially benefit from turning to renewable energy.

Improving Resilience Of The Grid94
Supply
Chain95
What do we see as impact?
Protecting human rights and the environment is core to our procurement strategy. T esla creates our products 
from many different materials and components, some of which we purchase from our direct (Tier 1) suppliers. 
Many of our Tier 1 suppliers do not purchase all their raw materials directly, rather they get them from their 
suppliers and sub -suppliers around the world through a complex supply chain. Though we believe that battery 
recycling will play a critical role in supplying a portion of these materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, 
we recognize that global battery cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to 
meet the growing demand for our products.
In line with our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, Tesla is committed to ensuring 
that companies in our supply chain respect human rights and protect the environment. Our goal is that where 
Tesla’s supply chain touches, local conditions for stakeholders continuously improve as a result of our 
purchases. Our responsible sourcing strategy has the following objectives:
1.Increase the share of materials we source directly from suppliers, and those closer to our factories 
(supply chain localization); and  
2.Continue to source globally, to contribute to the improvement of local conditions in our sourcing communities. 
Mapping GHG emissions in the battery supply chain is one of our top priorities
Upstream GHG emissions from manufacturing an EV battery –from raw material extraction through refining and 
transportation of materials –can be meaningful. We estimate that these specific activities cause up to ~80% of 
the total emissions of a Model 3 battery pack, with the largest contributors at the chemical processing stage. 
Our battery supply chain GHG emissions hotspot analysis –an industry first –is on page 104 of this report.Supply Chain

Extracting raw 
materialsA common question we receive is: “What happens to T esla battery packs once they reach the end of their life?” 
An important distinction between fossil fuels and lithium -ion batteries as an energy source is that while fossil 
fuels are extracted and used once, the materials in a lithium -ion battery are recyclable. When petroleum is 
pumped out of the ground, chemically refined and then burned, it releases toxic emissions into the atmosphere 
that are not recoverable for reuse. Battery materials, in contrast, are refined and put into a cell and will remain in 
the cell at the end of their life when they can be recycled to recover valuable materials for reuse, repeatedly.
Longer battery longevity is the most sustainable option
Battery pack life extension is the superior option to recycling for both environmental and business reasons. 
Before decommissioning and recycling a consumer battery pack, T esla does everything it can to extend the 
useful life of each pack, including sending out over -the-air software updates to Tesla vehicles to improve battery 
efficiency when our engineers find new ways to do so. In addition, any battery that is no longer meeting a 
customer’s needs can be serviced at a Tesla Service Center.
Every battery used in R&D or returned from the field that cannot be re -manufactured is recycled
Tesla batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles and our energy storage products, are made to last 
many years, and therefore, we have received a limited number of them back from the field. Most batteries that 
Tesla recycles today are pre- consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control. None of our scrapped 
lithium -ion batteries go to landfills and 100% are recycled. Furthermore, Tesla has an established internal 
ecosystem to re -manufacture batteries coming from the field to our Service Centers. We actively implement 
circular economy principles and consider all other options before opting for battery recycling.
The small number of post -consumer batteries that we receive are primarily generated from our fleet of vehicles 
on the road, predominantly from taxi -like vehicles. Since we have only been producing Model S (our oldest 
model) for approximately ten years, and our energy storage products for even less time, it will likely be some time before we start receiving back vehicle batteries in larger volumes.Supply Chain 
Recycling97
While Tesla works with third -party recyclers, we also recycle in -house
In 2020, Tesla successfully installed the first phase of our cell recycling facility at Gigafactory Nevada for in -
house processing of both battery manufacturing scrap and end -of-life batteries. While Tesla has worked for 
years with third -party battery recyclers to ensure our batteries do not end up in a landfill, we understand the 
importance of also building recycling capacity in -house to supplement these relationships. On -site recycling 
brings us one step closer to closing the loop on materials generation, allowing for raw material transfer straight 
to our nickel and cobalt suppliers. The facility unlocks the cycle of innovation for battery recycling at scale, 
allowing Tesla to rapidly improve current designs through operational learnings and to perform process testing 
of R&D products. By the end of 2021, this facility achieved a production rate of over 50 tons of recycled material 
per week.
Every Tesla battery factory will recycle batteries on -site
As the manufacturer of our in- house cell program, we are best positioned to recycle our products efficiently to 
maximize key battery material recovery. With the implementation of in -house cell manufacturing at Gigafactory 
Berlin -Brandenburg and Gigafactory T exas, we expect substantial increases in manufacturing scrap globally. We 
intend to tailor recycling solutions to each location and thereby re -introduce valuable materials back into our 
manufacturing process. Our goal is to develop a safe recycling process with high recovery rates, low costs and 
low environmental impact. From an economic perspective, we expect to recognize significant savings over the 
long term as the costs associated with large -scale battery material recovery and recycling will be far lower than 
purchasing additional raw materials for cell manufacturing.Global annual amount of lithium -ion battery metals sent for

Tesla is committed to ensuring that our suppliers operate responsibly. We do this by proactively identifying and 
addressing potential risks in our supply chains. The Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and 
Responsible Materials Policy outline Tesla’s expectations for suppliers. 
We established a responsible sourcing program based on international best practices 
Our responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral 
Supply Chains. Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into on -
the-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report.
The next sections will detail how we undertake each of the five steps laid out above, starting with our management system approach.

Alignment with Best Practices99Prioritization of cobalt, lithium and nickel
Given their unique significance to the success of EVs and energy storage, Tesla has a dedicated responsible 
sourcing program for three priority minerals in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium. We prioritize 
these raw materials for the following reasons:
1.Commercial importance: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are the key raw materials used in cathode production, 
represent about a third of the total costs of a battery cell and play an essential function in improving vehicle 
range and safety performance.
2.Potential environmental and social impact and scrutiny: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also ‘minerals’ –in that 
they are raw materials that are produced through different methods of mining around the world, often 
concentrated in countries that face socio -economic and environmental challenges. As known global reserves 
are depleted, these minerals are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look to access resources in 
more remote and challenging locations to meet global demand. Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also classified 
as critical minerals by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments because they are essential in enabling a transition away from fossil fuels to a low -carbon economy. As a result, the impact of 
mining activity on the environment and local communities lends itself to greater environmental and social 
scrutiny from civil society, policymakers and investors.
Mining has an important role to play in the transition to sustainable energy and we engage with suppliers to 
ensure mining is done in a responsible way. This is one of the reasons Tesla joined the Initiative for Responsible 
Mining Assurance (IRMA) and uses the IRMA Standard as well as other internationally recognized responsible 
mining standards in our due diligence.Battery Supply Chain
#1 The Tesla Approach
100The unique T esla approach: Going directly to the source
The implementation of an OECD -aligned approach for cobalt, nickel and lithium is underpinned by the following 
two pillars:
1.Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple processing 
steps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain 
are present at mine sites. Direct sourcing from mining companies allows Tesla to engage directly in local 
contexts instead of having to rely on multiple midstream companies that typically sit between EV makers 
and mining. It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and 
social data. In 2021, Tesla procured >95% of lithium hydroxide, >50% of cobalt and >30% of nickel for nickel-
containing (NCA and NCM) cells directly from nine mining and chemicals companies. All nine binding 
contracts include environmental and social requirements. As T esla’s battery supply chain continues to scale, 
Tesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to increase .
2.Direct local engagement: Building on direct supplier engagement, Tesla seeks to contribute to the 
continuous improvement of conditions in communities affected by operations in T esla’s supply chain, 
informed by engagement with local experts, community organizations and civil society.Battery Supply Chain

Nickel sourced directly101Our diversified cathode strategy
Tesla’s batteries today contain a variety of different cathode chemistries, including nickel- cobalt -aluminum 
(NCA) and nickel -cobalt -manganese (NCM) for higher energy applications and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for 
lower energy applications. Tesla will continue to advance a diversified cathode strategy for LFP, nickel- rich and 
manganese -rich cathodes to address various market segments for vehicle and energy storage products and 
provide future flexibility based on raw materials availability and pricing. To put this into context, lithium only 
accounts for roughly 1.5% of the full battery pack weight. Additionally, iron phosphate battery packs contain no 
cobalt or nickel. 
While the relative cathode compositions and our overall demand of various minerals and battery -grade 
chemicals will continue to evolve, Tesla and the global battery supply chain will require significant quantities of 
responsibly produced lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, phosphates and many other minerals for the 
foreseeable future. While we recognize the critical role battery recycling will play in supplying a portion of these 
materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, global cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to meet the growing demand in the short to medium term. The availability and affordability of these minerals and chemicals are key to advancing Tesla’s mission and accelerating the transition to sustainable 
energy. We will continue to collaborate with our suppliers and upstream producers in providing visibility to 
enable the scale up of key battery minerals.
For cells containing NCA and NCM cathodes, we continue to work toward batteries that contain higher levels of 
nickel in order to improve vehicle range while lowering overall battery costs, without compromising overall cell 
performance, such as battery safety and lifetime, that is currently enabled by cobalt. It is important to note that 
we expect our absolute cobalt demand to increase over the coming years because our vehicle and cell 
production growth rate is forecasted to outpace the overall rate of cobalt reduction on a per cell basis.Battery Supply Chain

#2 Risk IdentificationCollect and review environmental and social data to identify risks
In the past year, Tesla collected environmental and social data in its cobalt, lithium and nickel supply chains 
through the following main activities:
2.1 Audits
Audits are an important tool for Tesla to gather environmental and social data for cobalt, nickel and lithium. 
•In 2021, 83% of refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s supply chain, including 100% of refiners and mine sites from 
whom T esla sources directly, either underwent or committed to undergo independent external sustainability 
audits against one of the following sustainability and responsible mining standards: IRMA Standard, the 
Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), Towards Sustainable 
Mining (TSM) and/or the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Performance Expectations.
•In addition, Tesla conducted six audits in the battery supply chain tailored to Tesla’s specific environmental and social requirements, including the OECD guidance and environmental management systems. Tesla also has an audit program that goes beyond the battery supply chain – please see pages 112 - 115.
•Tesla also reviews suppliers’ ISO14001 (environmental management) and OHSAS 18001 (occupational health and safety) certification statuses.100%

In addition to the product -specific LCA described in the Environmental Impact section, Tesla also commissioned 
LCA service provider Minviro to identify hotspots with high global warming potential across eight specific 
processing routes from which we currently source cobalt, nickel and lithium. 
The hotspot analysis found that main drivers of GHG emissions depend on the different battery compositions, 
processing routes and countries of origin. Overall, key drivers are the cathode and anode supply chains. Within 
the cathode supply chain, the hotspots are nickel and lithium, and cobalt was only a minimal contributor. Within 
the cobalt, nickel and lithium supply chains, chemical processing (refining / smelting) was a larger driver than mining.

#2 Risk Identification2.3 GHG emissions hotspot identification
Tesla complemented the hotspot analysis with data collected during a pilot blockchain traceability project for 
nickel sourced from Tesla nickel supplier, BHP, that traced nickel from a mine site in Australia to Tesla and 
collected GHG emissions data for every step. The pilot project showed that mining and upstream processing 
had a higher CO 2e intensity than precursor, cathode and battery cell production.
Building on this hotspot analysis and pilot project, Tesla developed a data collection methodology aligned with 
the GHG Protocol –a globally recognized standard for measuring GHG emissions –and informed by the 
European Product Environmental Footprint methodology and the Product Environmental Footprint Category 
Rules (PEFCR) guidance for batteries —a set of rules developed by the European Union on calculating product -
specific environmental footprint. Instead of relying on estimates or aggregate data from third parties, Tesla’s 
ambition is to collect as much primary data from Tesla’s suppliers as possible to get the most accurate 
understanding of GHG emissions hotspots and therefore, how to reduce emissions.

Reports and grievances from NGOs and community organizations as well as media articles are other important 
sources for potential environmental and social risk information. Tesla reviews allegations in detail and conducts 
its own investigations, including through direct bilateral engagement with relevant suppliers and with the 
parties making the allegations, to assess the severity of the risk and possibilities for risk avoidance or corrective

A Tesla delegation including members of Tesla’s Responsible Sourcing Committee visited suppliers in the DRC 
and Argentina. Both trips included visits to mine sites and meetings with community representatives. In the 
DRC, Tesla also visited a school, an orphanage and a maternity clinic. Aside from contributing to Tesla’s 
environmental and social risk assessments, the trips helped Tesla better understand local contexts and 
challenges. The DRC trip provided a more nuanced view of the complex issue of artisanal and small- scale 
mining (ASM) and its history within the DRC. In Argentina, the trip focused on questions related to water usage 
and the use of new technologies to extract lithium in a more energy -efficient way.
From all the activities listed in this section, Tesla identified six risk areas as well as cross- cutting topics in cobalt, 
lithium and nickel supply chains for prioritized engagement, described in Step 3, on the next page.

#3 Risk Mitigation and Positive ImpactTesla’s engagement in the DRC and the Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA)
The DRC is an important source of cobalt for Tesla batteries. We will continue supporting sourcing from the 
DRC provided our responsible sourcing standards are met. While Tesla does not source cobalt from Artisanal 
and Small -Scale Mining (ASM), we recognize the importance of ASM for local livelihoods. This is why Tesla 
provides funding to, and sits on, the Steering Committee of the Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA), a multi- stakeholder 
initiative to support the improvement of conditions in communities impacted by artisanal mining through the following activities:
•Occupational health and safety awareness raising campaign for mine workers
•First aid training for mine workers and selection of safety captains
•Distribution of protective equipment to washer women
•Creation of savings groups for mining community members paired with financial literacy training
•Development of referral system for children engaged in mining activities, including child labor notification 
protocol, remediation solution packages, and guidelines for case managers on remediation steps, in 
collaboration with the NGO, Save the Children
•Trainings related to child rights
•Electrification of five schools covering students through the distribution of solar -chargeable portable lamps
•A marketplace and football field selected for the placement of lighting poles

#4 Collaboration with Industry InitiativesCollaboration with industry initiatives
T esla understands that many of the environmental and social issues in global EV supply chains do not concern 
Tesla, alone. Tesla is actively engaging in multi- stakeholder forums and industry groups to find industry -wide 
solutions to industry -wide questions:
•Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA): Tesla joined IRMA as a Member in 2021 to support 
responsible mining practices and transparent and robust audit processes that emphasize community 
interviews. It is important to Tesla that NGOs and communities actively participate in third -party audits of 
mines against the IRMA Standard, as their perspectives provide greater context on mining operations and the 
impacts of extraction, while also increasing accountability and identifying opportunities for improvement.
•Global Battery Alliance (GBA): T esla has been involved in the GBA since 2020 and has served on the GBA 
Board and Battery Passport Steering Committee since 2021. Tesla’s goal as part of the GBA is to advocate for high standards for responsible battery materials sourcing, align with EU regulatory requirements, and 
support the development of actionable guidance related to GHG emissions data collection, recycling, and in-
country environmental and social projects.
•Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI): Tesla is a member of the RMI to support the RMI’s refiner audit programs and industry -wide responsible sourcing dialogue.
•IFC Net Zero Roadmap Working Group: Tesla has participated in the IFC Working Group since early 2022 to 
provide a downstream perspective in the development of actionable guidance for mine sites to reduce 
carbon emissions.
•Re|Source : Tesla participates in the supply chain -wide Re|Source consortium to pilot blockchain -supported 
traceability in the cobalt supply chain. Tesla offers insights from an OEM perspective on metrics critical to traceability efforts and works with the consortium towards the first end -to-end blockchain- enabled tracing of 
cobalt material starting from Tesla’s supplier in the DRC to Gigafactory Shanghai.
•Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA): Please see the previous page.
111Battery Supply Chain
OutlookOutlook for battery supply chain responsible sourcing: Formalization and expansion
Tesla’s battery responsible sourcing program is still relatively new. Yet, the program has achieved several 
important milestones this last year, including the development and initial implementation of a system to identify 
environmental and social risks in the battery supply chain and concrete progress towards mitigation and 
improving the situation of stakeholders impacted by Tesla’s battery supply chain.
In 2022, T esla plans to continue building on momentum of the program and improve on the data points shared 
in this report, including the development of supply chain GHG emissions reduction plans and further projects 
and investments in mining countries to have a positive environmental and social impact. Tesla will then explore 
an expansion to manganese, graphite, copper and mica. 
112Tesla’s Supplier Audit program
In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance 
evaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Tesla’s business. This program extension 
was introduced at the time when T esla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company 
gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production. We recognized that this growth came with an 
increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement. During the program pilot phase, we 
focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially 
dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts.
We chose to utilize the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the 
basis for our audits. The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and 
stringent requirements for supplier completion. It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety, 
environmental, ethical and management system topics. Audits are conducted by independent third parties that 
are approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its implementation ensuring a globally and industry -wide standardized approach.
In any case where any priority non- conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures 
require that suppliers undergo a closure audit. These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit 
where the non -conformances were identified –allow suppliers to address all non -conformances in the earlier 
audits. Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to 
improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies.
As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once, 
representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. As part of these audits over 4,000 
supplier employee interviews were conducted.Responsible Sourcing
Supplier Audit Program113Continuing to expand our audit program
In 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit 
program. While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the 
updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally. When we started our audit 
program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai. We now have six factories across 
three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially. As our global footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base. Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was 
an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply 
chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base.
The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk 
assessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location. This 
criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be 
nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the 
potential to further mitigate risk. With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50% of our global spend with our direct supply base.
As part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive 
way. When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans 
to remedy any deficiencies or non -conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity. In 
cases of the highest priority non -conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that 
their corrective action plans have been fully implemented. In cases of less severe non -conformances, suppliers 
are still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that 
those plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines.
Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero T olerance Violations, which, for example, include any 
violations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers. In cases where such 
instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be 
developed immediately, together with the supplier. Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the 
supplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable time frame.Responsible Sourcing
Supplier Audit Expansion114
How we identify and prioritize risks in our supply chain
Our Supplier Audit program is an important part of our efforts to identify and address environmental and social 
risks within our supply chain. These audits allow for a snapshot of a supplier facility’s programs and procedures, 
but also sets a baseline for future evaluations. Additionally, Tesla utilizes other avenues to evaluate potential 
risks in our supply chain such as those detailed below.
We engaged with several third -party service providers allowing us to continually monitor our supply chain for 
emerging issues that may affect our suppliers. These include issues related to labor relations, human rights and 
environmental degradation. This monitoring allows our Global Supply Managers to be notified as soon as information about suppliers becomes public and act by engaging directly with the supplier to understand their 
plans for correcting the identified risk.
Tesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct when identifying risks within 
our supply chain. We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing 
practices within our supply chain that are contradictory to our policies. Our responsible sourcing policies require suppliers to provide requested information regarding potential violations of our policies. Furthermore, 
we continue to leverage our membership with the RBA to identify upcoming supply chain risks as well as 
understand industry best practices to address them. We are actively involved with the RMI as well as specific 
action groups within the organization. In addition, we have utilized many of the RBA tools, such as country risk 
analysis to understand inherent risks in our supply chain and RBA -Online to collect information on corporate 
and factory -specific supplier performance.Responsible Sourcing
Identifying Priorities115Across all audits, we found no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment of workers
The table below details findings of our audits across all suppliers regardless of severity and includes initial 
audits as well as closure audits. Through July 2021, our suppliers have addressed and remedied 100% of priority 
non-conformances, with the remaining open priority findings to be addressed in upcoming closure audits. Our 
initial focus on high -risk suppliers allowed us to cover more than 70% of this group in the first three years of the 
audit program and gave us an understanding of suppliers to prioritize in an expanded program. 
In all audits conducted at Tesla's request at supplier manufacturing facilities producing Tesla products, we found 
no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment.
In 2021, the five most common findings were related to ( % of total findings within each category )2:
1.Working Hours ( 20.4% ): no more than 60 hours work per week, overtime is voluntary, one day off per seven 
days
2.Emergency Preparedness ( 11.1%):  proper permitting, emergency risk assessment at 11.1% of total findings; 
3.Wages and Benefits ( 9.4% ): proper calculation of regular and overtime wages, timely payment of wages; 
4.Occupational Safety ( 7.5%): availability of PPE, proper permitting; and 
5.Freely Chosen Employment ( 5.5% ): contract provided in worker’s native language, no excessive penalty for 
leaving position Responsible Sourcing

that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its 
affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.11 -12
Our Approach to Corporate 
GovernanceOur unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance. And our mission requires a long -term 
focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders. Our corporate 
governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter -intuitive to some, 
but which have set up the Tesla to achieve long -term success.13
Board Committees (as of March 1, 
2022)The Board has four standing committees —the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating 
and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee —which are each further 
described in this section. 14 -15
Compensation PhilosophyOur compensation philosophy reflects our long -term mission and our startup origins. We emphasize structuring 
compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily in 
our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear and 
measurable milestones. 16

Lifecycle Analysis of Tesla Vehicles 
versus Average ICERegardless of where they are driven (U.S., Europe or China), a Model 3 and Model Y emit far fewer greenhouse gas emissions per mile than a comparable ICE. Moving the grid toward more renewables and making our 
operations and supply chain less GHG intensive will only make this dynamic more pronounced as time goes on.56 –67
GHG Emissions: Scope 1, 2, 3We have disclosed our full Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location -based) emissions this year. We have also disclosed the 
amount of CO2e emitted through the use of our vehicles (part of Scope 3). The global Supercharger n etwork and 
home charging in California were both 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite resources (for the Supercharger network only) and annual renewable matching. 68 –69
NOx, Particulates and Other PollutantsNew research shows that fossil fuels are alone responsible for more than 8 million premature deaths annually, or 
almost one out of every five deaths globally, double previous estimates. Zero tailpipe emissions is a commonly 
overlooked benefit of EVs.70
Tesla Semi's Impact on EmissionsTesla Semi is poised to make a large impact: in the U.S., combination trucks make up just 1.1% of the vehicle fleet 
but account for 17.9% of annual emissions.71
Waste Generated per Vehicle ManufacturedAs we continue to build new, more efficient factories our ability to limit packaging and reduce waste increases. Waste generated per vehicle in Shanghai production is 60% less than our manufacturing in the U.S. We continue 
to push for innovative approaches to reducing waste as we expand our global operations.72
Water Used per Vehicle ManufacturedWater use per vehicle produced by Tesla was again below the industry average in 2021. Our new factories such as 
Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg will set a new standard when it comes to low water use per vehicle.73 -74
Emissions CreditsIn 2021, Tesla delivered more than 2x as many EVs as our next closest competitor, helping drive $1.5bn in revenue 
from selling regulatory credits. This money is being used to accelerate our production capacity deployment in 
direct support of our mission.75120Summary –Product Impact

Product Affordability 
(Price Equivalency & 
Total Cost of Ownership)Model 3 is price competitively with ICE equivalents. But, when compared on a total cost of ownership basis, the 
Model 3 is much closer to a Toyota Camry on all -in cost per mile than to an ICE equivalent such as a BMW 3 
Series.77 -78
Product Usage & UsabilityOur data shows that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they 
are generally being used as a customer’s primary vehicle. The superior range of our vehicles and a robust global 
Supercharger Network makes this possible.79 -80
Vehicle SafetyAt Tesla, safety features are not optional. Our full suite of safety features comes standard with every vehicle. 
When we design vehicles, first and foremost, we want them to be safe. Our active safety features are powered by 
eight cameras, a neural -net computer and learnings from our fleet of over two million cars. 81 –84
Autopilot SafetyIn 2021, we recorded 0.22 crashes for every million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot technology 
(Autosteer and active safety features). For drivers who were not using Autopilot technology (no Autosteer and 
active safety features), we recorded 0.77 crashes for every million miles driven. By comparison, NHTSA’s most 
recent data shows that in the United States there are 1.81 automobile crashes for every million miles driven.85
Data Driven SafetyTesla strived to go beyond industry standard testing. We leverage data from our fleet of over two million cars to 
better understand accidents and build solutions around them. 86 -87
Passive Safety & Tesla Safety Awards Since 2019, Tesla vehicles earned 5 -star ratings from safety rating agencies across the U.S., Europe and Australia. 88 -89
Fire RiskFrom 2012 to 2021, there has been approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled. By 
comparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation 
show that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle fires for every billion miles travelled.90
Solar + Storage ProductsPairing energy storage with renewables is required to transition our grid to zero -emission sources. In 2021, in 
order to meet demand that is well in excess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new 
production facility capable of producing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year.91-92
Resilience of the GridElectric grid disturbances in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the last 15 years. Our solar and storage 
products not only deliver cost savings and energy independence, but they also harden the grid from adverse 
events in a cost -effective and environmentally friendly manner.93121Summary –Supply Chain

*OTA designation indicates how many recalls / units were able to be satisfied using over -the-air updates. When a recall is fixed with an OTA update it obviates the need for a visit by the customer to a Tesla Service Center.126In 2021, we conducted a comprehensive materiality analysis to better understand the key ESG topics that were 
most salient to our diverse group of stakeholders. To start, we identified over 40 issues in key areas that could 
directly or indirectly impact our business. The topics ranged from economic, environmental, social and 
governance issues. These issues were identified from four components: (1) a competitive landscape review, (2) 
interviews with investors and other key external stakeholders, (3) industry reports and documented research, 
such as the World Economic Forum’s 2021 Global Risks Report and (4) external ESG frameworks relevant to our 
industry and regulatory requirements across global capital markets.
Tesla’s Sustainability Council refined the list of 40 key issues into a survey containing 25 questions in an effort 
to help us prioritize these topics for operational management and disclosure in this year’s Impact Report. As part of the assessment, we surveyed our key stakeholders, asking them to rate the identified economic and ESG 
topics on a scale of 1 -5, based on their perceived importance and impact to Tesla’s business. A total of 2,168 
individuals from Tesla and approximately 40 external partners, including trade associations, universities, 
suppliers, environmental consultants, nonprofits and local administrators, responded to the survey. 35% of 
responses came from North America, 57% from China and 8% from Europe. Below are the top issues identified 
by our materiality analysis, in order of importance to survey responders.Appendix

Supply Chain Policies
Tesla Human Rights Policy
Tesla believes the ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future and believe all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to 
support our mission and share our respect for human rights. We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nat ion's Universal Declaration for Human Rights (“UDHR”). The UDHR 
focuses on dignity, respect, and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain –including with respect to our 
employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, and the communities in which we operate.
Health and Safety
Suppliers are responsible for ensuring that their employees and 
contractors are provided with a safe and healthy work 
environment.Respectful Workplace and Equal Opportunities
Tesla recognizes the value of different backgrounds and 
perspectives in our workforce, and fully promotes equal opportunity for all employees, both current and prospective. Just as we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, 
religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or 
identity, national origin, disability, medical condition, military and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or any other characteristic protected by law, regulation or ordinance, we require our suppliers to similarly respect the people in their 
workforces.Environmental Protection
We expect our suppliers to share our goal of recognizing 
environmental protection as a key principle of a sustainable 
future.
Child Labor and Young Workers
Tesla strictly follows local and national laws restricting the 
employment of underage workers. Regardless of local laws, no workers at a facility or location that provides materials used in 
Tesla products may be under the age of 15.Relationship with Communities
Tesla is dedicated to being a responsible member of the 
communities in which we live and operate. This goes beyond our ability to create jobs and contribute to local value creation. We expect suppliers to also take every effort to continuously improve the positive aspects and reduce any negative impact of 
their operations on the local community, including with respect 
to environmental, social, and other quality of life factors.Indigenous Rights
The mining industry on which Tesla relies to source many raw 
materials that go into our products has historically had an 
adverse impact on the rights of indigenous peoples and 
communities in the areas in which they operate. For all raw material extraction and processing used in Tesla products, we expect our mining industry suppliers to engage with legitimate representatives of indigenous communities and include the right 
to free and informed consent in their operations.The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page :128The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page :Appendix
Supply Chain Policies
Tesla Responsible Materials Policy
Suppliers are required to use reasonable efforts to ensure that 
their parts and products supplied to Tesla do not contribute to armed conflict, human rights abuses, or environmental degradation, regardless of sourcing location. For all materials 
used in Tesla products, Tesla requires its suppliers to establish 
policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems consistent with the 
OECD Due Diligence Guidance for 
Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict -Affected 
and High -Risk Areas or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises.Materials Explicitly Covered:•Cassiterite (tin);
•Columbite -tantalite (tantalum);
•Cobalt;
•Gold;
•Lithium;
•Mica;
•Nickel;
•Wolframite (tungsten);
•And any derivatives of the above.Tesla requires suppliers to document their efforts to monitor 
their supply chain for any red flags indicating the use of child or 
forced labor or contribution to conflict or human rights abuses as well as environmental impacts in the mining or processing of these materials throughout the value chain. Suppliers must implement due diligence programs for the value chains of these 
materials and are expected to use the RMI’s reporting template 
for the collection of information where such a template is available.
For all other materials, Tesla will continuously assess their sourcing for potential risks and red flags, and where any are iden tified 
will engage with those suppliers to address any issues and require cooperation with our efforts.Suppliers are required to provide information upon request on their sourcing, due diligence efforts and findings for all materials 
included in the responsible materials policy.129The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page :Appendix

for completing compulsory education in a country, or (iii) under the minimum legal age for employment in the country. Workers under the age of 18 (Young Workers) shall not 
perform work that is likely to jeopardize their health or safety, including night shifts and overtime. If child labor is iden tified, assistance and remediation according to the 
stricter of international standards or local standards shall be provided.
Working HoursWorking hours are not to exceed the maximum set by local law. Further, a workweek should not be more than 60 hours per week, including overtime, except in emergency or 
uncommon circumstances. All overtime must be voluntary. Workers shall be allowed at least one day off every seven days, defin ed as a rest period of at least 24 consecutive 
hours every seven days. Suppliers must keep employee working hour and pay records in accordance with local and national laws andprovide records to Tesla upon request.
Non-
Discrimination/Non -
HarassmentSuppliers should be committed to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. Companies shall not engage in di scrimination or harassment based on race, 
color, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, ethnicity or national origin, disability, pregnancy, religion, political affiliation, union membership, 
covered veteran status, protected genetic information or marital status in hiring and employment practices such as wages, pro motions, rewards, and access to training.
Health and SafetySuppliers recognize that in addition to minimizing the incidence of work -related injury and illness, a safe and healthy work env ironment enhances the quality of products and 
services, consistency of production and worker retention and morale. Suppliers also recognize that ongoing worker input and e ducation are essential to identifying and 
solving health and safety issues in the workplace
Occupational SafetyWorker potential for exposure to health and safety hazards (chemical, electrical and other energy sources, fire, vehicles, an d fall hazards, etc.) are to be identified and 
assessed, mitigated using the Hierarchy of Controls, which includes eliminating the hazard, substituting processes or materia ls,controlling through proper design, 
implementing engineering and administrative controls, preventative maintenance and safe work procedures (including lockout/ta gout), and providing ongoing occupational 
health and safety training.
Emergency 
PreparednessPotential emergency situations and events are to be identified and assessed, and their impact minimized by implementing emerg ency plans and response procedures 
including emergency reporting, employee notification and evacuation procedures, worker training, and drills. Emergency plans should also include appropriate fire detection 
and suppression equipment, clear and unobstructed egress, adequate exit facilities, contact information for emergency respond ers, and recovery plans.
Industrial HygieneWorker exposure to chemical, biological, and physical agents is to be identified, evaluated, and controlled according to the Hie rarchy of Controls. If any potential hazards 
were identified, suppliers shall look for opportunities to eliminate and/or reduce the potential hazards. When hazards cannot beadequately controlled by such means, 
workers are to be provided with and use appropriate, well maintained, personal protective equipment free of charge.
Health and Safety CommunicationSuppliers shall provide workers with appropriate workplace health and safety information and training in the language of the wor ker or in a language the worker can

Metric / Disclosure / Topic Source(s) Methodology / Definition
Vehicle use- phase emissions, which represent 80 -90% of total automotive emissions 
(included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of 
unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all. OEM sustainability reportsAnalysis of sustainability reports by auto OEMs shows unrealistic assumptions for both vehicle life and annual 
mileage. For those that disclose their methodology we have found that vehicle life is often estimated to be as low 
as 10 years and annual distance traveled by vehicles as low as 6,200 miles. This compares to an average life of 17 years in the U.S. (20 years in Europe) and 12,000 annual miles in the U.S. (and 7,450 in Europe). When taken 
together, even before considering the impacts of using real -world MPG instead of NEDC, WLTP or EPA ratings, this 
leads to a drastic under -reporting of Scope 3 emissions.
8.4 million metric tons of CO2e savings Tesla estimateTo estimate CO
2e savings, we first measured the amount of miles driven by our vehicles and kWh of electricity 
generated and stored by our solar panels and energy storage products at the state, province, and country level for 
2021. We then applied an emissions savings factor (in gCO2e/mi for miles driven and gCO2e/kWh for electricity 
generated), for each state, province, and country to estimate CO2e avoided. For miles driven, the emissions savings 
factor is the net of estimated emissions from our vehicles and an ICE with a real -world fuel efficiency rating of ~24 
mpg. The emissions savings factor is based on grid emissions intensity in each respective location and includes upstream emissions from the production and transport of fuels. 
Tesla Cumulative Net Energy Impact: 2012 –2021 (TWh) TeslaFigures based on actual electricity consumption from utility bills for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. 2020 and 2021 figures also include measured consumption for on- site fuel use including propane, diesel and gasoline. Figures for 
2012 -2017 for electricity, and 2012 -2019 for on -site fuel use, are estimated based on actuals scaled for vehicle and 
battery production for each respective year and facility.

6,500 miles
At the moment, the manufacturing process of a Model 3 results in slightly higher 
GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion engine vehicle. However, based on the global weighted average grid mix, a Model 3 has lower lifetime emissions than an 
equivalent ICE after driving 6,500 miles. Tesla estimateEstimate is based on the difference in CO2e emissions from the average of manufacturing phase of a Model 3 and Model Y and an equivalent ICE which is then divided by the net CO2e savings per mile from a Model 3 and Model Y 
versus an equivalent ICE. Net CO2e savings are based on delivery -weighted global grid mix.

Manufacturing Phase Emissions for Average Mid -Size Premium ICE Tesla, Sphera SolutionsIn order to estimate the cradle -to-gate carbon footprints (GWP100) of select benchmark vehicles, a simplified 
approach of multiplying their curb weights by a carbon intensity of ~5.5 kg CO2e/kg was chosen. This reference 
value is based on a currently produced mid -size premium sedan that is comparable to the Model 3. The accuracy of 
this estimate for the other ICE vehicles directly depends on how their material compositions compared to that of 
the reference vehicle as well as on the existing variability of environmental impact profiles across different 
geographies and suppliers.
As such, the specific carbon footprint (GWP100/kg) of the reference vehicle is only a proxy for the average 
premium mid -size ICE vehicle. Based on past work on automotive LCAs (Rohde- Brandenburger & Koffler, 2019) 
(Koffler C. 873 , 2013) (Koffler C. , 2010) (Koffler C. , Krinke , Schebek , & Buchgeister , 2008) (Koffler C. , 2007), the 
uncertainty of these estimates is estimated to be less than ±20% for a cradle -to-gate system boundary, and 
therefore less than ±5% once the use -phase is added.
The reference manufacturer’s Environmental Certificates are calculated using the same BOM import functionality of 
the GaBi DfX software used for the Model 3 in the LCA authored by Sphera as well as GaBi 878 databases for all 
background data.
Benchmark mid -size premium ICE vehicles include BMW 330i 2.0, Audi A4 2.0, Mercedes -Benz C300 2.0, Alfa 
Romeo Giulia 2.0, Volvo S60 2.0, Cadillac ATS 2.0, Lexus IS 300 2.0 and Infiniti Q50 2.0.

BMW 330i, Cadillac ATS, Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS 300, Mercedes -Benz C300, and Volvo S60. use -phase GWP100 of 
~400 gCO2e/mi includes gasoline production and distribution emissions from GaBi 2019 databases as well as 
consideration of bio -fuel mix of gasoline in the U.S. (~12%).

Where solar and storage are assumed to be a fuel source for the use- phase of the Model 3Y, emissions were 
included in the manufacturing phase figure. The Model 3Y Rideshare Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 100% of these emissions on a per mile basis, while the Model 3Y Personal Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 82% of these emissions and 18% grid -charged emissions on a per mile basis (based on observed supercharging vs. other

Use-phase emissions calculated using the geographic distribution of the Model 3 and Model Y in each respective 
region based on Tesla's delivery data, which weights state, province and country level carbon intensity figures and assumes no change in grid mix into the future. This is a conservative assumption based on recent new electricity 
generation capacity trends and commitments made by states and countries to increase renewable mix on their respective grids. Grid emission intensities include upstream emissions from the production and transport of fuels.
Real-world observed efficiency of Model 3 and Model Y over ~30 billion miles, inclusive of energy losses from grid 
to battery, utilized for use -phase emissions calculations (converting gCO

Vehicle useful lifeU.S. Department of Transportation, European 
Automobile Manufacturers Association, 
International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, Association Auxiliaire De 
L'Automobile To calculate scrappage age of vehicles in a region, sum up annual vehicle sales from the most current year going 
back until the sum equals the current vehicle parc size. In order to be conservative, and normalize our figure based on recent vehicle sales trends in each region, we divided total vehicle parc by average vehicles sales in the respective regions for 2019 and 2020 (latest available data). This resulted in a scrappage age of 17 years and 
200,000 miles in the U.S. and 20 years and 150,000 miles for Europe. For simplicity, China assumed to have similar 
useful life to Europe of approximately 20 years and 150,000 miles.

With respect to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions metrics for the year ended 
December 31, 2021 presented in table 2 below, which are also included in this Tesla Impact 
Report 2021 as identified by the “*” symbol, management of Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) asserts that 
the GHG emissions metrics are presented in accordance with the assessment criteria set 
forth below. 
Management is responsible for the selection of the criteria, which management believes 
provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the GHG emissions metrics, 
and for the completeness, accuracy, and validity of the GHG emissions metrics. Tesla’s 
GHG emissions are rounded to the nearest thousand. 
Organizational Boundary
Tesla uses the operational control approach to account for and report its Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 GHG emissions. This includes sites engaged in manufacturing; sales, service, and 
delivery; and other activities described below. Data for acquired sites are included once 
the site has been operating for at least a year at the beginning of the reporting period.Management Assertion 
Scope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions
GHG Emissions Disclosure
1.Tesla considers the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
Initiative’s A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, and GHG 
Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, An amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard 
(together the “GHG Protocol”) to guide the criteria to assess, calculate and report direct 
and indirect GHG emissions.
2.GHG emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty because of such things as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to 
calculate GHG emissions, and the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific 
knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship 
between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions. Environmental and energy use 
data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature 
and the methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management of different 
but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts 
or metrics being reported.Site Type Site Activities 
Manufacturing Manufacture Tesla products, including vehicles, superchargers, solar tiles, 
and energy storage products. Support manufacturing through the design 
and manufacture of equipment and tools used at manufacturing sites or by 
storing manufacturing materials, parts, or finished products.

3.Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions are inclusive of carbon dioxide (CO2), 
nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and industrial gases such as hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).  Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and nitrogen trifluoride 
(NF3) are not emitted by Tesla’s sites. These carbon dioxide equivalent emissions utilize 
Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 – 100 year) unless a different 
Assessment Report is already embedded in the emission factor source. Carbon dioxide 
equivalent emissions are calculated by multiplying actual or estimated energy and fuel 
usage by the relevant emission factor taking into account the equivalent GWP. All 
emission factors are updated annually where applicable. Management Assertion
Scope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions141GHG Emissions Disclosure (cont.)
4.Related to Scope 1 GHG emissions: 
•Stationary combustion (natural gas): 
•Combustion from stationary equipment and machinery at all Tesla sites. 
•Global natural gas usage data was collected from monthly utility invoices obtained 
from third -party providers. 
•If monthly usage data was not available, Tesla estimated the natural gas usage by 
determining an annual natural gas usage rate per square foot based on actual 2021 
monthly natural gas usage data for sites in a similar geographic location and type 
of site. This rate was then multiplied by the square footage of the site building 
space.
•Emission factors: United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022.
•Stationary and mobile combustion (propane, diesel, and gasoline): 
•Combustion from emergency and portable generators, powered industrial vehicles 
(e.g., forklifts), temporary space heaters, and other portable equipment (e.g., 
landscaping equipment) at manufacturing sites. 
•Propane, diesel, and gasoline usage data was collected from invoices and fuel 
reports obtained from third -party providers.  
•Emission factors: U.S. EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022.
•Fleet mobile combustion (diesel and gasoline): 
•Combustion from the operation of Tesla’s on -road and non- road vehicles (i.e., 
Tesla’s global fleet).
•Diesel and gasoline usage (volume) from Tesla’s global fleet was collected from fuel cards issued by Tesla’s fleet management partner. Vehicle miles driven by Tesla 
on-road vehicles was collected from odometer readings and driver logs. Management Assertion
Scope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions
•Tesla classified vehicles in its global fleet by type: diesel medium and heavy -duty vehicles, 
diesel light -duty trucks, gasoline passenger cars, gasoline light -duty trucks, gasoline heavy -
duty vehicles, and non- road industrial/commercial equipment. Temporary fleet additions for 
operational use were categorized as ‘other’, for which only CO2emissions are calculated, 
because Tesla does not have detailed information on what type of vehicles were rented and 
miles driven.
•CO2emissions were calculated by multiplying the relevant emission factor by the volume of 
diesel and gasoline used by Tesla’s on -road and non- road vehicles for the year ended 
December 31, 2021. 
•CH4and N2O emissions were calculated by multiplying the relevant emission factor 
(depending on vehicle type and age) by the miles driven by Tesla’s on -road vehicles, and by 
the volume of diesel and gasoline used by Tesla’s non -road vehicles, for the year ended 
December 31, 2021. 
•Emission factors: U.S. EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022. 
•Process emissions (Gigafactory Nevada lithium -ion battery cell recycling plant): 
•Emissions from processing manufacturing scrap lithium -ion cells at the Gigafactory Nevada 
cell recycling plant.  
•The quantity of manufacturing scrap processed was collected from Tesla’s cell recycling plant 
operations team. The concentration of CO2and CH4in emissions (emission rates) were 
measured during two emissions source tests. GHG emissions were calculated by multiplying 
the quantity of manufacturing scrap processed, as recorded by the recycling plant operations 
team, by the CO2and CH4emission rates developed based on emissions source tests. 
•Estimated emissions from the sources above account for approximately 10% of Scope 1 GHG 
emissions.
•Excluded Scope 1 GHG emissions: Tesla excluded the following sources of GHG emissions which 
are estimated to represent less than 5 percent of Tesla’s reported Scope 1 GHG emissions:
•GHG emissions resulting from propane, diesel, and gasoline combustion at Tesla sites not engaged in manufacturing.
•GHG emissions from refrigerant loss to the atmosphere.
•GHG emissions from emergency stabilization of damaged and potentially damaged lithium -
ion cells.
•GHG emissions resulting from the chemical reaction of two -part polyurethane adhesives142GHG Emissions Disclosure (cont.)
5.Related to Scope 2 GHG emissions (location -based):
•GHG emissions from the generation of electricity purchased by Tesla for site operations. 
For sites that include Superchargers (electric vehicle fast charging stations), Tesla did 
not include electricity procured for customer use through the Supercharger stations as 
those emissions are included in Scope 3, Category 11 Use of Sold Products.
•Global electricity usage data was collected from monthly utility invoices obtained from 
third -party providers.  
•The WRI and WBSCD issued additional guidance for Scope 2 emissions in 2015 (in GHG 
Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, An amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard), 
which sets forth reporting under both location- based and market -based 
methodologies, where the prior version of the GHG Protocol only addressed a location -
based methodology. The location -based method applies average emission factors that 
correspond to the grid where the consumption occurs, whereas the market -based 
method applies emission factors that correspond to energy purchased through 
contractual instruments. Where contractual instruments were not purchased, the 
market -based emission factors represent either the residual mix, where available, or the 
location grid -average factors. This management assertion only includes Tesla’s location -
based Scope 2 GHG emissions as Tesla is continuing to implement its processes to measure and report its market -based Scope 2 GHG emissions.
