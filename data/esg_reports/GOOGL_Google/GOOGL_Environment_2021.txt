About this report
Google’s 2021 Environmental Report provides an update on the more 
detailed information about our sustainability strategy that we shared in our 
2020 Environmental Report . Our 2021 report covers our 2020 fiscal year 
(January 1 to December 31, 2020) and includes data, performance highlights, 
and progress against our targets. It also mentions notable targets set in 2021.
This report outlines how we’re driving positive environmental impact 
throughout our business in five key ways: designing efficient data centers, 
advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building 
better devices and services, and empowering users with technology.

Google Environmental Report 2021Our approach
We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect 
our planet. Sustainability is one of our core values at Google, and we strive  
to build sustainability into everything we do.
We’ve been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Google’s 
founding over 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements over 
the past two decades:
2007:	We	became	the	 first	major	company	to	be	carbon	neutral	 for	our	operations.
2017:	We	became	the	 first	major	company	to	match	100%	of	our	annual	electricity 	
use	with	renewable	energy,			 which	we’ve	achieved	 for	four	consecutive	years .
2020:	We	issued	$5.75	billion	in	 sustainability	bonds —the	largest	sustainability 	 
or	green	bond	issuance	by	any	company	in	history.
2020:	We	compensated	 for	our	legacy	carbon	 footprint,	making	 Google	the	 first	
major	company	to	be	carbon	neutral	 for	its	entire	operating	history.
Our five-year sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: 
accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, 
empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and  
places where we operate (see Figure 1).

Google Environmental Report 2021To accelerate the transition to a carbon-free economy, in 2020, we 
launched our third decade of climate action , and we’re now working toward  
a new set of ambitious commitments. By 2030, we aim to:
Achieve	 net-zero	emissions 	across	all	of	our	operations	and	value	chain
Become	the	 first	major	company	to	run	on	 carbon-free	energy 	24	hours	a	day, 	
seven	days	a	week,	365	days	a	year
Enable	5	gigawatts	of	new	carbon-free	energy	through	investments	in	our	key 	
manufacturing	regions
Help	more	than	500	cities	and	local	governments	reduce	an	aggregate	of 	 
1	gigaton	of	carbon	emissions	annually
To accelerate the transition to a circular economy, we’re working to 
maximize the reuse of finite resources  across our operations, products,  
and supply chains and to enable others to do the same. We’re also working 
to empower everyone with technology by committing to help 1 billion people 
make more sustainable choices  by 2022 through our core products.
To benefit the people and places where we operate, we’ve set goals to 
replenish more water than we consume  by 2030 and to support water security 
in communities where we operate. We’ll focus on three areas: enhancing our 
stewardship of water resources across Google office campuses and data 
centers; replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and 
ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools 
that help everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress.
At Google, we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability , and we’ll 
continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our 
planet. We’re proud of what we’ve achieved so far, and we’re energized to help 
move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.

Google Environmental Report 2021Appendix 
Endnotes
1. According to Google’s own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages.
2. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of non-computing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to 
power IT equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means 
nearly all the energy is used for computing.
3. According to the Uptime Institute’s 2020 Data Center Survey , the global average PUE of respondents’ largest data centers was around 1.59.
4. Carbon credits are reductions in GHG emissions made to compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere. For each metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, one carbon credit 
is created. References to “carbon offsets” (as mentioned in prior reports) have been updated to “carbon credits” in Google’s 2021 Environmental Report.
5. We procure high-quality carbon credits to compensate for the carbon emissions from all Google-owned shipments of consumer hardware, including to and from retail partners, 
distributors, and Google Store customers. Because shipping devices to customers falls outside the scope of Google’s operations, these efforts go beyond Google’s long-standing 
commitment to operational carbon neutrality.
6. Made by Google products are designed with 9%–68% recycled content across their respective plastic parts. This does not include plastics in printed circuit boards, labels, cables, 
connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge components, electromagnetic interference components, films, coatings, and adhesives.
7. Back housing only. Recycled aluminum is approximately 58% of enclosure based on weight.
8. Energy Savings from the Nest Learning Thermostat: Energy Bill Analysis Results , Nest Labs, February 2015.
9. Independent studies showed that Nest saved people an average of 10% to 12% on heating and 15% on cooling. Using typical energy costs, we’ve estimated average savings of $131  
to $145 a year. That means the Nest Learning Thermostat can pay for itself in under two years. Individual savings are not guaranteed.
10. One petabyte is 1015 bytes, or 1 million gigabytes, of digital information. It’s equal to approximately 2.5 months of uninterrupted, uncompressed, high-definition (1920 x 1080 pixels) 
video data.
11. Google was the largest organization, in terms of electricity consumption, to achieve a 100% renewable energy match.
12. In this report, “Bay Area headquarters” refers to our operations in both Mountain View and Sunnyvale.
13. Renewable material consists of plastic made from bio-based material.
14. Minimum percentage of recycled or renewable plastic content calculated as a percentage of total plastic (by weight) in all products manufactured in 2025. The following may be 
excluded from the calculation of percentage: printed circuit boards, labels, cables, connectors, electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge 
components, electromagnetic interference components, films, coatings, and adhesives.
15. See note 6 above.
16. See note 6 above.
17. Ernst & Young LLP reviewed select quantitative performance indicators for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. See the related Independent Accountants’ Review Report .  
Another third party verified the following emissions in prior years: Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 2 (location-based), Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting),  
and biogenic. For more information, see our prior annual Environmental Reports .
18. Alphabet’s fiscal year is from January 1 to December 31.
19. GHG emissions are calculated according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) , developed by the World Resources 
Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). For more information on our methodology, including a breakdown of Scope 3 categories,  
see Alphabet’s 2021 CDP Climate Change Response .
20. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources we own or over which we have operational control, such as company vehicles or generators at Google’s offices and data centers. 
Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the production of electricity we purchase to run our operations and the production of space heating for our offices. The location-based 
category reflects the average carbon intensity of the electric grids where our operations are located and, thus, where our energy consumption occurs. The market-based category 
incorporates our procurement choices, i.e., our renewable energy purchases via contractual mechanisms like PPAs. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our 
value chain, such as business travel or our suppliers.
21. CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability  
of a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP.  
Carbon dioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.
22. Since 2010, we’ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall emissions. Until 2015, there was no guidance from the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity 
procured against electricity consumed (in megawatt-hours) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol released new Scope 2 
guidance for the accounting of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data. Our pre-2015 methodology differed from the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol’s in that we did not use residual mixes, which avoid double-counting of claimed renewable energy attributes.
23. See note 19 above.
24. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food served in our offices, hardware 
manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google’s hardware includes 
data center servers, networking equipment, and consumer hardware products. These extended categories have been reported annually from 2018 onward.
25. We’ve restated our 2018 Scope 3 (other) emissions due to changes in our calculation methodology and improvements in data quality, resulting in a corresponding restatement of our 
2018 Scope 3 (total) and 2018 Total (Scope 1, 2 [market-based], and 3 [total]) emissions.
26. In 2020, due to the global pandemic, we began to estimate and report on our emissions associated with teleworking (i.e., employees working remotely). We applied the estimation 
methodology outlined in EcoAct’s Homeworking Emissions Whitepaper  to our annual average workforce in 2020 to estimate the GHG emissions generated by employees working 
remotely from their homes. Teleworking emissions are reported as part of our Scope 3 emissions for employee commuting, per Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Technical Guidance for 
Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0). For a breakdown of our operational Scope 3 emissions by category, see our 2020 Independent Accountants’ Review Report .
27. In 2020, we began reporting teleworking emissions as part of our Scope 3 employee commuting emissions. Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting) emissions reported 
prior to 2019 do not include teleworking emissions.
28. See note 25 above.
13
Google Environmental Report 202129. See note 24 above. 
30. See note 25 above.
31. We calculate total operational emissions as the sum of Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based or market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting, including 
teleworking) emissions, which have been third-party assured by Ernst & Young LLP as shown in its 2020 Independent Accountants’ Review Report .
32. See note 27 above.
33. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. For more information, see our 2017 white paper,  
10 Years of Carbon Neutrality . In 2020, we extended our operational emissions boundary to include teleworking emissions. The operational emissions included in our carbon  
neutrality commitment now include Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting, including teleworking).
34. Emissions reduced by renewable energy PPAs are calculated by subtracting Scope 2 market-based method (MBM) GHG emissions from Scope 2 location-based method  
GHG emissions, thereby representing emissions reductions from renewable energy PPAs and MBM emission factors.
35. See note 33 above.
36. Carbon intensity metrics are based on gross global combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions.
37. In 2019, we updated our megawatt-hour carbon intensity metric to include all of our gross Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions divided by our total energy consumption, 
rather than limiting this intensity figure to our data centers.
38. Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable and  
non-renewable sources.
39. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations  
(i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) with the 
total volume of electricity consumed by our operations. This metric includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. 
Prior to 2016, we were not accounting for the renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity.
40. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Scope 2 Guidance  requires energy attribute certificates to be sourced from and applied to the same market in which the reporting entity’s electricity-
consuming operations are located. This guidance does not recognize existing renewable energy on the electric grids where an entity’s operations are located.
41. Our carbon-free energy (CFE) percentage measures the degree to which our electricity consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis. This is calculated using 
both CFE under contract by Google as well as CFE coming from the overall grid mix. For more information, see our 2021 white paper, 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy: Methodologies and Metrics .
42. We’ve revised total waste generated for 2019 due to a calculation error. This correction resulted in a decrease in total waste generated for 2019 from 51,617 metric tons to 48,216 metric tons.
43. Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery.
44. In 2020, pre-consumer food waste prevented in our cafés was tracked only from January to March due to limited café operations during the global pandemic.
45. In 2019, we aligned our water reporting with industry standards to disclose three water indicators: total water withdrawal, as well as consumption and discharge.
46. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, water withdrawal was reported as water consumption. Beginning in 2019, we restated the 2016, 2017, and 2018 values as water withdrawal.
47. 2019 was the first year we disclosed gross global water consumption and gross global water discharge data; data for these indicators is not available for prior years.
48. See note 47 above.
49. 2018 is the first year that reflects a refinement in Green Business Certification Inc.’s methodology for determining LEED-certified office space.
50. This figure indicates the number of ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada, which represent the majority of our EV charging ports in those countries. We began 
installing EV charging ports in Canada in 2017.
51. Emissions avoided are estimated using data from the reported ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and Canada only.
52. While Google’s total number of installed EV charging ports in the United States and Canada increased in 2020, the ports experienced limited use from March to December due to the 
global pandemic, resulting in a decrease in emissions avoided due to employee EV commuting.
53. In 2020, due to the global pandemic, our Google shuttle buses in the Bay Area were in operation only from January to March.
54. See note 53 above.
55. See note 53 above.
56. All ecology projects that were scheduled for completion in 2020 were delayed due to the global pandemic.
57. See note 56 above.
58. In addition to our renewable energy contracts, Google also invests in renewable energy projects around the world that are not used to mitigate our emissions.
59. This indicator represents the expected combined capacity of contracted renewable energy projects in which we have an equity investment, even if we’re a minority owner.
