2021 Performance Report
Advancing Science 
for LifePatient spotlight: Arnold Vargas Gonzalez
Not long after joining Boston Scientific, Arnold Vargas Gonzalez sensed it would be 
more than just a job. “The Boston Scientific quality culture inspired me right away,” 
says the 39-year-old, who is based in Coyol, Costa Rica.
Arnold worked hard to progress from product builder to quality inspector, and with encouragement and support 
from his leaders and colleagues, he pursued a degree in industrial engineering to advance his career in quality.
After earning a promotion to quality engineer, Arnold suffered gallbladder complications, which led to a critical 
surgery. When doctors showed him the stent they were using, he knew he would make a full recovery. “I saw the 
Boston Scientific logo and it gave me such peace of mind. I believed in the device because we built it.” Arnold was 
soon back on the quality front lines and to his studies.
In 2021, amid global uncertainty, Arnold and his team  
stood strong — along with 41,000 Boston Scientific 
colleagues around the world. Across the company, 
our people innovated to improve patient outcomes, 
stay connected with customers and deliver solutions 
wherever they were needed. 
The collective resolve of our global team accelerated 
our progress as a business and as a corporate citizen. 
We found new ways to support our communities, 
protect the environment we all share and make care 
more equitable.
Like Arnold, we believe — in the power of doing our part, 
always working for a better future and advancing science 
for life.
Arnold Vargas Gonzalez
engineer, 
Quality Assurance  
and Boston Scientific patient“ I knew my future would be here, 
making our products — always with  
the patient in mind.”
Arnold and his wife Eimy, who also works in manufacturing 
at our Coyol site, are inspired to make life better for patients 
every day.

A message from our  
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
We remain confident in our progress and committed to 
transforming care, investing in our people, accelerating 
possibilities, protecting the environment and creating value 
responsibly. Our 2021 performance report is one example 
of our efforts to be transparent and accountable to the 
public and our many stakeholders. We are committed 
to understanding and managing environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) opportunities and risks in our 
business practices.
Overall, performance across Boston Scientific businesses 
remains strong and our future is promising. We’ve 
accomplished a great deal as we learned to manage 
through the pandemic. In 2021, we invested more than  
$1 billion in research and development and launched 
90 new products to advance patient care. We strengthened 
our digital capabilities to enhance patient engagement 
to facilitate remote education and training for health care 
providers. Our teams conducted 145 global clinical trials and 
received approximately 1,250 market approvals that expand 
access to our technologies. Above all, we improved the lives 
of more than 30 million patients.At Boston Scientific, we have always been dedicated to advancing science for life. 
Now more than ever — at a time when we face continued challenges and uncertainty 
as a global community — we are hopeful and united by our mission and values to 
create a healthier, brighter future for one another and for our planet.

Addressing inequities in workplaces, communities  
and health care systems 
The inequities in our workplaces, communities and health care systems have been starkly 
revealed over the last few years — by the pandemic, polarizing political environments, 
racial and social injustice and economic uncertainty. We have committed to support 
diversity, address health inequities and combat systemic racism and injustice both within 
Boston Scientific and our communities. In 2021, we made progress toward our goals by 
taking the following actions:
• Deepened our diversity programs aimed at eliminating bias, racism and other forms of 
discrimination in our workplace as part of our 3Up by 2023 initiative, which is aimed at 
increasing representation of women and multicultural talent at the management level.
• Introduced a human capital scorecard as part of our 2021 annual bonus program to 
hold ourselves accountable for building a more diverse and inclusive workplace and 
achieving our environmental goals. 
• Expanded relationships with certified companies that share our dedication to 
improving customer and patient care, which included investing more than  
$865 million in small and diverse suppliers to help us meet our business objectives 
through external collaborations.
• Extended our advocacy across 28 national and local organizations as part of the second 
year of a $3.5 million multiyear strategy to combat inequity, systemic racism and 
injustice in the U.S. 
• Increased diversity in medical research and partnered with community health care 
providers to expand awareness of health disparities and address them through our 
Close the Gap health equity initiative.
• Contributed more than $75 million in corporate donations to fund medical research, 
fellowships, education and charitable organizations globally.Taking action for a healthier planet
By protecting the planet’s health, we protect human health. That’s why sustainable and inclusive 
business practices are central to our work to transform lives.
We are on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 in all manufacturing and key distribution 
sites. In 2021, we committed to setting new science-based targets and reaching net-zero carbon 
emissions across our entire value chain by 2050.
So far, we’ve cut our energy usage by investing in and increasing energy efficiency at all of 
our sites. This includes new construction that meets the highest climate standards. Nearly half 
of Boston Scientific real estate — more than 4 million global square feet — currently meets 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design (LEED) energy and environmental standards. We are also converting to renewable 
energy. In 2021, 73% of our electricity came from renewable sources (exceeding our interim 
goal of 50% by 2021) and we aim to source or generate 100% of our electricity from renewable 
sources by 2024.1,2 We are also pursuing efforts to better manage or reduce waste, conserve 
water and increase medical device recycling to minimize environmental impact of our products 
and packaging. To better protect our business and customers from climate-related disruption, 
our climate risk approach entails oversight, risk management and mitigation efforts throughout 
our business.
Creating a healthier, more equitable future
We have much work to do but we are making meaningful progress. The spirit and commitment 
of our global team has enabled us to succeed during uncertain times. We have a robust portfolio 
and pipeline, ambitious research and development, the highest quality standards and a deeply 
talented global team. Working together, we can continue to transform lives around the world 
through innovative medical solutions.

Our ESG strategy: 
Advancing science 
for life
We believe in the life-changing potential of science for 
health care providers, their patients and communities. 
Our focus on improving patient health comes with a 
responsibility to have a positive impact on the world we 
share. We are committed to understanding, managing 
and integrating environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) risks and opportunities into our business practices. 
Guided by these insights and our values, we are making 
measurable progress.
Our people in approximately 115 countries are the driving 
force behind our initiatives aimed at addressing the 
world’s most pressing challenges, including inequity, 
economic disparity, climate change and environmental 
protection. Subject matter experts from across the 
company serve on our global ESG council and champion 
our ESG priorities. The council’s efforts are directed by 
our ESG steering committee, composed of senior leaders 
and led by a member of our executive committee. 
These members help shape our enterprise strategy 
and provide regular updates to our board of directors 
and its Nominating and Governance Committee, 
which has responsibility to monitor developments and 
oversee the company’s practices and policies related 
to environmental and social issues, and other matters 
impacting our standing as a responsible corporate citizen. 
Within this framework, everyone in the organization has 
responsibility for and contributes to ESG progress.Stakeholder engagement for ESG progress
Our ESG strategy, priorities and practices are informed by conversations with diverse stakeholders inside and outside the 
company — locally, nationally and globally. In our collaborations and other business relationships, we work with organizations 
that share our commitment to better understand and improve environmental, social and economic progress.  Importance to stakeholdersOur ESG materiality matrix

ImportantAssessing our ESG priorities
We can better focus our efforts to reduce risk and drive 
positive impact when we fully understand the ESG topics 
most important to our stakeholders and our business. 
In 2021, we engaged with an independent third-party 
consulting firm to update our materiality1 assessment. 
The work to examine our priority topics involved in-depth 
interviews, peer benchmarking and guidance from 
internationally recognized sustainability frameworks and 
standards. After consulting with internal subject matter 
experts on the topics identified by the assessment, the 
Boston Scientific ESG Steering Committee, Executive 
Committee and Board of Directors reviewed the findings. 
Taking direction from our stakeholders
We worked with our outside experts to assess research and 
benchmarking results and distill more than 100 potential 
material topics to 31. Based on this process and input 
gathered from stakeholder outreach, we scored potential 
topics on two dimensions: importance to stakeholders 
and impact on the economy, environment and society.
Informed by our materiality assessment and our values, 
we prioritized 15 material topics that would have the 
greatest impact. Our teams will be working to further 
prioritize and integrate these findings into our ESG 
strategy. We will continue to regularly monitor and assess 
progress to ensure we remain focused on the issues of 
greatest importance to our stakeholders.
1  Throughout this report, we use the Global Reporting Initiative Standards 
definition of materiality in order to identify and prioritize ESG topics for 
the company. This standard is different from the definition and concept 
of materiality within the securities laws that we use to assess, among 
other things, required disclosure in Securities and Exchange Commission 
filings. ESG topics identified as “material” for purposes of this report may 
not be considered material to the Company as a whole, including for 
SEC reporting purposes.

Overview and 2021 highlights
Amid significant disruption and uncertainty in a prolonged pandemic, our teams challenged what was possible. 
We developed new capabilities and adapted to stay connected with customers who were frequently faced with treating 
patients in challenging settings. Our people upheld rigorous quality processes, delivered market-leading solutions 
around the world and collaborated with providers and communities to expand health care access. To increase the impact 
of our work, we enhanced our digital platforms that support our products and help keep us engaged with physicians 
and their patients.
Innovating to meet more patient needs
Our teams are always reaching for breakthrough solutions that will make a meaningful difference for patients and 
health care providers. Our products help physicians diagnose and treat complex cardiovascular, vascular, digestive, 
oncological, neurological, urological and pelvic health diseases and conditions. We work across the company and 
with trusted experts and providers to deepen our portfolio in these areas and continue to create value for patients, 
physicians and payers. Our innovations are the result of organic research, collaborations, tuck-in acquisitions, 
investments in emerging technologies and strategic partnerships. 
Research and development (R&D) 
to advance innovative care
We pursue scientific advances through a uniform, global 
approach that combines business, technical and quality 
processes. This allows us to monitor products over their 
life cycles, from concept and commercialization through 
next-generation designs. The data we gather and analyze 
help us develop solutions to address unmet customer and 
patient needs.  In 2021, we invested more than $1 billion in 
R&D and launched 90 new products to advance patient care. 
Thirty-five percent of total company revenue flowed from 
products released between 2019 and 2021, which we believe 
represents a strong pace of innovation.We have research and development sites in the United 
States, the European Union, Costa Rica, India and China. 
Some of the sites also serve as R&D Centers of Excellence 
where we identify successful practices and share them 
across the company to strengthen our overall R&D 
capability. One example of how these R&D Centers of 
Excellence teams work together to inspire continuous 
innovation is our growing line of drug-eluting devices. 
Since introducing drug-eluting coronary stents in the 
early 2000s, our teams have advanced the technology 
and developed new devices to address a broader 
range of conditions. We offer our customers both a 
drug-coated balloon and a drug-eluting stent, providing 
a comprehensive set of therapies to treat patients with 
peripheral artery disease in major markets.Randy Schiestl

Seeking new opportunities to 
deliver breakthrough solutions
Through our venture portfolio and strategic 
acquisitions, we invest in early-stage and 
commercial-stage companies to identify technologies 
that expand our ability to diagnose and treat complex 
diseases and conditions. In 2021, Boston Scientific 
announced five acquisitions that we anticipate 
will help us advance outcomes and strengthen 
our pipeline. Learn more about each acquisition 
on our website .
Partnering to accelerate  
scientific progress
Our teams work closely with external research 
organizations, academic institutions and practitioners 
to evaluate ideas, develop medical device designs and 
conduct feasibility studies. For instance, through our 
Motion Medical joint innovation accelerator with the 
Mayo Clinic, engineers from Boston Scientific work with 
physicians to develop prototypes and treatments for 
conditions that impede quality and longevity of life. Here are some highlights from our collaborations.

Global Health Economics 
and Market AccessAddressing health economics  
to improve market access
To increase patient access to needed medical therapies 
globally, our Health Economics and Market Access (HEMA) 
team studies the health economics associated with using 
our devices. HEMA economists use clinical outcomes and 
real-world data to demonstrate the economic value of our 
medical solutions and share that clinical and economic 
evidence to support payer and provider decision-making. 
The HEMA team worked closely with our Close the Gap 
initiative in 2021, using health disparity analytics to engage 
providers and advocate for clinical trial reimbursement policies 
that support more diverse representation. 
As a result of the HEMA team’s efforts in 2021, we made the 
following advances to improve patient access to treatment:
“ It’s all about access. If a health care 
provider believes their patient is going 
to benefit from a procedure, we want to 
make sure it is affordable and covered 
by the payer so the patient receives the 
care they need.”Access in the U.S.
Most insurance plans in the U.S. now cover approved use of 
the WATCHMAN FLX™ left atrial appendage closure device.
The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services granted 
new payment terms for single-use duodenoscopes, 
including the Boston Scientific EXALT™ Model D, increasing 
patient access to medical technology that substantially 
improves diagnosis and treatment. Providers now have 
access to a device for the 40% of Medicare patients who 
need treatment for problems in the liver, gallbladder, bile 
ducts and pancreas.
Access in South Africa
Nearly 3 million patients now have access to procedures 
utilizing the AXIOS™ Stent and Delivery System, which 
enables physicians to treat patients endoscopically 
instead of surgically.Access in Korea
In Korea, patients now have access to procedures 
involving the SpyGlass™ DS direct visualization 
system and TheraSphere™ therapy for hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC).
Global evidence generation
The HEMA team published eight peer-reviewed health 
economics manuscripts and 24 peer-reviewed abstracts 
to contribute to the global evidence base for payer and 
other purchasing decision-makers.
Pre-clinical science and clinical trials
Before Boston Scientific products proceed to human 
clinical trials, we use stringent pre-clinical standards to 
conduct extensive research into new devices. After clinical 
trials generate safety and efficacy data, we publicly report 
the outcomes. In 2021, we continued to strengthen and 
refine our operating procedures to ensure we met or 
exceeded all European Union Medical Device Regulation 
(EU MDR) requirements.

Everyone makes an impact
Our quality culture is reinforced through annual 
Everyone Makes an Impact (EMAI) virtual events 
where patients and caregivers share how Boston 
Scientific devices improved their lives.Ensuring quality, health and safety
Health care providers and their patients deserve transparency about the quality of our solutions. That is why a 
comprehensive quality infrastructure guides our work through the life cycle of each Boston Scientific product. Our 
global quality and safety teams diligently oversee the processes and systems for everything we do — from research, 
development and design to product building, supply chain operations and distribution. Our annual bonus plan includes 
a quality metrics modifier, which allows the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board to 
reduce annual bonus plan funding for failure to meet quality goals and to reinforce accountability across the company.
• The Boston Scientific Best4 strategy is the framework 
our teams follow to deliver industry-leading quality 
through a patient-centric culture, agile quality 
processes, a relentless focus on product performance 
and global regulatory compliance. 
• Our global quality system continuously integrates 
customer feedback and enables us to adapt to 
changing global regulatory requirements.  • Quality improvement projects are prioritized 
companywide to ensure that our products meet the 
highest performance and safety standards and achieve 
excellent patient outcomes. 
• Boston Scientific quality system training is mandatory 
for all employees and compliance is monitored through 
quality management oversight.
At EMAI 2021, Brooke Thomas discussed how receiving an 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) changed her life.
Boston Scientific Quality teams collaborated with 
Human Resources to reinforce our quality focus through 
companywide incentives. For example, we launched the 
Quality Catch recognition program for product builders 
at all manufacturing sites. Employees who raise system 
or process concerns that lead to quality improvements 
are recognized by supervisors and peers for contributions 
such as “Eagle Eye” and “Raise Your Hand” catches. To learn more, visit our newsroom.

quality across our global supply chain. All Boston Scientific manufacturing and distribution sites use a shared set of metrics 
to ensure the highest quality standards are met throughout the company’s operations and supply chain. Best4 Taking a comprehensive  
quality approach
Our Corrective and preventative action (CAPA) efforts 
in 2021 included investing in systems, training and 
processes focused on preventative action. We also made 
measurable progress identifying and reducing risks 
through a combination of corrective actions and process 
improvements. Our practice of conducting limited market 
releases for key products demonstrates how we are 
adapting our processes to further support the responsible 
development and expansion of new markets. For 
example, with the launch of the EXALT™ Model B device 
in the United States and Europe, this approach allowed us 
to closely monitor and evaluate device use and adjust for 
any additional training needs prior to the full launch.
The company increased post-market surveillance 
activities across our product portfolio and participated 
in more than 400 days of external quality system audits 
involving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, EU MDR 
bodies such as DEKRA, the British Standards Institute 
(BSI) and TÜV SÜD as well as several country-specific 
regulators. Since 2017, Boston Scientific has recorded a 
39% year-over-year complaint rate reduction. In the rare 
event that we do detect an issue, we act swiftly and with 
patient safety in mind.

The sixth Boston Scientific Connected Patient 
Challenge featured telehealth solutions to improve 
patient care and connectivity while also addressing 
the gap in treatment disparities. After receiving 
a record number of submissions, first place went 
to Kalia Health for KAL-PDx, a home-based early 
detection test for preeclampsia.
Improving access and outcomes  
through digital solutions   
For a health care solution to make a meaningful difference, it must reach the patients who need treatment. In 2021, 
we made significant investments in physician digital education and engagement. Approximately 20,000 providers 
accessed the Boston Scientific EDUCARE platform for on-demand learning modules, interactive training tools, clinical 
overviews and case studies. The platform includes medical education and training courses that support health care 
professionals in the delivery of patient care around the globe and is the primary access point to the company’s 
professional education for health care professionals. To address treatment inequities, inconsistent outcomes and 
COVID-19 safety concerns, we also introduced targeted technologies for improving patient care.Protecting product data  
and patient privacy
We continued to invest in heightened data security and 
privacy. Our data security experts took action to mitigate 
potential vulnerabilities, expand cybersecurity monitoring 
and strengthen mandatory employee training. For network-
connected Boston Scientific systems, we implemented 
advanced security testing to discover vulnerabilities and 
quickly address them, along with a robust security risk 
assessment process.
Safe, secure remote assistance
The MyLATITUDE™ app enables 
patients with Boston Scientific 
pacemakers and defibrillators 
to stay connected with their 
providers through LATITUDE™ 
in-home monitoring. In 2021, data 
from the ISO 27001 and 27018 
certified LATITUDE system helped 
providers safely and remotely 
monitor approximately 1 million 
patients with implanted devices, 
to quickly detect and treat certain 
heart conditions.SpaceOAR certification for 
physicians in Hong Kong
Our Asia Pacific digital team 
developed a compliant virtual 
certification program for 
physicians using our SpaceOAR™ 
Hydrogel. The pilot program 
for providers treating patients 
undergoing prostate cancer 
radiation therapy will serve as a 
prototype for virtual certification 
programs in other medical fields.Measuring chronic pain with 
artificial intelligence (AI)
As the opioid epidemic amplified 
the need for reliable pain 
measurement — especially in 
telehealth settings — we work 
with IBM Research on technology 
to objectively measure pain. 
Our collective team of scientists, 
engineers, device designers and 
clinicians are using a custom AI 
and cloud platform to discover 
new biomarkers that will help 
clinicians assess patients and offer 
personalized chronic pain care.For more on our work to safeguard patient data

Overview and 2021 highlights
Our people continued to address unmet clinical needs with innovative medical technology. Teams across Boston 
Scientific adapted to new ways of working to deliver on our commitments to providers and patients around the world. 
We prioritized a diverse and inclusive workplace where employees learn and grow, have access to resources to support 
their well-being and receive equitable rewards for their contributions.
Our diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace
At Boston Scientific, we know diverse insights lead to new and better answers. That’s why we work to create an 
inclusive, open and equitable culture for all employees no matter where they sit or what role they hold. Our people 
collaborate in ways that foster new approaches to tough problems, demonstrate our core values and reflect our 
commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I). The result is innovation that helps improve patient care.
To achieve DE&I that endures, our aspirations and progress must be transparent and measurable. Our 3Up by 2023  
goals aim to increase the representation of women and multicultural talent in our workforce through policies and 
practices that give everyone equitable opportunities for career growth.

Unconscious bias training is required for all Boston 
Scientific employees. We expanded initiatives to support 
equitable opportunities for growth, including diverse 
hiring practices and development programs for women 
and multicultural leaders. To equip employees with 
additional skills and tools to recognize and address 
systemic racism, bias and prejudice, we introduced 
Anti-Racism & Cultural History (ARCH) training in the 
United States. The ARCH curriculum advances workplace 
understanding of race, culture and identity through three 
learning paths customized for individual contributors, 
people leaders and senior leaders. The program is 
required for people leaders and recommended for 
individual contributors. ARCH training will be adapted 
and made available in all regions starting in 2023.“ I have been promoted eight times

Building capabilities with diverse talent
In 2021 we broadened existing development programs 
and introduced new initiatives to increase opportunities 
for women and multicultural talent, strengthen retention 
efforts and offer additional pathways to leadership. 
GROW. We expanded GROW — Give Real Opportunities 
for Valuable Work Experience — after talking with Black, 
Hispanic and Latinx employees who build our medical 
devices and are interested in furthering their careers 
in business roles at Boston Scientific. The program, 
initially conceived in Cork, Ireland, enlists people leaders 
to mentor participants through a series of classroom 
and hands-on training sessions. After piloting GROW in 
Maple Grove, Minnesota, we extended the opportunity 
to product builders based in Arden Hills, Minnesota 
and expect to expand the program to more sites in 2022.  Accelerated Diverse Talent (ADT). Boston Scientific 
launched the ADT program to support the development 
of women and multicultural talent with the potential 
for advancing to more senior leadership roles. Through 
coaching and mentoring, development assignments and 
executive sponsorships, the program is helping us build 
a robust and diverse leadership pipeline. Out of nearly 
80 employees who participated in ADT in 2021, more than 
half have moved to a different role or been promoted. 
Nearly 30% of those who were promoted moved up to 
vice president or director-level roles.Spanish-speaking manufacturing program. In Spencer, 
Indiana, we collaborated with our Hispanic Organization 
for Leadership and Achievement (HOLA) employee 
resource group to introduce an all- Spanish language 
manufacturing shift to recruit product builders regardless 
of their proficiency in English. The program grew to 
support multiple shifts and manufacturing areas, and 
helped mitigate pandemic-related unemployment and 
labor shortages in the area and the language obstacle 
faced by a growing Hispanic and Latinx community. 
The company offers Spanish-speaking employees 
the opportunity to learn English at no cost, and it also 
offers their English-speaking colleagues comparable 
opportunities to learn Spanish.
“ We decided to invest in this project to attract employees who are going to be with our company 
for many, many years,” said project manager Marco Lopez, who pitched the idea for a Spanish-
language work shift. Lopez worked for Boston Scientific in Costa Rica before transferring to our 
Indiana site in 2016.
In 2021, our Maple Grove, Minnesota site graduated its inaugural GROW class of participants. 
All seven graduates have since progressed in their careers.

Recruiting with purpose
Boston Scientific collaborates with leading organizations 
that advocate for the advancement of individuals from 
underrepresented groups. Since 2014, we have partnered 
with historically black college and university (HBCU) 
engineering schools to support scholarships, research and 
advisory board partnerships. We also sponsor initiatives 
for Black and HBCU students, such as events organized by 
Advancement of Minority Interest in Engineering (AMIE), 
Career Communications Group (CCG), National Action 
Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME) and the 
National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). In 2021, Boston 
Scientific was voted a “Top Supporter of HBCUs” by U.S. 
Black Engineer & Information Technology magazine for 
the second consecutive year.Elevating employee voices through 
employee resource groups (ERGs)
Our voluntary, company-sponsored ERGs are essential 
to our inclusive culture. While these groups are typically 
formed around a specific affinity such as gender, race, 
veteran status, sexual orientation or life stage, all 
employees are welcome and encouraged to join and 
participate in any ERG. Each ERG has an executive sponsor 
and creates opportunities for members to network, 
develop career skills and contribute to our communities. 
Our Global Council for Inclusion (GCI) supports their 
efforts and meets quarterly to discuss ERG progress. 
The GCI is co-chaired by our chief financial officer and 
executive vice president of Human Resources and also 
includes our chairman and CEO, the executive committee, 
DE&I team members and all nine global ERG leaders.

Attracting, developing and retaining talent
Boston Scientific is a company where everyone’s ideas, ambitions and careers matter. We want all employees to have 
work that means something to them, in roles where they have opportunities to learn and advance. This means ensuring 
that people at every level of the organization have access to continuous learning initiatives and tailored development 
programs. It also means providing advancement opportunities for women and multicultural talent. Our 2021 investments 
reinforced our objectives for talent planning, manager development and engagement and retention.
Hiring and developing talent  
to meet business needs
Our talent planning approach relies on diverse representation 
and cultivating capabilities to address business needs. We 
do this by developing internal talent and recruiting top talent 
globally. In 2021, remote work offered opportunities for us to 
recruit from new talent pools while preparing and promoting 
people within the business. We also innovated with recruiting 
approaches, including a Medical Sales College scholarship 
program for students with high potential for becoming part 
of a salesforce that mirrors the diversity of our customers and 
their patients. 
We tracked workforce analytics and implemented ways to 
develop more skills internally. In tandem with these efforts, 
leaders used digital dashboards to assess organizational 
trends and improve hiring, advancement and engagement 
practices. These insights helped us tailor our internal 
development efforts and refine our recruiting outreach. As a 
result, Boston Scientific had more than 8,300 new hires and 
filled 22% of our open positions with internal candidates.

Listening and learning
Our best ideas come from our people. We devote resources 
to support ongoing feedback between employees and 
managers and communications channels for employees  
to share their valued perspectives.
Employee engagement survey
We conducted a companywide engagement survey that 
provided valuable feedback from employees about their 
jobs, leadership, development opportunities and our work 
environment. Boston Scientific made tablets available at 
manufacturing facilities to increase employee access to 
the survey and encourage strong response rates. With 
more than 31,000 employees participating, we recorded 
scores of 80% or higher for the key indices to the right.
We used engagement survey results to develop a 
multi‐year action plan focused on career pathways for 
all employees, supporting our teams through change 
and equity and inclusion initiatives for women and 
multicultural talent. To make progress in 2021, we 
conducted focus groups and interviews with existing 
talent to help promote retention, expanded leadership 
training and retention resources, and provided tools for 
employees as they adjusted to new ways of working.
Spark Survey. Our Spark Survey solicits feedback about 
our people leaders from their direct reports. The brief 
digital format asks employees to rate their managers on 
leadership attributes and is available in 14 languages. 
The survey is an important developmental tool for people 
managers and assists us with identifying enterprise 
people leadership strengths and opportunities. In 2021, 
more than 21,000 employees were invited to evaluate 
approximately 5,000 leaders. We had a response rate 
of 74%, and 95% of people leaders, as well as their 
supervisors, received a feedback report.Career growth and development initiatives
Boston Scientific provides tools and training for 
continuous learning so every employee can envision 
greater possibilities no matter where they are in their 
careers. We offer more than 150 professional and 
technical courses, including on-the-job training, skills-
based education and programs for employees who have 
the potential to hold leadership positions. 
In 2021, we launched a global Learning Leaders Council 
composed of cross-functional leaders who helped define 
and accelerate our vision for creating an agile, continuous 
learning organization. They identified ways to further 
connect learning to our business strategy, embed it in the 
daily flow of work, and prioritize learning for leaders and 
their teams.

Investing in our people leaders 
The skills needed to be a successful people leader are 
constantly changing. We rolled out more resources to 
help managers develop as strategic leaders, create a work 
environment built on trust and help employees achieve 
their career goals. Our development work included 
these programs:
• Manager Pathways. This program focuses on building 
leadership skills among our people leaders, including 
how to be inclusive and coach with empathy. 
• People Leaders Experience (PLE). This one-year 
opportunity for new people leaders addresses 
core leadership skills such as hiring, coaching and 
providing feedback. 
• Advanced Manager Experience. This eight-month 
opportunity for succession-ready senior managers 
emphasizes capabilities such as business acumen, 
strategic thinking and inclusive leadership. 
• ExecOnline. These courses for leaders at or above 
the director level include content developed at 
top business schools and real-time projects that 
participants incorporate into their day-to-day jobs. Virtual learning and development  
for our hybrid workforce
We expanded our virtual learning offerings to include 
more topics and opportunities for all employees, 
including self-development courses, a coaching portal 
and self-directed mentoring programs. In addition, 
we designed and hosted our first virtual leadership 
conference, a three-day event for people leaders.
• Virtual Learning Site employee views totaled 9,700+, 
including 4,500+ unique new views.
• Virtual Leadership Summit 2021:  
3 days > 6,600 attendees > 50+ speakers

Talent review and succession planning
Succession planning at Boston Scientific is a key 
component of our business processes. Our Executive 
Committee annually conducts talent reviews to 
understand insights about our succession plans, identify 
areas of opportunity and ensure we are developing 
the necessary bench strength. The reviews result in a succession strategy for all executive and critical business 
roles. Succession plans for the CEO are reviewed annually 
by the company’s board of directors and its Nominating 
and Governance committee. Succession planning takes 
place for employees at every level when leaders gather 
annually to assess the performance of their teams and 
development plans. These review sessions help to ensure 
a strong pipeline of emerging leaders.
Throughout our talent review and succession planning 
processes, we continue to strengthen our commitment to 
advancing our diverse talent into leadership roles. In 2021 
we evolved the annual review to include highlights on key 
diverse talent. This provided visibility and a commitment 
to actions to accelerate development and readiness for 
next roles. Key talent actions are monitored throughout 
the year.

Employee well-being, rewards and safety
At Boston Scientific, we prioritize the well-being, health and safety of our employees and their families. We strive to 
be flexible about where and when employees perform their work and to offer benefits that are valued by our people, 
promote well-being and support life-work integration. 
Adapting to new ways of working
In the wake of the pandemic, the company reassessed its physical space and modified onsite protocols to support 
employees as they adopted new work modes. This involved workplace modifications to meet health and safety guidelines, 
conference room upgrades, new ordering systems for home office equipment, and training to help employees succeed in 
hybrid, onsite and remote settings. By the end of 202,1 as employees adapted to our culture of greater flexibility, 42% of our 
people worked onsite, 41% adopted hybrid work modes and 17% worked primarily from remote locations. Our return-to-site 
resources included employee toolkits, onsite amenities, leader resources and safe onsite workspaces for collaboration.Benefits that meet employee needs
Boston Scientific benefit programs support the well-being 
and health of our people while providing flexibility to meet 
their unique needs and expectations. Employee eligibility 
for benefits follows local regulations and practices. In 
most countries, this means we offer benefits to full-time 
employees and part-time employees working more than 
a certain number of hours. We typically provide benefit 
programs that are above and beyond government 
requirements and offer a portfolio of additional benefits 
that support our diverse population and the individual 
needs of our employees.
Embracing life-work needs 
Our Global Benefits to Fit Your Life program is designed 
to make life-work integration easier for all employees at 
any stage of life. It provides the flexibility and benefits and 
services our employees want to be happy, productive and 
engaged in their roles. In applicable countries, our life-work 
offerings include telehealth services, childcare and parental 
care benefits, college and financial planning, fertility and 
surrogacy benefits, a breast milk shipping service, domestic 
partner benefits, tuition support, a meal-planning service 
and sabbaticals for employees with more than seven years 
of service.

To learn more about our global benefit programs 
and services, visit BenefitsConnect.Our approach to compensation 
and pay equity
We believe strongly in rewarding people for their 
contributions to our high performance. Where it is 
relevant to an employee’s responsibilities and follows 
local and national labor standards, we strive to offer 
both a base and a variable component to employee pay. 
Variable components include annual bonus programs, 
long-term incentive stock awards and performance 
rewards issued on a one-time basis, on-the-spot bonuses 
for highly successful projects and recognition awards for 
breakthrough performance.In 2021, we acknowledged the extraordinary efforts and 
resiliency of our teams during the pandemic with a one-time 
employee appreciation award for all employees. In addition, 
we expanded eligibility for the Boston Scientific Annual 
Bonus Plan to include even more employees in 2022. 
Paying people equally for equal work is foundational 
to our inclusive culture. Our most recent assessment 
again reported 99% or greater pay equity for employees 
across gender globally and for multicultural talent in the 
United States and Puerto Rico. Our compensation experts 
regularly benchmark salaries and conduct companywide 
and external parity audits.  
 
We contract with an independent third party to assess pay 
equity for all positions using regression analysis. This  
data-driven approach controls for variables that appropriately influence compensation such as job position, 
tenure, years of experience and location. We use the 
results to identify any potential pay disparities and address 
them accordingly.

As ways of working changed for our people everywhere, 
we enhanced mental health and well-being resources 
to support employees in meeting their work and 
family commitments.
• Webinars. We offered more than 50 health and 
well-being webinars led by caregiving specialists and 
licensed clinicians. 
• Employee network. We created a resource-rich virtual 
community that facilitates information sharing on 
topics such as parenting and well-being.
• Virtual support. We expanded internal well-being 
circles to provide forums for employees to connect 
over shared circumstances and concerns.
• Global Employee Assistance Program (EAP). We 
increased education on how to use our global network 
of well-being and mental health resources. 
• Access to care. In the U.S., we increased telehealth 
mental health care options and waived all co-pays 
for mental health visits to ensure cost would not be a 
barrier to care.

Keeping our employees healthy and safe 
Boston Scientific takes a comprehensive approach to 
managing and monitoring employee health and safety 
at all offices and facilities globally. In the United States 
in 2021, our occupational health nurse program and 
standards of practice earned national recognition from 
the American Board for Occupational Health Nurses 
(ABOHN). Globally, we enhanced COVID-19 processes  
and protocols to keep employees safe. 
Employee safety initiatives we supported included:
• Maximizing opportunities for people to work from 
home to reduce potential for disease transmission.
• Providing advice and equipment for at-home testing.
• Issuing personal protective equipment free of charge. 
• Offering an occupational health support call service.
• Establishing a confidential employee vaccine register. We set health and safety goals called Total Recordable 
Incident Rate (TRIR) targets and have a 2030 goal of 
0.25 TRIR per 100 employees. Our global Employee 
Health and Safety (EHS) Operations Council reviews 
site TRIR performance monthly to discuss risks, trends 
and opportunities for improvement. We expanded the 
employee coverage in our TRIR calculation to incorporate 
98% of our employee population in 2021, up from 67% 
in 2020. As a result, our TRIR performance now reflects 
incident rates for all global supply chain teams as well as 
the majority of commercial staff who work primarily in 
remote and office settings.In accordance with the Boston Scientific Environment, 
Health and Safety Policy , we integrate health and 
safety metrics across our global monitoring systems. 
Our workplace guidelines support this policy and set 
specific expectations for health- and safety-related 
programs. We have met International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) requirements to achieve ISO 
45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System certification at four company locations. 
Our agile safety approach: 2021 
COVID response team in India
When a devastating COVID-19 surge struck India,  
we acted quickly to protect more than 550 employees 
and 140 contractors across the country. Our team 
of cross-functional experts organized testing and 
medical services, financial assistance and vaccination 
drives and secured life-saving supplies such as 
oxygen concentrators. With contingency processes 
in place, we prevented infection among employees, 
helped their families and avoided business disruption. 
Boston Scientific is a Great Place to Work-CertifiedTM 
organization in India and is recognized among India’s 
Great Mid-size Workplaces 2021.

Overview and  
2021 highlights
In 2021, Boston Scientific collaborated with providers 
and nonprofit and local community organizations 
to confront persistent health care inequities in 
underrepresented populations. Our teams worked to 
improve treatment access and increase diversity in 
medical research for women and individuals in Black, 
Hispanic and Latinx communities. We also invested in 
initiatives to support our communities, including science, 
technology, engineering and math (STEM) education in 
underserved communities.
Improving health 
equity and access
Social and economic factors — education, employment 
status, income level, zip code, gender and ethnicity — can 
have a significant impact on people’s ability to live long, 
healthy lives. Because health care inequities are rooted 
in a broad range of injustices, our approach to mitigate 
those inequities is far-reaching.
Ralph Redd, MD 
vascular surgeon,  
Montgomery, Alabama“ Close the Gap’s disparity data helped us identify health 
needs within our local community — as a result, we set up 
a rural health clinic to evaluate patients for coronary artery 
and peripheral artery disease. This program is closing the 
treatment gap and helping patients receive the medical 
interventions they need.”

Our Close the Gap initiative 
to combat health inequities
Close the Gap is our top initiative to address health care 
gaps in underserved communities in the United States. 
Over the course of 18 years, we have expanded its reach 
to identify and address systemic and emerging treatment 
gaps. Our vision is a world where all patients understand 
their medical conditions and have access to care.In 2021, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to expose 
and worsen severe care disparities, we took the following 
measures to advance equitable care: 
• Educating providers. We partnered with community 
providers to generate local disparity index data on 
disease prevalence and treatment inequities, identifying 
72,000 women and people of color who were not 
receiving equitable specialty care. 
• Educating patients. More than 10,000 patients 
visited KnowYourHealth.com for resources such as a 
personalized heart risk assessment and a find a doctor 
tool. Approximately 2,100 patients attended virtual 
health summits organized by Close the Gap in 2021. Close the Gap 2021:

Increasing diversity in medical research
Diversity in medical research is essential to ensuring 
everyone can benefit from treatments and therapies. 
We partner with providers and patient advocacy 
organizations to improve representation in clinical 
research. For example, approximately 200 million people 
globally are affected by peripheral artery disease (PAD), 
a common circulatory problem that disproportionately 
affects Black men and women. Yet, typically these groups 
are underrepresented in PAD clinical trials. To expand the 
body of clinical evidence on the outcomes of patients 
diagnosed with PAD — particularly women and people of 
color — we launched ELEGANCE, a global patient registry 
and post-market study whose goal is to enroll no less 
than 40% women and 40% underrepresented minorities. 
The registry is also groundbreaking for the diversity of its 
principal investigators, more than half of whom identify 
as women and/or people of color.
“ Increasing diversity in medical research is a critical step to ensure that 
everyone can benefit from treatments and therapies. Now is the time 
to eliminate disparities in health care — once and for all.”

Combating racism in the United States
In the second year of our $3.5 million multiyear strategy to 
combat racism, we expanded our advocacy across five pillars of 
investment that we identified in collaboration with 28 national 
and local organizations, such as The New Commonwealth 
Racial Equity and Social Justice Fund in Massachusetts, 
Advancing Minorities' Interest in Engineering and Nexus 
Community Partners. More than 100 employees volunteered 
alongside company leaders with these organizations to launch 
initiatives primarily supporting the Black community.

Government / policies
Sponsored a congressional Black Caucus 
Foundation fellowship. Confronting inequities
We have a responsibility to uphold our values in all that we 
do. In 2021, we continued to take decisive actions to confront 
racism and intolerance. In the face of pandemic-fueled hate 
crimes targeting the Asian community, we spoke out against 
xenophobia and stood in solidarity with our colleagues. 
We organized listening forums and offered resources to 
employees, including access to bystander intervention 
training and expanded leadership inclusion training. In 
March 2021, we joined a coalition of organizations and  
allies who share support for Stop AAPI Hate by hosting 
virtual events and reporting on hate incidents using Stop 
AAPI Hate data.
Our commitment to confronting discrimination and 
injustice compelled us to take additional action in 2021. 
Boston Scientific introduced Anti-Racism & Cultural 
History (ARCH) training for U.S. employees to advance 
our collective understanding of race, culture and identity 
and its impact in the workplace and beyond.CEO action for racial equity
Boston Scientific stepped up its commitment to  
CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion with support for the 
CEO Action for Racial Equity Fellowship , an initiative to 
advance policy change at the federal, state and local

to support relief efforts in the area. In 2021, the company 
coordinated and encouraged employee donations to help 
people affected by COVID-19, the earthquake in Haiti and 
wildfires in the United States and Europe. Employees who 
donated to these efforts received a matching contribution 
from the company.
Vaccine availability led to stabilized COVID-19 rates in 
some parts of the world, while other areas with less 
access faced devastating surges. Boston Scientific made 
additional financial contributions to assist with critical 
medical care, including vaccines and COVID-19 testing in 
India, Brazil and other countries where resources were 
needed. We also took the following steps to support our 
employees, their families and communities:
• Extended employee COVID-19 insurance support, 
financial assistance, vaccine reimbursement and 
telehealth services.
• Provided employees with supplies such as personal 
protective equipment, COVID-19 care kits and 
oxygen concentrators.
• Secured lodging for employees and family members 
with asymptomatic, mild or moderate COVID-19 so 
they could quarantine away from home.

Boston Scientific took action for a healthier world by 
further reducing our environmental impact, addressing 
supply chain sustainability and working to mitigate 
material climate risks to the business. We exceeded 
our target of 50% renewable electricity use by 2021, 
stayed on course for carbon neutrality in all of our

committed to setting science-based targets and reaching 
net-zero carbon emissions across our entire value chain 
by 2050. Our teams also made progress monitoring 
the business risks associated with climate change and 
advancing product stewardship and waste management. 
We recognize our responsibility to further respond to 
climate change, and are working towards implementing

Cutting energy use
To ensure we’re investing in energy efficiency at 
all sites and developing new construction that 
meets the highest climate standards, we adhere 
to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design (LEED) framework and the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) 50001:2018 
energy management standard.Minimizing our carbon footprint1
A central component of our approach to carbon neutrality 
is our C3 energy strategy:
Cutting 
energy use
through continual 
improvement 
in energy 
performance
Converting to 
renewable energy 
sources instead of relying 
on fossil fuelsCompensating 
with carbon 
credits and offset 
projects for remaining 
unavoidable emissions“ Across our operations, we 
use science and innovation to 
create a sustainable and flexible 
footprint that accommodates 
change, supports productivity 
and protects the environment.”
Paul Donhauser
vice president, Global Real Estate,  
Facilities Operations,  
Environment, Health and SafetyConverting to renewable energy
After investing in energy efficiency, converting 
to renewable energy is the next step in our C3 
strategy. We monitor the percentage of energy 
generated from renewable sources, whether 
produced onsite or purchased from outside 
suppliers. In 2021, we achieved 73% renewable 
electricity, which exceeded our interim objective 
of 50% for 2021 and keeps us on track to source or 
generate 100% of our electricity from renewable 
sources by 2024.1, 2 We are targeting, by 2027, 90% 
of all energy used at Boston Scientific facilities be 
from renewable sources.1
Compensating with carbon offsets
While our primary focus is cutting energy use 
and converting to clean energy sources, the third 
part of our C3 strategy is to offset unavoidable 
emissions for certified high quality carbon 
removals. We assess potential projects to ensure 
the results will balance our remaining emissions.

Transformation in Galway:  
carbon neutral clean room
At our Galway, Ireland manufacturing campus, 
Boston Scientific teams re-engineered a computer 
manufacturing facility that the company 
purchased in 2016 into a carbon-neutral clean 
room. The team converted the facility into an 
energy efficient space, powered by renewable 
electricity, with fresh air handling units, air-
source heat pumps and piped heat energy 
recovery. The facility, now certified ISO class 8, 
requires approximately one-third the energy of a 
conventional clean room of equivalent size.

Managing waste and water usage
We use the ISO 14001:2015 environmental management 
system to measure and reduce waste and water usage at 
key manufacturing and distribution facilities. As of 2021, 
we had 16 sites certified to this standard.
Managing non-hazardous waste
To make progress toward our goal of diverting all waste 
from landfills and incineration by 2030, Boston Scientific 
is participating in the Total Resource Use and Efficiency 
(TRUE) certification program at our manufacturing and major distribution centers. This approach to resource use 
and facility operations is helping us take the additional 
steps necessary to achieve our zero-waste objective.
Conserving water
While our operations are not water intensive, we are 
committed to minimizing usage and preparing for 
environmental challenges such as water scarcity. Water 
usage at our manufacturing and major distribution 
centers is predominantly associated with employees; 16% 
of consumption is associated with production processes. 2021 recycling and

Managing climate risk
Climate change presents risks to the world around us 
and our business. Natural disasters, extreme weather and 
other climate-related conditions could adversely affect 
our operations and supply chain, from the availability 
of materials to energy supply and transportation. As we 
invest in protecting our business and customers from 
climate-related disruption, we incorporate climate risk 
into our modeling, planning and financial disclosures. 
To help identify and monitor the impacts of climate 
change, we use risk management software to map our 
sites against climate risk indices such as wildfire hazard, 
drought hazard, heat stress and sea-level rise.
Our climate risk management approach
Oversight
The Boston Scientific Board of Directors 
oversees management of strategic, operational, 
financial, legal and compliance risks, including 
environmental and climate-related risks. Our 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program 
supports the board in these activities.
Risk assessment
The ERM team analyzes climate risks so we can 
manage potential challenges to meeting our 
business objectives. They follow our climate-
related controls and escalation procedures to 
report potential material impacts to the board.
Mitigation
To mitigate climate risks, the company deploys 
and diverts resources as needed to secure our 
supply chain and limit operational disruption.  
In response to severe weather events, we engage 
with potentially affected customers and external 
partners to maintain business continuity.
Measurement
Using the CDP platform, we completed a 
comprehensive assessment of the company’s 
climate-related initiatives and received an 
A- score. This result reflects strong progress 
toward our climate-related disclosures, including 
increased disclosures about our climate risks and 
environmental practices.

Advancing product stewardship
Good product stewardship requires a concerted effort to minimize the health, safety, environmental and social impacts 
of our company’s products. We take this seriously and are examining the environmental footprint of our devices — from 
design, sourcing, production and distribution to waste disposal or recycling. We have made measurable progress with 
initiatives focused on packaging, labeling and device recycling and are focused on further reducing environmental 
impacts of our technologies throughout the entire product life cycle.
Reducing our footprint with improved 
packaging and labeling
Boston Scientific packaging practices require the 
highest quality sterilization, distribution and storage 
of our medical devices. We develop packaging and 
labeling sustainability goals under the guidance of a 
global steering committee and use processes that meet 
international labeling regulations. 
Our practices optimize design, reduce waste and limit 
emissions from shipping. For example, we avoided more 
than 41 metric tons of paper waste in 2021 by hosting 
an eLabeling website where customers could download 
Instructions for Use (IFU) as needed in multiple languages. 
We continue to advocate for eLabeling expansion into the 
European Union through a MedTech Europe working group.Here are some examples of our 2021 packaging 
and labeling sustainability advances and other 
successful practices.
• Men’s health move to eLabeling. We streamlined 
product literature and used eLabeling to reduce 
annual paper use by 3.9 metric tons and plastic waste 
by 854 kg. Minimizing the paper and plastic needed 
for shipping enabled us to cut carbon emissions by 
16.8 metric tons.
• Sustainable packaging solutions. In our Quincy, 
Massachusetts and Kerkrade, the Netherlands 
distribution centers, we use integrated packaging 
machines for most of our orders. These machines 
better fit products into custom-sized boxes, reduce 
empty space and require fewer cartons per order. 
Since 2011, Boston Scientific has reduced packaging 
during shipping by 30% in Kerkrade. In Quincy, we have 
reduced packaging during shipping by 27% since 2020.
• Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council (HPRC). As a 
member of HPRC, we collaborate with industry peers 
to increase the recycling of plastics in clinical settings. 
For instance, we supported the HPRC’s work in 2021 to 
understand the guidelines for using advanced recycling 
technologies for medical recycling that break down 
plastic waste and require less sorting by facilities staff.2021 packaging

Collaborating to increase medical device recycling
In the United States, we partner with industry leaders in medical recycling and waste management to offer sustainability 
solutions for select single-use devices, such as systems for recycling entire devices and converting product waste to energy. 
For example, within participating customers, 65% of LithoVue™ systems and 39% of EXALT™ Model D systems were recycled 
in the United States in 2021. We will continue to explore additional options in the future.A partnership to reduce 
environmental impact
In 2021, we expanded our collaboration with the 
Liryc Electrophysiology and Heart Modeling Institute 
to focus on reducing the environmental impact of 
single-use electrophysiology (EP) catheters. Together 
we worked with a group of cross-functional experts 
to study catheter end-of-life practices such as 
recycling. We also supported a survey conducted by 
Liryc, in partnership with the European Heart Rhythm 
Association (EHRA), to identify physician practices and 
opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of 
EP catheters.

Keeping our products and patient data secure
Ensuring the safety and security of our products and the patients who rely on them is a top priority. Boston Scientific has 
global cybersecurity protocols that anticipate and address possible threats to product security and to patient information. 
The company’s Remote Patient Management System that allows health care providers to remotely monitor Boston 
Scientific implantable cardiac medical devices is certified by the International Organization for Standardization ISO/
IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC27018:2014, and we conduct business in compliance with applicable international laws and 
regulations governing product and data security. As a member of the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center 
(H-ISAC) community of private and public health organizations, we can access and share security best practices and threat 
intelligence across the health care and public health sectors.
Ensuring product security
In 2021, we expanded our product security approach to 
include multiple layers of risk analysis for every hardware 
and software component, while using penetration testing 
— a form of security testing used to better understand 
potential weaknesses that could be exploited — to 
identify vulnerabilities. Our product lifecycle security 
practices cover the design, sourcing, manufacturing and 
support of all devices according to our cybersecurity 
protocols that are incorporated into our global quality 
system. We also monitor various threat intelligence 
feeds for high profile vulnerabilities that may impact our 
products and post regular product vulnerability updates.
Here are some of the actions we take to ensure 
transparency: 
• Open communication: Our external Boston 
Scientific Product Security website communicates 
with customers, patients and caregivers about 
security findings.• Information sharing: We are an active member 
of the Health Information Sharing and Analysis 
Center (H-ISAC). We have a process in place for 
coordinated vulnerability disclosures to ensure that 
our customers and patients are notified of critical 
security vulnerabilities and mitigations as needed in 
coordination with researchers and the U.S. Department 
of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity & Infrastructure 
Security Agency.

security on our website .
Protecting data security
Boston Scientific products may hold and transmit 
sensitive personal data. We protect this data with 
protocols that honor provider and patient privacy. 
Our teams uphold standards for data privacy with 
industry-leading data protection practices that protect 
confidential health care provider and patient information 
from unauthorized disclosures. The company has data 
security and incident response plans that address 
potential threats to information privacy across all product 
portfolios. We regularly conduct awareness outreach with 
employees and external health providers to educate them about various types of data, privacy and security best practices 
and their role in protecting private information.
2021 regulatory and privacy objectives include:
• Privacy impact assessments: We require all employees 
to submit impact assessments for any products, processes 
and initiatives that collect, use, manage or process personal 
data as part of the company’s culture of ensuring privacy 
by design and default. In 2021, the Global Privacy team 
reviewed over 500 privacy impact assessments.
• Protecting COVID data privacy: We introduced a COVID-19 
vaccine tracking tool that complied with rapidly changing 
government regulations and enabled employees access to 
our sites and to customers. We protected employee and 
visitor privacy according to each jurisdiction and ensured 
that employees controlled their data for the purpose of 
contact tracing. 
• Companywide data privacy training: We launched an 
employee training program with content tailored to different 
areas and functions, to make the training relevant to 
employees’ day-to-day work. Different training scenarios 
helped Boston Scientific employees who interact with 
customers to understand the types of data they may 
engage with and their responsibility to protect information 
and report privacy concerns.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words like “anticipate,” “expect,” “project,” “believe,” 
“plan,” “may,” “estimate,” “intend” and similar words. These forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and 
estimates using information available to us at the time and are not intended to be guarantees of future events or performance. These 
forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our expected net sales; reported, operational and organic 
revenue growth rates; reported and adjusted EPS for the second quarter and full year 2022; our financial performance; our business 
and environmental, social and governance (ESG) plans, performance and goals; product performance; and the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on the company’s results of operations. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or if certain risks or uncertainties 
materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking 
statements. These factors, in some cases, have affected and in the future (together with other factors) could affect our ability to implement 
our business strategy and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements expressed in this report. 
As a result, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements.
Risks and uncertainties that may cause such differences include, among other things: the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on 
our operations and financial results; future U.S. and global economic, political, competitive, reimbursement and regulatory conditions; 
manufacturing, distribution and supply chain disruptions and cost increases; disruptions caused by cybersecurity events; disruptions 
caused by extreme weather or other climate change-related events; labor shortages and increases in labor costs; new product 
introductions; expected procedural volumes; the closing and integration of acquisitions; demographic trends; intellectual property rights; 
litigation; financial market conditions; the execution and effect of our business strategy, including our cost-savings and growth initiatives; 
and future business decisions made by us and our competitors. New risks and uncertainties may arise from time to time and are difficult 
to predict, including those that have emerged or have increased in significance or likelihood as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. All of 
these factors are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of them are beyond our control. For a further list and description 
of these and other important risks and uncertainties that may affect our future operations, see Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors in our most 
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we may update in Part II, Item 1A — Risk 
Factors in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q we have filed or will file hereafter. We disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly update or 
revise any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which those 
expectations may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward-looking 
statements. This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this report.
