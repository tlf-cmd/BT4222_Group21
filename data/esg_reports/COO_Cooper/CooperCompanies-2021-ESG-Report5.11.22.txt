Data and Performance I am proud to share our  
CY 2021 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) highlights report, which reflects our ESG performance over the past year.
2021, like the year before, 
was marked by the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic and its increasing impact on the global supply chain. But it also illustrated the unwavering resilience of Cooper employees and their commitment to improving lives one person at a time. Less than 12 months after sharing our ESG framework with you in our inaugural ESG report, I am proud of the success we have achieved in the three areas that make up our ESG Framework: people, planet, and partnerships.
Our investment in developing life-changing 
solutions continued to drive value for both  our Company and patients. 
We reached a significant milestone when the Chinese 
National Medical Products Administration, which regulates medical devices and pharmaceuticals in China, approved CooperVision MiSight®
  1 day 
contact lenses in August 2021.1 MiSight® is proven 
to prevent Myopia (nearsightedness or short-sightedness) progression,
2 which is estimated to 
impact 80% of Chinese high school students.3 With 
this approval, MiSight is now available in 38 countries worldwide. 
We also continued to support the education of eye 
care professionals and their ability to serve patients.  This included our partnership with the Special Olympics Lions Clubs International Foundation Opening Eyes® program, which increases vision care inclusion and access for athletes with intellectual disabilities. Read more on page 22. 
Going into 2021, CooperSurgical already offered 
a broad array of medical devices and services that support healthy women, babies, and families, including contraception, surgical instruments, IVF supplies, and genomic testing. In 2021, we expanded our portfolio and pipeline through the acquisition of Generate Life Sciences, a leading provider of donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments, fertility cryopreservation services, and newborn stem cell storage. This will allow us to accelerate innovation in this growing area of unmet need. 
Protecting our planet and preserving resources is an 
integral part of our commitment to improving lives. 
In 2021, we continued to address the growing global 
challenge of plastic in our oceans through the creation of the first net plastic-neutral contact lens. In our first year, our plastic neutrality
4 partnership with Plastic Bank 
prevented the equivalent of nearly 28 million plastic bottles from polluting the ocean.

But we aren’t stopping there – we are implementing a four-step circularity approach to engineer value into our entire plastic value chain. Read more on page 17. 
Leading our progress in 2021 were more than 
12,000 employees who make up the purpose-driven, dynamic team that is ONECOOPER. 
Together, we have taken significant steps in building an 
inclusive, healthy, safe, and engaged workforce. This year, we launched our CooperPride employee resource A Message from our CEO
ALBERT G. WHITE III, 
President and Chief Executive Officer
1 On August 6, 2021, the Chinese National Medical Products Administration approved CooperVision MiSight®  1 day contact lenses for use within the country following a priority review. 
2 MiSight® is indicated for the correction of myopia for patients with non-diseased phakic eyes, who at the initiation of treatment are 8-12 years of age and have a refraction of -0.75 D to -4.00 D with ≤ 0.75 diopters of astigmatism; Meanwhile, it has 
the dual focal design with alternative multiple rings, which allows part of the light passing through the optical zone to focus in front of the retina, forming myopic defocus, and expecting to slow down the change of axial length of the patients. Fitting and 
evaluation of the product should be in medical institutions by ophthalmologists with intermediate title or above and conduct regular check. It must be used in strict accordance with the IFU requirements. 
3 National Health Commission. 13 July 2021. Myopia survey conducted from September to December 2020, covering 8,604 schools across the country and screening a total of 2.477 million students. Retrieved from: http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xwzb/

plastic in participating brand orders in a specified time period.  Plastic in participating brand plastic is determined by the weight of plastic in the blister, the lens, and the secondary package, including laminates, adhesives, and  auxiliary inputs (e.g., ink).

by Fortune Magazine  naming our Company, as well as 
our CooperVision and CooperSurgical divisions, one of its 2021 Best Large Workplaces in Manufacturing & Production™ for the second year in a row. 
I am also pleased to share that CooperCompanies 
became a corporate participant of the United Nations' Global Compact, the world’s largest voluntary corporate sustainability initiative that calls on companies to align strategies and operations with universal principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. As a participant of the Global Compact, we are committed to its principles and to reporting on our progress in implementing them in future reports. 
Looking ahead, I am excited about the future of

 Our People Kimberly Tomczyk participated in a highly interactive mentoring 
initiative called the Mentoring Tree Program, introduced by our African-Decent Employee Resource Group. This collaborative, group-learning style involves one mentor working with several mentees and builds a cohesive learning group that can continue to collaborate even after the formal program ends. For Tomczyk, the opportunity helped her build skills in self-promotion. “Being a part of the Mentor Tree Program has given me the opportunity to engage with experienced leaders while learning from fellow mentees as well. Recently, the topic of self-promotion ignited a great conversation between us that inspired me to advocate for myself. This resulted in an impactful change for my position,”

connect, educate, and celebrate with each other.
In 2021, CooperPride ERG members partnered with Cooper’s 
Human Resources team to review U.S. benefits coverage to confirm parity for same sex partners. The ERG also hosted educational seminars across all geographies on LGBTQ+ equality. These learning resources will be part of Cooper’s D&I toolkit for managers and employees in 2022.
This effort helped Cooper earn a perfect score of 100% on the 2022 Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. This leading national benchmarking tool rates corporate policies, practices, and benefits for 
LGBTQ+ employees and has been credited as the primary driving force for LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion.

 Our People T alent Acquisition Team Makes Job Descriptions 
More Accessible and Inclusive 
Jennifer Forty, T alent Acquisition Manager at CooperVision, 
knows that a job posting is more than an alert about employment opportunity. For many job seekers, it provides a powerful first impression – a proxy for a company’s culture and core values. 
“Companies need to choose their words wisely when writing job 
posts, otherwise, they risk losing access to a more diverse and adept talent pool,” Forty explained. 
In 2021, Forty helped CooperCompanies and its business units 
launch a pilot in the U.S. to update job descriptions with more inclusive and accessible language. This included using technology to analyze and improve content for approachability, people-first language, and to eliminate corporate clichés. 
She pointed out that familiar terms like “salesmen” can be replaced 
with more inclusive language like “salespeople” or “sales team.” Likewise, she says that changing words such as “utilize” to “use” and “serve as” to “be” helps ensure that job descriptions have more accessible language, which many candidates appreciate.
15 Data do not include employees who chose not to specify gender. In 2022, we introduced a 
“non-specified” category and will include data in future reports when three years of data is available.

CooperVision T ackles the Impact of  
Plastic Through a Circularity Approach 
Advances in plastic technologies have changed the world over the past  
100 years. Today, we produce high-quality, durable, and sterilized daily 
contact lenses, which help minimize eye infection and increase convenience. 
Despite advances in eye health, we recognize that plastic waste and carbon 
emissions are serious issues impacting the environment – especially the world’s oceans. That is why we are investing in people and new technologies to bring our four-part circularity approach to life. We are embedding this approach into our product development and design processes. Through this four-part model, our teams are testing, learning, and deploying different circularity concepts across different products to investigate where opportunities exist today, while pushing the boundaries of tomorrow.

to create the first net plastic-neutral contact lens.22 Plastic Bank, a social 
enterprise that builds ethical recycling ecosystems in coastal communities, enables individuals to receive income by collecting ocean-bound plastic waste. 
In 2021, Cooper purchased credits from Plastic Bank to collect the equivalent 
amount of plastic from the environment for every box of lenses distributed by participating brands
23 in the U.S. and for all 1-day contact lenses in Europe. 
Plastic Bank then converts the collected plastic into reusable feedstock. In its first year, the partnership prevented the equivalent of nearly 28 million plastic bottles from polluting the ocean

 Our Planet CooperVision Engineers and Scientists Work Together to Create 
Solutions to Reduce Waste 
The majority of the waste in our value chain comes from packaging. In 2020, Javier E. Alayon 
Rivera, Lead Principal Engineer at CooperVision, took the first steps on an aggressive approach to develop new packaging solutions for our blister pack (the small pack that contains the individual contact lens). 
"I love challenges and this one, because of its sustainability aspect, struck a personal chord with me,” said Alayon. “In my own life, I try to do my part to help reduce waste. I started to imagine a future where we really reduced the number of blisters that go into the landfill and knew that would be hugely impactful.”
JAVIER E. ALAYON RIVERA 
Paul Riggs, Science & Sustainability Director at CooperVision, oversees all material science initiatives, key global sustainability campaigns, and the sustainability roadmap for CooperVision global manufacturing operations. Working with an internal team of science experts, he is supporting Alayon Rivera and looking for emerging technologies that could help CooperVision and its customers reduce their overall impact on the environment. 
Together, Alayon, Riggs, and their teams are examining different materials to reimagine the blister packs, including non-virgin and renewable material. In 2021, the team showed through a financial and feasibility analysis, that both alternative materials and increasing the recyclability of the packs is possible. Next comes testing, which the teams plan to begin in 2022. 
“The challenge has just started,” Alayon said, “but I am really hopeful we can do it. 
We’re not just solving today’s problem but are looking five to 10 years ahead and, ultimately, creating better solutions for tomorrow.”
The next step is to find a way to increase the recyclability of the packs."I’m excited to be helping people move along the circularity journey,” said Riggs. “It will 
take ingenuity, perseverance, and collaboration. Fortunately, at CooperVision we have a lot of all three.”

 Our Planet Building Climate Resiliency and a 
Competitive Advantage in Puerto Rico
In the town of Juana Diaz, near Puerto Rico’s 
southwestern coast, CooperVision manufactures more contact lenses than anywhere else in the world. For more than 23 years, the site had relied on a stable source of energy from the island’s power grid, but in recent years the grid has been weakened by a series of hurricanes and other natural disasters. 
In 2017, Hurricane María, the largest and most 
destructive hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in the past century, devastated the island’s infrastructure and left most people without electricity for months. 
“We knew that the island hadn’t seen its last storm,” 
recalls Efrain Oliveras Villafane, Associate Infrastructure Director at the CooperVision Juana Diaz site. “Even before María paid us a visit, we had begun to prepare.” 
Working with a cross-functional team of colleagues 
from Finance, Operations, and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS), Oliveras Villafane and his team identified a solution that would not only provide a reliable source of energy in the face of the next María, but would also be sustainable, clean, and cost-effective. In 2020, the site began construction of a 23.3 megawatt and 3,000 refrigeration ton Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system and company-controlled microgrid. It began operations in 2022. By capturing and using heat that would otherwise be wasted, and by avoiding distribution losses, the natural gas-fueled CHP has an expected efficiency of 84% – significantly more efficient than conventional on-site diesel or propane-powered generators. 
In addition, the site is being built in alignment with 
leading construction codes, helping to prepare it to withstand the impacts of possible earthquakes and hurricane-force winds. 
We pride ourselves on being a good neighbor and once 
complete, the system could also offer support to the community during future natural disasters.
The CHP system checked all of our boxes – it provides grid resiliency and the power 
and chilled water we need for our operations today and in the future, while also resulting in cost reductions, price stability, and decreased carbon emissions,” said Damaris Santiago Lebron, director of EHS for CooperVision Americas Manufacturing Operations. “The team did more than safeguard the site; they provided a competitive advantage for CooperVision by helping us keep power on 24/7 and deliver a continuous supply of products to the market in a sustainable way.”

 Our Planet CooperSurgical Finds an Untraditional Partner  
to Help Reduce Plastic – Local Sheep 
One major contributor to plastic pollution in the healthcare sector is polystyrene,25 
which is used to ship items, such as invitro fertilization products, that need to 
be kept at low temperatures. In 2021, CooperSurgical shifted to an eco-friendly alternative in Australia and New Zealand called Woolpack. It is made from 100% discarded wool from sheep, that is then sterilized and wrapped in compostable insulation. It is reusable, recyclable, and biodegradable. 
“We love Woolpack and so do our customers,” said Ingrid Hughes, Customer 
Experience Manager, CooperSurgical in Australia/New Zealand. “They take up less space, are easier to manage for our customers, and are better for the environment. Every step counts, and we are happy to be leading the way.” 2021 2020 2019

 Our Partnerships This support included providing Special Olympics athletes with 
high-quality vision and eye health screenings, prescription eyewear and sports goggles, and educational resources, such as videos about the anatomy of the eye and how to care for glasses and contact lenses. 
The partnership also provided improved education and training 
for vision care professionals and optometry students. These resources included webinars and e-learning modules focused on the visual and eye health needs of persons with intellectual disabilities.Global Marketing Team Increases Vision Care Inclusion  
for Special Olympians
Across the world, individuals with intellectual disabilities remain one of the most socially isolated, at-risk populations. Many with vision needs go unnoticed because too few vision care professionals are trained in how best to support them.
Beth Clark, Senior Manager, Marketing Communications at CooperVision 
Specialty EyeCare – Americas, has been instrumental in helping to address this challenge. She leads the CooperVision partnership with Special Olympics Lions Clubs International Foundation Opening Eyes® program.
In 2021, CooperVision and Optometry Giving Sight provided financial and 
technical support during programming for the Special Olympics in Kenya and will help do the same in the United States in 2022.
26 Source: Special Olympics, "Inclusive Health - Opening Eyes," 2019 It is our goal to enlighten eye care 
professionals about the unique and unmet needs of those with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and to connect these eye care professionals with the education and training that will improve access to and quality of eyecare for this underserved population.”

 Our Partnerships CooperVision South Africa Provides 
Access to Vision Screening
Visual impairment is a significant public health 
concern, with blindness and moderate to severe visual impairment affecting an estimated 253 million people worldwide.
27 The prevalence is proportionally 
higher in low- and middle-income countries,28 often 
due to insufficient human resources,29 unaffordable 
or unavailable medication,30 inadequate service 
coverage for vision assessments,31 complex referral 
systems, and lack of transportation to specialized services.
32 When visual impairment is diagnosed 
early, up to 80% is preventable and treatable.33
In South Africa, CooperVision is working to make a difference through a partnership with the African Eye Institute, Essilor, and Peek Vision. Together, we are striving to increase access to vision screening and care for children from disadvantaged communities.
In 2021, with a grant of nearly $40,000 from 
CooperVision, the partnership conducted screening events at 13 schools, reaching more than 10,000 students. When eye conditions were identified, children were provided either free glasses or referred to a nearby clinic for additional care. 
CooperVision plans to continue its support and add 
an employee volunteer component in 2022, with a goal of reaching an additional 12 schools. 
CooperSurgical Helps Patients 
Access Critical Care During COVID-19 Hospital Interruptions 
Abnormal uterine bleeding accounts for one-third 
of all women’s health visits and yet the diagnostic process is prolonged and involved for most patients. 
Delays in diagnosis and treatment became even 
more acute during the COVID-19 pandemic when hospitals were deluged with critical care patients, leaving little to no room for other procedures. For many women, this meant months-long waits for an examination of their cervical canal and endometrial cavity through a process known as a hysteroscopy, often conducted in hospitals. For years, CooperSurgical has been developing innovative technologies to shift medical procedures from hospitals to office settings. Products such as Endosee® Advance allow healthcare providers to examine parts of the female genital tract in a gynecological office. By receiving care in the office, women can get the care they need when they need it without additional visits in higher-level-of-care settings like the operating room. Office-based care can not only increase access for patients, but research
34 finds it can also help lower health care 
system costs – which is also critical for addressing access disparities and outcome inequalities.
Providing the gift of sight is one 
of the most fundamental ways we can support local communities. We are proud to work with partners who share our ambition to help children access the eye care they need to thrive.”
