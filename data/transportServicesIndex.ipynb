The index measures the month-to-month changes in the amount of freight transported by for-hire transportation providers in the United States, including rail, trucking, inland waterways, pipelines, and air freight.\n",

    "- The Passenger Transportation Services Index (TSI) is another monthly economic indicator published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in the United States Department of Transportation. It measures the month-to-month changes in the amount of passenger transportation provided by for-hire transportation providers in the United States, including air, rail, transit, and intercity bus.\n",

The series provides monthly estimates of the number of unlinked passenger trips on public transit systems in urbanized areas and certain other regions of the country.\n",
