8,Line 9,"DATA WORKFORCE ENVIRONMENT SUPPLY CHAIN GOVERNANCE QUALITY AND SAFETY ESG APPENDIX 2021 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY ABOUT A Message From Our Chairman and CEO  Dear Abbott Stakeholder, As we approach our 135th year in business,  it’s clear that Abbott is a company that  endures.
"
9,Line 10,"That’s because we’ve long  understood that the key to sustaining our  enterprise is a willingness to evolve it, to  anticipate changes in the environment and to  adapt Abbott in ways that make us best able to  achieve our fundamental purpose — helping  people live healthier, fuller lives.
"
10,Line 11,"We’ve amply demonstrated that ability  throughout our history, strategically  reshaping Abbott to become one of the  world’s leading health technology companies,  with a broad portfolio and global reach that  let us help more people than ever before.
"
11,Line 12,"The past few years have been among the  most challenging in our lifetimes, but they’ve  also highlighted for us the critical nature of  the work we do and the significant positive  impact we can have for patients and for the  communities in which we operate.
"
12,Line 13,"But we know that if we want to sustain that  impact in a changing world, we can’t rely  on the same playbooks we’ve used before.
"
13,Line 14,"So, incorporating input from internal and external stakeholders, we developed a 10-year  plan to identify the areas we need to focus on  in order to grow sustainably.
"
14,Line 15,"Central to this plan is the idea that we can do  the most good by pursuing our fundamental  mission as a company: bringing life-changing  technologies and products to the people and  places that need them.
"
15,Line 16,"That’s why we’re  building affordability into our products to  increase access to them, and breaking down  barriers that prevent people from getting  the care they need.
"
16,Line 17,"And to support that  core purpose, we’ve set ourselves ambitious  goals in key areas that strengthen our  foundation for the future, including building  the workforce of tomorrow, responsibly  applying data to advance care, building a  more resilient, diverse and responsible supply  chain, and protecting health by safeguarding  the environment.
"
17,Line 18,"This report is the first to detail the progress  we’ve made on these 2030 goals and, as you’ll  read, we’re making real strides in all of these  areas.
"
18,Line 19,"We’re setting the foundation for our  long-term success, but we’re also remaining  responsive to the pressing issues of today.For example, our contributions to the fight  against COVID-19 remained important and  impactful (see page 6).
"
19,Line 20,"We also stepped up  in a variety of ways in response to the crisis  in Ukraine, donating $6 million in funding  and much-needed products to rebuild  critical healthcare infrastructure and deliver  emergency and primary healthcare services  and supplies, working with humanitarian  organizations including International  Medical Corps, Americares, CARE and   Project HOPE.
"
20,Line 21,"The values that drove those actions were  also in evidence in our decision, in 2022,  to recall infant formula produced at one of  our U.S. plants (see page 60).
"
21,Line 22,"Our people  are committed to our Customer Pledge to  make our products as if they’re for our own  families; and we’ll be redoubling our efforts –  across every business, across every part of the  globe – to ensure that our long-established  reputation for excellence and the highest  product quality will remain our bedrock.
"
22,Line 23,"At Abbott, we’re in the business of making  people’s lives better, and we manage all  aspects of the company to ensure we’ll  be doing that for decades to come.
"
23,Line 24,"Our  fundamental goal is simple: we are working  for a world with fewer barriers — one that  enables people to live their fullest possible  lives — creating healthier people, healthier  communities and a healthier world.
"
