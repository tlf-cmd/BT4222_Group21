The center combines shipments from different warehouse locations in Europe and optimizes loads so that containers are less likely to be shipped partially full.,BAX_2020.pdf
This reduces the total number of containers shipped and saves money while increasing supply frequency.,BAX_2020.pdf
"We increased the scope of this center in 2020 and started using higher capacity containers for some shipments, which increases the number of pallets per container by 30%.",BAX_2020.pdf

Following are a few key examples: • New peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients must have a catheter inserted into their abdominal area to facilitate home treatment.,BAX_2020.pdf
"This became challenging during the pandemic, as some facilities deemed this to be an elective procedure.",BAX_2020.pdf
"To support access to this essential procedure that enables home dialysis, Baxter worked with healthcare professionals, medical societies and ministries of health globally to advocate for patients’ access to the procedure.",BAX_2020.pdf
"For example, we worked with the ministries of health in Australia and India to recognize catheter insertion as a non-elective procedure, and even an emergency procedure as needed, removing a roadblock for patients in need of PD care.",BAX_2020.pdf
"Baxter also successfully advocated for this in the United States, among other countries.",BAX_2020.pdf
• In response to the pandemic many healthcare professionals rapidly adjusted practices in their clinics and began supporting an increased number of home patients.,BAX_2020.pdf
"As home dialysis rates continue to rise, so does the demand for nurses who have the expertise to successfully manage a PD program.",BAX_2020.pdf
"In response, we created programs such as the PD Excellence Academy, a virtual training platform and educational resource center to help nurses develop PD skills for optimal patient care.",BAX_2020.pdf
"Baxter designed the PD Excellence Academy training resources to provide standardized, evidence-based and actionable curriculum in a convenient and easily accessible virtual format.",BAX_2020.pdf
"• Around the world, local teams actively engaged with policy makers to support healthcare professionals’ ability to adopt and implement digital health tools to remotely manage patient care.",BAX_2020.pdf
"For example, the Baxter team in South Korea worked with the ministry of health to gain temporary approval to provide reimbursement for dialysis providers that use Baxter’s Sharesource remote patient management platform, which enables healthcare providers to remotely monitor their home patients’ treatments.",BAX_2020.pdf
About half the hospitals in South Korea that treat PD patients (54 hospitals in total) were included in the first phase of this program during 2020.,BAX_2020.pdf
"• To further foster global support of patients’ access to home care during the pandemic, we hosted the first International Home Dialysis Roundtable.",BAX_2020.pdf
"The two-day meeting was the first global gathering of all the major nephrology societies, patient organizations and key opinion leaders on the topic of how to help dialysis patients during this time.",BAX_2020.pdf

• We initiated a global Safer at Home awareness campaign to help educate patients and key stakeholders about home care as an important therapy option during this time and to discourage slow starts on therapy or patients opting out of therapy for fear of contracting the virus.,BAX_2020.pdf
"During 2020, we also continued to provide patient care through our Baxter Renal Care Services.",BAX_2020.pdf

"Though estimations vary, it is believed that up to nearly 10 million people worldwide require renal therapy, yet fewer than 3 million people receive treatment.1 Home-based PD offers patients the opportunity to manage their therapy at home, provides equal or better outcomes for many and is often less costly when compared with clinic-based hemodialysis.",BAX_2021.pdf
"PD also provides patients, who have immune dysfunction, an opportunity to socially distance themselves to reduce the risk of viral infections, such as COVID-19.",BAX_2021.pdf
"In 2021, we focused on the following programs and activities as we began laying the foundation to increase access to PD in developing countries.",BAX_2021.pdf
"Hosted second International Home Dialysis Roundtable Sponsored hands-on PD catheter training for nearly 400 nephrologists from 19 countries 50,000+ patients in 70 countries connected to their clinicians via Sharesource APPROACH TO REACHING RENAL PATIENTS IN UNDERSERVED MARKETS We are taking a three-pronged approach to reach our 2030 goal.",BAX_2021.pdf

"In 2021, we continued to use social media channels to drive awareness globally and sponsor patient societies in delivering educational campaigns to their members and the general public.",BAX_2021.pdf
"We also launched the MyKidneyJourney website, which was available in 28 countries as of the end of 2021, including many developing countries.",BAX_2021.pdf
This locally customizable website provides objective pre-dialysis education for patients and caregivers who are seeking additional disease and therapy information.,BAX_2021.pdf
"Although clinicians can direct patients to the site, it does not require clinician referral, making it easy to access for patients and family members.",BAX_2021.pdf
"In addition, we established our PD Ambassador Program in 2021.",BAX_2021.pdf
"Through this program, we invited local opinion leaders to learn more about the current clinical benefits of PD, the role they play in shared decision making and patient choice, the importance of home dialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, and digital health with the Sharesource remote patient management platform as a home therapy enabler.",BAX_2021.pdf
"By the end of the year, we had established a group of 50 PD Ambassadors from 30 countries2 who can consistently communicate the benefits of PD and advocate for its use.",BAX_2021.pdf
"Advocating for Access to PD We support public policies, economic analyses and collaborations that advance access to PD.",BAX_2021.pdf
"In 2021, we hosted a second International Home Dialysis Roundtable to continue work that this same group began in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",BAX_2021.pdf
This group continues collaborating to identify and help address the global challenges and opportunities related to access to home dialysis.,BAX_2021.pdf
"These annual discussions are unique in that they represent a broad, multinational gathering of patient advocacy groups, clinical societies and industry representatives from 27 countries, including developing countries in Asia Pacific, Europe and other regions.",BAX_2021.pdf
"While the roundtable was originally created to confront access-to-care challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the forum also identified the benefit of prioritizing and addressing—either individually or in collaboration—systemic challenges to home dialysis on an ongoing basis.",BAX_2021.pdf
"This group was responsible for an important call to action, published in Kidney Medicine , and several advocacy outreach communications to policymakers throughout the year.",BAX_2021.pdf
Expanding Innovation and Services Innovation that meets the local needs of patients is critical to expanding access to care.,BAX_2021.pdf
"With the proper awareness and education, we are working to expand access to our PD portfolio, including our digital health platform, in developing countries.",BAX_2021.pdf
"For example, Sharesource remote patient management, our digital health platform, allows healthcare profession - als to securely view data from their patients’ recently completed home dialysis treatment, which is automati- cally collected after each automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) session.",BAX_2021.pdf
"With real-time access to treatment data through Sharesource, healthcare professionals can remotely adjust patients’ home device settings without requiring additional trips to the clinic.",BAX_2021.pdf
"Sharesource leads to other therapeutic benefits, including fewer dropouts, improved adherence, and improved patient-reported outcomes, as well as cost reduction.",BAX_2021.pdf
"More than 50,000 Awareness and Training for PD Catheters In order to begin PD therapy, a patient must have a catheter inserted into their abdominal area.",BAX_2021.pdf
Completing this critical first step in a timely manner is a common barrier to PD therapy adoption and was especially challenging during the height of the pandemic when several countries deemed PD catheter insertion to be elective and suspended the procedure along with other elective surgeries.,BAX_2021.pdf
"To support access to life-saving PD therapy, Baxter worked with healthcare professionals, medical societies and ministries of health globally to have catheter insertion procedures deemed an essential, non-deferable procedure, removing one barrier to patients beginning PD therapy.",BAX_2021.pdf
"In 2021, we launched an educational campaign directed at nephrologists interested in placing catheters.",BAX_2021.pdf
"The campaign included webinars, instructional videos, e-learning modules and interactive aids to raise awareness and encourage nephrologists to add PD catheter insertion to their practices.",BAX_2021.pdf
"We also sponsored hands-on PD catheter training programs that trained nearly 400 nephrologists from 19 countries, including Algeria, Bahrain, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, Oman, Poland, Slovenia, South Africa, Sudan, Tunisia, Turkey and UAE.",BAX_2021.pdf

"Of these emissions, 17,100 metric tons CO2e are Scope 1 emissions attributed to our distribu - tion vehicles and covered by our carbon neutrality goal.Baxter’s approach to improving efficiency and decreasing emissions from product transport includes: Technology innovation: In 2021, the primary transpor - tation service provider utilized by Baxter for our UK customers began replacing fossil fuels with biofuel.",BAX_2021.pdf
"This conversion helped reduce GHG emissions associ- ated with our UK transportation activities by more than 2,000 metric tons CO2e in 2021 and is expected to reduce GHG emissions by about 4,000 metric tons CO2e on an annual basis.12 We also started using biofuel for our distribution activities in Brazil, specifically in the regions of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo and the countryside of São Paulo.",BAX_2021.pdf
The switch to biofuel helped us reduce our GHG emissions by approximately 300 metric tons CO2e in 2021.,BAX_2021.pdf
"In addition, for export shipments out of Europe, we implemented a project to shift 700 temperature- controlled shipping containers per year to standard, non-temperature-controlled containers.",BAX_2021.pdf
"We estimate this will reduce associated GHG emissions by more than 1,000 metric tons CO2e annually.12 Environmentally responsible partnerships: Baxter participates in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay program as both a Carrier and Shipper Partner.",BAX_2021.pdf
"We also participate in the Clean Cargo initiative, which focuses on environmentally responsible ocean shipping.",BAX_2021.pdf
Baxter uses EcoTransIT software and methodology to capture and report our emissions data in alignment with industry bes t practices.,BAX_2021.pdf
These partnerships help Baxter calculate our transportation emissions with greater accuracy.,BAX_2021.pdf
"Modal shift: In 2021, we changed the default mode of transport for our elastomeric infusion pumps from air to sea between the United States and Europe, decreasing costs and GHG emissions.",BAX_2021.pdf
"Congestion in some U.S. ports prevented conversion of all shipments, but we expect to expand this practice in future years.",BAX_2021.pdf
The temporary obstruction of the Suez Canal in 2021 significantly delayed ocean shipments between Europe and Asia and impacted global supply chains.,BAX_2021.pdf
"As Baxter worked to mitigate supply disruptions for our customers and patients, we shipped more than 1,200 metric tons of products by rail instead of air between Europe and China.",BAX_2021.pdf
"This helped us avoid an additional 8,000 metric tons CO2e of GHG emissions that would have occurred if those products had instead been shipped by air.",BAX_2021.pdf
"Optimizing the distribution network: The majority of our EMEA export shipments pass through our ocean export consolidation center in Antwerp, Belgium, where shipments from different warehouses throughout Europe are combined to ensure optimized loads.",BAX_2021.pdf
This reduces the total number of containers shipped and saves money while increasing supply frequency.,BAX_2021.pdf
"In addition, we are moving production for some products closer to the markets those products serve.",BAX_2021.pdf
"For example, we began producing hemodialysis products bound for our European market in Malta rather than in Mexico.",BAX_2021.pdf
"In 2021, we improved the pallet configuration for transportation of our renal solutions manufactured in Canlubang, Philippines, and transported to India and Thailand.",BAX_2021.pdf
Transporting more products per pallet results in fewer containers; we expect this to reduce GHG emissions by about 60 metric tons CO2e annually.12 MOVING FORWARD >> Technology transformation across Baxter will support a more refined understanding of our GHG emissions and help us drive progress and capitalize on the growing demand for lower-carbon healthcare products.,BAX_2021.pdf
"As we work to cut our own GHG emissions over the next decade, we will continue to prioritize energy efficiency initiatives and renewable electricity use, including purchased electricity and on-site projects, such as biomass.",BAX_2021.pdf
"For example, we are planning to install cogeneration to supply electricity to two of our manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico.",BAX_2021.pdf
"In addition to providing the sites with a less carbon intensive source of electricity, these projects will make the sites more resilient to disruptions in service from the local utility due to extreme weather events, such as Hurricane Maria in 2017.",BAX_2021.pdf

Our only responsibilities were to provide independent assurance on the accuracy and reliability of the Selected Information; to form an independent conclusion based on the assurance procedures performed and evidence obtained; and to report our conclusions.,BAX_2018.pdf
"Assessment Standard and Reporting Criteria We performed our work in accordance with BVNA’s standard procedures and guidelines for external Assurance of Sustainability Reports and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (effective for assurance reports dated on or after December 15, 2015), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.",BAX_2018.pdf
"The Reporting Criteria for this assurance were Baxter’s reporting requirements for facility Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability performance.",BAX_2018.pdf
"The work was planned and carried out to provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance of the Selected Information except for the Responsible Procurement and Logistics section of the Report, which was carried out to provide limited assurance.",BAX_2018.pdf
We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for our conclusions.,BAX_2018.pdf
"Summary of Work Performed As part of BVNA’s assurance process, BVNA undertook the following activities: • Assessed the appropriateness of the Reporting Criteria for the Selected Information • Conducted interviews with relevant Baxter personnel responsible for collecting and reporting performance data and other subject matter for the Selected Information • Attended a conference call with Baxter representatives and stakeholders to observe management involvement and stakeholder inclusion in corporate responsibility at Baxter • Reviewed documentary evidence produced by Baxter to support the Selected Information • Assessed the disclosure and presentation of the Selected Information with emphasis on principles of accuracy, accessibility, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness and to ensure consistency with the Reporting Criteria • Audited performance data during visits to operating sites located in: Jayuya, Puerto Rico; Grosotto, Italy; Guangzhou, China; Mountain Home, Arkansas; Sondalo, Italy; and Tijuana, Mexico • Audited consolidated performance data including review of a sample of data-to-source documentation • Reviewed Baxter data and information systems used for collection, aggregation, analysis and review of Selected Information during visits to Baxter’s offices in Round Lake, Illinois, and Deerfield, Illinois, United States Conclusions On the basis of our methodology and the activities described above, it is our opinion that the Selected Information within the Product Innovation (except the Patient Safety and Quality subsection), Employee Health and Safety, Operations, and Serving Our Communities, Baxter World Environment Week sections of the Report and related material in the Report Appendix: • is accurate, reliable and free from material mistake or misstatement;• is presented in a clear, understandable and accessible manner; • is presented based on the Reporting Criteria; • provides a fair and balanced representation of activities; and • allows readers to form a balanced opinion of Baxter’s 2018 activities and performance.",BAX_2018.pdf
