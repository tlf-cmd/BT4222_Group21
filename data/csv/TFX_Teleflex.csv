"Material Reduction and Substitution: Reducing Consumption and Waste and Using Safer Alternatives Teleflex has focused on several different ways to reduce materials to minimize our environmental impact, including through reducing overall material use and waste as well as limiting the use of hazardous materials.",TFX_2020.pdf
Reducing the amount of material used to package our products means lowering our consumption and reducing waste.,TFX_2020.pdf
"Key initiatives have included changing from high impact polystyrene trays to a flexible form fill seal for over 100 product codes, moving to pre-filled syringe selection integrated packaging for over 500 product codes, reducing the corrugate size used in breathing circuits, and reducing the size of polybags used to package certain products, which has eliminated over 15,000 pounds of plastic per year.",TFX_2020.pdf
"The introduction of the UroLift ® UL2 System is expected to result in meaningful waste reduction and annual packaging material savings, in part due to the fact that the UL2 System allows healthcare professionals to re-use one handle during a procedure for all the required UL2 Cartridges rather than using a separate handle for each cartridge.",TFX_2020.pdf
"Across several key portfolios we have examined product designs in an effort to remove excess material used to manufacture products, eliminate unnecessary components, and remove extra items packed with products, such as printed instructions for use where possible, to reduce waste.",TFX_2020.pdf
These changes have resulted in a reduction in Teleflex’s use of resin for product production by over 5 million pounds per year.,TFX_2020.pdf
Teleflex is committed to substituting materials with safer alternatives wherever feasible.,TFX_2020.pdf
"In connection with initiatives to ensure compliance with the EU Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”), we are in the process of replacing certain materials in over 1,100 SKUs, which is projected to be complete by May 2024.",TFX_2020.pdf

We also included heat recovery as part of the upgrade.,TFX_2021.pdf
The variable speed drive led to a reduction in electricity use and the heat recovery element led to a reduction in gas usage.,TFX_2021.pdf

Commercial sites are governed by a simplified occupational health and safety management protocol and each CMS site must also have a professional acting as EHS advisor.,TFX_2021.pdf
"EHS risk management is a continual focus, and as such, the Teleflex EHS Risk Management Process is used to identify work-related hazards, apply the hierarchy of controls (in order to eliminate hazards and minimize risks) and identify the right blend of best practice risk controls.",TFX_2021.pdf
"We utilize the Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) model to drive continual improvement of occupational health and safety.",TFX_2021.pdf
"Non-Conformity detection and resolution (via corrective actions) also drive continual improvement, as do site based EHS Committees, with governance and auditing driven by the Global EHS Function.",TFX_2021.pdf
"Quality is driven by the requirement to identify and align with published best practice risk controls, with oversight by each site EHS Advisor and governance via Regional EHS Managers.",TFX_2021.pdf
"The EHS Risk Management process is first utilized when implementing the initial CMS at the specific site and re-triggered by the site‘s management of change (MOC) program, which helps capture change in the workplace, equipment, systems and people.",TFX_2021.pdf
"This is done by incident investigations; observation programs; task design/standard operating procedures, monitoring and supervision, and audit output.",TFX_2021.pdf

Our incident investigation process was created under the Risk Management Program (RMP) umbrella and aligns with Teleflex’s global standards for EHS incident management.,TFX_2021.pdf
The standard requires all EHS incidents to be investigated and at least one nonconformity to be identified (with corrective actions).,TFX_2021.pdf
Identification of root cause and corrective action(s) is the mechanism to determine where improvements are needed in the occupational health and safety management system.,TFX_2021.pdf
Employee Consultation It is particularly important for our employees to have a voice when it comes to their health and safety.,TFX_2021.pdf
"Our Global EHS Manual requires each site to facilitate employee communication channels and relay information or concerns to management about health and safety process changes, changes to site rules, or management systems.",TFX_2021.pdf
"Within each site’s Core Management System, employees can utilize our Grass Roots Zero Harm teams, the EHS committee interface or our Open and Just Culture.",TFX_2021.pdf
This also helps to encompass local or regional employee representative organizations (such as unions) into the communication and consultation processes.,TFX_2021.pdf
Each site has a local EHS committee in which employees can participate and consult.,TFX_2021.pdf
Information about work-related incidents and the output of investigations to address nonconformities is readily available at site level.,TFX_2021.pdf

Supervisors and management are also required to complete the same trainings.,TFX_2021.pdf
"Each site EHS Training Register captures aspects such as: training requirements, required frequency of retraining, completion target dates, and completion status.",TFX_2021.pdf
