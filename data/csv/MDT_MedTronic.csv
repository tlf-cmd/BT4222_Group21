"Changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns can result in chronic increased temperatures, decreased water availability, and increased operations costs from increased cooling and restricted water use.",MDT_2021.pdf
"We know that water stress and scarcity is a growing global concern, and Medtronic is preparing our business for a time when water resources are critically challenged in some regions.",MDT_2021.pdf
Assessing this risk allows us to identify the significance and potential impact to our business.,MDT_2021.pdf
"During FY20, we took an initial step toward incorporating scenario analysis into our climate-related strategies by conducting a water stress assessment using the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas.",MDT_2021.pdf
"With the Aqueduct online tool, we were able to assess current and future water stress through 2040 at Medtronic locations around the globe.",MDT_2021.pdf
"The assessment, which was limited to Medtronic facilities that use five million gallons of water or more annually, leveraged the Aqueduct Risk Atlas “optimistic,” “business as usual,” and “pessimistic” scenarios that are based on specific global temperature pathways.",MDT_2021.pdf
"We conducted a similar analysis of our top five contract manufacturers, scoping the assessment to locations relevant to Medtronic.",MDT_2021.pdf
