“The environment is key to antibiotic resistance.,BDX_2018.pdf
"Bacteria in soil, rivers and seawater can develop resistance through contact with resistant bacteria, antibiotics, and disinfectant agents released by human activity.",BDX_2018.pdf
"People and livestock can then be exposed to more resistant bacteria through food, water, and air.”7 Contaminants such as heavy metals and biocides or chemicals with antimicrobial properties (such as disinfectants and detergents) in industrial wastewater increases pressure on bacteria to become resistant, possibly multiresistant to such substances.",BDX_2018.pdf
Multiresistant genes can be passed to nonresistant bacteria and to the next generation.8Climate change can also exacerbate AMR.,BDX_2018.pdf
"A recent study9 found that antibiotic resistance can increase with local temperatures; “findings suggest that current forecasts of the burden of antibiotic resistance could be significant underestimates in the face of a growing population and climate change.”10 While further research is needed to understand the presence and impact of antimicrobial-resistant microbes in the environment and the direct risk posed to human health, it remains a shared global challenge.11 Our approach to sustainability recognizes the interconnected nature of ESG issues, and that the action we take to reduce our impact on the environment can contribute to larger efforts to tackle various threats to human health, such as AMR.",BDX_2018.pdf

"At BD, we recognize that we have a responsibility to address these issues head-on, using our scale and influence to drive continuous improvement across our society’s biggest challenges.",BDX_2020.pdf
"Our Purpose— advancing the world of health ™— points to where that influence is most obvious: in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic with solutions for diagnosis, treatment and prevention.",BDX_2020.pdf
"However, we’re more than a med tech innovator; we’re also an employer of more than 70,000 people around the world, a member of their communities and a community of our own.",BDX_2020.pdf
"Our manufacturing facilities produce billions of life-enhancing devices each year, employing thousands in high-quality jobs, and we seek to do it while minimizing our environmental impact, supporting the members of our global team, and standing up for what is right.",BDX_2020.pdf
"In 2015, we launched a broader, more integrated approach to sustainability, with goals in four key issue areas that reflected our ambitions for 2020.",BDX_2020.pdf
"It is an approach that has enabled our associates to rally around our purpose to develop innovative diagnostic solutions for COVID-19 in record time, increase the availability of products used in sample collection and the treatment of critically ill patients, and work with governments around the world to enable delivery of COVID-19 vaccinations.",BDX_2020.pdf

"This has been the framework for how we manage, and make an impact on, the most relevant social and environmental issues for our company: Innovation We are building a strong portfolio of innovations that address unmet clinical needs, developing solutions for both acute and nonacute settings.",BDX_2020.pdf
"We are also bringing to market products that meet patients where they are—whether it’s in the physician’s office, an outpatient surgery center, the hospital, a local retail pharmacy or in the patient’s own home.",BDX_2020.pdf
"In 2020, we leveraged our world-class manufacturing, research and development, global scale, and deep capabilities in software and informatics to respond with agility and urgency to the COVID-19 pandemic.",BDX_2020.pdf

"Other healthcare challenges did not disappear with the onset of the pandemic, however; the many innovations we developed and launched in 2020 serve the entire healthcare continuum, from discovery to diagnosis, to the process of care, to the treatment of disease.",BDX_2020.pdf
"Access Beyond the innovations we developed to expand COVID-19 diagnostic and vaccine delivery options globally, we continued to partner and collaborate with governments and nonprofit organizations around the world to address priority health needs.",BDX_2020.pdf
"This encompasses our work with organizations like Project HOPE to reduce infusion-related infections among healthcare workers in China; with the U.S. Agency for International Development and India’s National TB Elimination Program to improve access to, and increase capacity for, liquid culture and drug- susceptibility testing; and the many partnerships we’ve forged with leading health agencies and NGOs to raise awareness of the threat of antimicrobial resistance and help reduce the risk of infections globally.",BDX_2020.pdf
"BD was named to Corporate Responsibility Magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the fifth consecutive year in 2020, and for the fourth time in the last six years, Fortune magazine included BD on its annual list of companies that “Change the World”—this time for fulfilling critical healthcare needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.To our stakeholders Efficiency As I mentioned, BD is a vastly different organization than it was in 2015, and the integration of two large organizations has increased our complexity.",BDX_2020.pdf

"Performance factors include the site’s performance in EHS over the past 12 months, including the outcome of any inspections by relevant authorities.",BDX_2021.pdf
This enabled a more deliberate focus for the selection of sites to be audited during the year.,BDX_2021.pdf
"Audits are typically three full days and consist of an opening meeting, a site tour, document examination and finally, a closing meeting.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Findings are included in the audit tool, and the site is responsible for ensuring that all actions are closed out.",BDX_2021.pdf
Four different levels of findings are potentially recorded: repeat findings where an issue was raised previously in an audit and deemed to be open again; high-level findings where there is a serious potential environmental or health-and-safety impact; medium-level findings in which there is a systemic issue; and low-level findings in which the issue is administrative or an isolated one-off.,BDX_2021.pdf
"Executive summaries from each audit are provided to site management, operational leaders, EHS business team leaders, VP S&EHS, EVP ISC and the CEO.",BDX_2021.pdf
All corrective actions are tracked to closure with follow-up audits carried out approximately six and 12 months later to verify completion.,BDX_2021.pdf
"Once findings are verified and closed, the site will be issued a closure confirmation from the central EHS team to document that the findings are effectively closed out.",BDX_2021.pdf
"In FY 2022, all findings that remain open after the follow-up audit are tracked on a monthly basis and are communicated to top management and the CEO.",BDX_2021.pdf
"As a result of the ongoing pandemic, in FY 2022, the audit team launched a hybrid approach to auditing at several high-hazard facilities.",BDX_2021.pdf
These sites must submit relevant documentation for review in advance of an in-person audit later in the year.,BDX_2021.pdf
This allows us to begin auditing sites despite travel restrictions.,BDX_2021.pdf
"With a shift to virtual audits and a transformation of methodologies to address this new platform, we were able to continue to audit facilities to provide an effective level of governance oversight and address new challenges during these unprecedented times.",BDX_2021.pdf

BD actively assesses supplier compliance with these Expectations as part of our wider process for human rights due diligence in the supply chain.,BDX_2021.pdf
"BD’s human rights due diligence in the supply chain efforts are made up of three key work components—Prioritize, Assess and Mitigate.Human rights due diligence in the supply chain – key accomplishments Across all of our programs that address human rights and modern slavery, we assess management effectiveness through periodic program reviews and have started to implement key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress against our 2030+ goals for responsible supply chain.",BDX_2021.pdf
"As of the end of FY 2021, we completed 160 supplier audits; these represent 15 percent of our total spend, having completed a supplier scorecard.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Of those 160 audits, one high-risk supplier was identified; BD took action to engage with the supplier to better understand the risk and assign corrective actions.",BDX_2021.pdf
In the following months the supplier was reassessed and improved its score.,BDX_2021.pdf
The Responsible Sourcing Operating Committee closely monitored this progress and will continue to evaluate this supplier to ensure ongoing compliance with our Expectations.,BDX_2021.pdf
BD recognizes that establishing our Expectations and building due diligence programs for our supply chain is an important step.,BDX_2021.pdf
We understand that we must also establish training and feedback sessions to continuously improve practice.,BDX_2021.pdf
"To enable this, we have established both internal training and supplier training.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Internally, BD has rolled out our annual Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking training to teach our associates who may interact with a supplier how to identify potential indicators of human rights abuses; we also inform our associates how to report known or suspected abuses.",BDX_2021.pdf
"In FY 2021, nearly 10,000 associates completed this course.",BDX_2021.pdf
"BD has also worked to ensure that auditors from across the company who might visit a supplier manufacturing site (for instance, quality auditors) are equipped to report any information that might have relevance to negative human rights practices.",BDX_2021.pdf
BD also seeks opportunities to train and engage with our suppliers on human rights.,BDX_2021.pdf
We have integrated a training for new suppliers around our Expectations document as part of the supplier on-boarding process.,BDX_2021.pdf
"In April 2022, we hosted training based on our Expectations document for suppliers worldwide—part of our ongoing efforts to continue to emphasize these expectations with our suppliers.",BDX_2021.pdf
"To learn more about our human rights due diligence in the supply chain progress, we encourage you to read our Modern Slavery compliance statements at bd.comIn FY21 we completed 160 supplier audits, representing 15% of our total spend.",BDX_2021.pdf
"PrioritizeWithin our supply chain (where our highest risk of modern slavery and human trafficking exists), suppliers are evaluated internally, in a process outlined by our Supply Base Resiliency Program, and by a third-party tool to understand human rights risk, which includes risk factors identified in the International Labor Organization (ILO)’s “Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights ” at work, such as child labor, forced labor and other workers’ rights.",BDX_2021.pdf
"BD recognizes that our highest-risk suppliers are likely to be found in countries and industries cited for having the highest prevalence of modern slavery, human trafficking and other human rights violations.",BDX_2021.pdf

"We work collaboratively with our suppliers to identify solutions to help them to reduce emissions or introduce innovative, sustainability-focused solutions to the purchases we make.",BDX_2021.pdf
We have equipped our Procurement team with the tools to help them to understand how their choices impact emissions—both Category 1 emissions and those across the company.,BDX_2021.pdf
"Furthermore, our procurement associates actively seek to implement strategies that drive sustainability—both in the impact of our purchased goods and services and in other categories.",BDX_2021.pdf
"For instance, we work toward driving greener fleet usage, which impacts what we buy and also the emissions from those vehicles.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Not only do we seek to buy more sustainable materials, we are strategic about where we buy when possible, focusing on best-country sourcing.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Strategy to reduce emissions As we work to establish a long-term science-based goal with interim targets, we can also work in parallel to achieve reductions.",BDX_2021.pdf

"Internally, we are developing a number of tools for BD associates to better engage with, quantify and understand the carbon impact of their projects.",BDX_2021.pdf
"This is paired with an ongoing effort to educate associates about emissions and the impact of the purchasing decisions they make; it is not just what we buy that impacts our emissions, but also how we buy it.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Externally, we are mapping our suppliers to understand their efforts to reduce their own emissions and collect their emissions data.",BDX_2021.pdf
Those suppliers that demonstrate leading practices will be leveraged to identify potential projects that we can work on collaboratively to further reduce emissions.,BDX_2021.pdf
Suppliers that have not yet measured baselines or set reduction goals will be offered assistance in trainings and mentorships with the aim of moving them toward setting their own science-based targets.,BDX_2021.pdf

The teams listed above report on progress at least annually to the ERC and on specific risks as necessary.112 2021 ESG Report Transparency Appendices Responsible supply chain Product impact Climate change Introduction Healthy workforce and communities Strategy A summary of climate risks and opportunities that could have a substantive impact on our business is outlined below.,BDX_2021.pdf
We define substantive strategic risk as climate-related risks that have more variability and uncertainty over a longer time frame than is normally considered for financial risk.,BDX_2021.pdf
The majority of disclosures in this report fall under the category of substantive strategic risk.,BDX_2021.pdf
"Any risk or opportunity that could result in a change in business operations, revenue or expenditure, thereby prompting disclosure in other company filings (e.g., 10-K) may be considered financially substantive for the purposes of TCFD-recommended and CDP disclosures.",BDX_2021.pdf
"This applies to both supply chain and direct operations.When considering climate-related risks and opportunities, we define the magnitude of potential impact as follows: • Low – insignificant impact on revenues and/or minor disruption of operations.",BDX_2021.pdf
"• Medium – some impact on r evenues and/or some disruption to operations, likely limited to a geographic region and/or number of business units.",BDX_2021.pdf
This may result in disclosure in financial reports.,BDX_2021.pdf
"• High – signific ant impact on revenues and/or severe disruption to operations, likely affecting multiple regions and/or business units.",BDX_2021.pdf
This will likely result in disclosures in financial reports.,BDX_2021.pdf
We consider a short-term horizon to be up to three years in the context of climate-related risks and opportunities.,BDX_2021.pdf
"This is in alignment with other general financial planning and business practices (such as financial planning for energy-efficiency projects).Medium-term time horizons are defined as three to 10 years in alignment with general financial planning and business processes with a medium-term outlook, such as power purchase agreements, which often have terms of around 10 years.",BDX_2021.pdf
Long-term time horizons are aligned with other business practices and long-term goals.,BDX_2021.pdf
"For example, our company’s 2030+ goals with a 2019 baseline and carbon neutrality goals fit into a long-term time horizon.113 2021 ESG Report Transparency Appendices Responsible supply chain Product impact Climate change Introduction Healthy workforce and communities Risks Where the risk occurs in the value chainDirect operations Risk type Acute physical Climate-related driver Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods Potential financial impact Decreased revenues due to reduced production capacity Time horizon Medium-term Likelihood About as likely as not Magnitude of impact Low – medium Description There is evidence to suggest that climate change is already impacting the frequency and severity of tropical storms.",BDX_2021.pdf
The impact of an extreme weather event on healthcare was exemplified by hurricane Maria.,BDX_2021.pdf
"As reported in the results for our first fiscal quarter in 2018, costs of $7 million were incurred as a result of hurricane-related damage to our production facilities in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria.",BDX_2021.pdf
We have manufacturing sites all over the world.,BDX_2021.pdf
"In some instances, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Interruptions to our manufacturing operations resulting from weather or natural disasters, regulatory requirements or issues in our manufacturing process, equipment failure or other factors, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products.",BDX_2021.pdf
"In some instances, we may not be able to transition manufacturing to other BD sites or a third party to replace the lost production.",BDX_2021.pdf
A significant interruption of our manufacturing operations could result in lost revenues and damage to our relationship with customers.,BDX_2021.pdf
"In addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale, and we utilize both BD facilities and third parties for this process.",BDX_2021.pdf
"In some instances, only a few facilities are qualified under applicable regulations to conduct this sterilization.",BDX_2021.pdf
"To the extent we or third parties are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to lack of capacity (e.g., caused by disruption from an extreme weather event), regulatory requirements (e.g., related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions) or otherwise, we may be unable to transition sterilization to other sites or modalities in a timeline- or cost-effective manner, or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Our response Our 2030+ commitments and goals include targets to reduce GHG emissions across our value chain, in addition to a commitment to creating a supply chain that is adaptable to disruption and able to contribute to strong environmental and social performance; this includes a goal to incorporate climate risk into supply chain and network architecture strategies.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Hurricane Maria demonstrated how important it is to continue our work in this area, in order to manage and reduce risk from future extreme-weather-related events around the world.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Risks to our operations, including those caused by potential natural disasters, are identified as part of our Enterprise Risk Management process.",BDX_2021.pdf
Each BD facility that is in an area of risk for natural disasters has a crisis/emergency plan specific to its location.,BDX_2021.pdf
"If needed, we also implement projects that increase or improve our backup systems and resilience to physical extremes.",BDX_2021.pdf
Case study: We are continuously increasing the resilience of our facilities by investing in resilience projects.,BDX_2021.pdf
"For example, a CHP unit in our Drogheda, Ireland, location will reduce reliance on the power grid and increase resilience; by producing our own energy on-site, we are able to continue to operate in situations causing energy outages, such as extreme weather.",BDX_2021.pdf
We are also updating our strategy to incorporate climate-change considerations.,BDX_2021.pdf
BD undertook climate scenario analysis to better understand how climate-related risks (such as climate-induced water scarcity) and opportunities could impact the business.,BDX_2021.pdf
"BD partnered with BSR, a global nonprofit organization of sustainable business experts that works with its global network of the world’s leading companies to build a just and sustainable world, to develop four scenarios corresponding to warming by 2100 that explored climate-related risks and opportunities, and other key uncertainties for BD’s business.",BDX_2021.pdf
These scenarios incorporated credible and publicly available climate projections for emissions reductions and climate impacts.,BDX_2021.pdf
"These scenarios were reviewed by BD’s management in early 2020 and insights from the scenario analysis were incorporated into the development of BD’s 2030+ commitments and goals.114 2021 ESG Report Transparency Appendices Responsible supply chain Product impact Climate change Introduction Healthy workforce and communities Where the risk occurs in the value chainDirect operations Risk type Emerging regulation Climate-related driver Carbon-pricing mechanisms Potential financial impact Increased indirect (operating) costs Time horizon Medium-term Likelihood Exceptionally unlikely Magnitude of impact Low Description Our operations are global and are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to various areas, including environmental protection.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Violation of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and, in some cases, exclusion from participation in healthcare programs.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emissions of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate the closures of or changes to our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability for BD.",BDX_2021.pdf
The enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations.,BDX_2021.pdf
"Additionally, new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy and transportation costs, as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components.",BDX_2021.pdf
"In particular, we purchase supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products, and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results.",BDX_2021.pdf
Increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs.,BDX_2021.pdf
We may not be able to offset any increases in our operational costs.,BDX_2021.pdf
"Local and national governments may implement taxes on fuel and energy to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and these taxes may increase over time in the areas where BD operates.",BDX_2021.pdf

"Time horizons covered by financial planning are short- to medium-term.Risks and opportunities from climate change in asset financial planning are impacted for some suppliers, facilities and product lines.",BDX_2021.pdf
Risks include property damage from acute physical impacts from increased severity of extreme weather events—as seen through Hurricane Maria.,BDX_2021.pdf
These risks are managed as part of general business continuity planning over the medium-term.,BDX_2021.pdf
Case study of substantial strategic decisions: BD has entered into multiple power purchase agreements (PPAs) at various facilities to secure a supply of renewable energy for our operations.,BDX_2021.pdf
These PPAs range from on-site renewable energy installations to indirect procurement of green energy off-site.,BDX_2021.pdf
"By signing these agreements and fixing our energy costs over a long period of time, we are managing our operating costs as well as reducing climate impacts.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Time horizons covered by financial planning are short- to medium-term.125 2021 ESG Report Transparency Appendices Responsible supply chain Product impact Climate change Introduction Healthy workforce and communities Scenario analysis In 2019, responding to the need for strategic resilience in a time of rapid change, as well as a desire to assess and report to investors on climate risk in line with the TCFD Recommendations, BD undertook climate scenario analysis to better understand how climate-related risks and opportunities could impact the business.",BDX_2021.pdf
"BD partnered with BSR, a global nonprofit organization of sustainable business experts that works with its global network of the world’s leading companies to build a just and sustainable world.",BDX_2021.pdf
"BSR and BD collaboratively developed qualitative scenarios, augmented them with information from relevant climate projections and completed a climate scenario to analyze and assess the resilience of BD’s corporate strategy to climate-related risks and opportunities, in line with the TCFD Recommendations.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Four scenarios were developed that corresponded to warming by 2100 allowing us to explore climate-related risks and opportunities, and other key uncertainties for our business.",BDX_2021.pdf
The time horizons covered included both the medium and the long-term (2030+).,BDX_2021.pdf
"In order to incorporate information from climate projections into the scenarios, specific temperature increases and climate projections were assigned to each scenario.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Two of the resulting scenarios were created based on the RCP 2.6 scenarios with the 1.5°C trajectory by 2100; the remaining two were created based on RCP 8.5, which is also the business-as-usual scenario.",BDX_2021.pdf
"The areas that were considered as part of the scenario analysis include supply chain, business strategy, policy, market trends and technology.",BDX_2021.pdf
"A cross-functional workshop was held, in order for participants to explore the strategic implications of the four future scenarios.",BDX_2021.pdf
"The results were used to determine (1) issues that are likely to increase in importance, regardless of scenario, and (2) highly dynamic issues that are very responsive to different scenarios and therefore require close monitoring and a foresight-driven management approach.",BDX_2021.pdf
"These insights were incorporated into the development of BD’s 2030+ commitments and goals, including the science-based target that was announced at the end of 2020.Under the business-as-usual scenarios, a number of issues increased in importance, including water and global systemic health challenges related to climate change.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Under the remaining scenarios with the 1.5°C trajectory by 2100, energy and emissions from our operations; social impact and access for underserved populations; talent; diversity and inclusion; and global systemic health challenges related to climate change increased in importance.",BDX_2021.pdf
These issues are addressed under our 2030+ commitments.,BDX_2021.pdf
Further information about which of our ESG issues increased in importance and/or were dynamic can be found in the material ESG issues section.,BDX_2021.pdf
"Risk management At a company level, climate-related risks are identified by the central S&EHS team.",BDX_2021.pdf
"The process for identifying risks involves stakeholder engagement with our internal technical experts, customers, shareholders, BD associates, business partners (e.g., suppliers), communities, governments, international agencies and nongovernmental organizations.",BDX_2021.pdf
Climate-related risks are identified and evaluated by the S&EHS team through general sustainability materiality assessments and are informed by our ERM program and business continuity planning in areas such as disaster planning (including severe storms).,BDX_2021.pdf
Physical (operational) risks posed by climate change that could impact our direct operations and/or supply chain and result in disruption to business continuity are identified and evaluated via processes established within the ISC team.,BDX_2021.pdf
"Risk teams within the ISC team partner with individual facilities, business teams and subject matter experts to identify and evaluate risks (which may include but are not confined to climate change impacts).",BDX_2021.pdf
The central Risk Management team is responsible for monitoring compliance to property protection standards through which longer-term systematic risks can be evaluated.,BDX_2021.pdf
"The process includes, but is not limited to, aggregation of insurance reports, sustainability risk assessments and third-party tools, such as water risk assessments.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Examples of these physical risks include damage to facility and/or product from severe weather (such as Hurricane Maria’s impact on our facilities in Puerto Rico) and upstream fluctuations in the availability of materials (such as hurricanes in Texas impacting refineries and, by extension, resins.).",BDX_2021.pdf
"Transitional risks posed by climate change (financial, external, legal and compliance, and strategic) are evaluated by the central S&EHS team.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Both physical and transitional risks posed by climate change may also be reviewed within the ERM program, based on risk assessment and other procedures performed to identify and assess risks against established guidelines.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Though risks that are identified as part of our ERM program may be impacted by climate change (for example, supply chain disruption due to extreme weather), climate change may not be named as a specific individual risk.",BDX_2021.pdf
Any climate-related risks that may be captured within our ERM program will be managed in accordance with the ERM program governance.,BDX_2021.pdf
"For further information regarding management and Board oversight or our ERM program, please refer to the ESG Governance section.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Once risks and opportunities from climate change have been identified, they are evaluated and prioritized by the central S&EHS team.",BDX_2021.pdf
"This includes assessing key risk areas, evaluating the likelihood and impact, and ranking these risks.",BDX_2021.pdf
"Key prioritization components include the magnitude of the event should it occur (financial or reputational), the probability of such an event happening and our direct control to mitigate the risk.",BDX_2021.pdf
Climate-related risks (including GHG emissions and water scarcity) were also identified by the central S&EHS team as risks to the company as a part of the ESG issue materiality assessments.,BDX_2021.pdf

"Externally, progress is shared via our sustainability reporting (including annual reporting to the CDP).",BDX_2021.pdf
"External reporting is carried out to meet growing stakeholder expectation for transparency, and therefore it helps to manage any reputational risk.",BDX_2021.pdf
BD has also developed a best-in-class Supply Base Resiliency program that evaluates supplier risk against 14 different risk factors.,BDX_2021.pdf
"These factors include environmental risk (supplier practice and policy to account for their own climate-based risks and greenhouse gas emissions), location risk (including indicators such as a country’s reliance on fossil fuels and the emission of carbon dioxide), which accounts for hazardous environments/locations potentially caused by climate change and may also impact supplier operations, and geopolitical risk, which can account for potential risk brought on by environmental/sustainability policy (or lack thereof).",BDX_2021.pdf
"Suppliers included in this risk program are evaluated based on risk criteria and, if the risk rating is high, asked to develop an improvement plan to better account for that risk.",BDX_2021.pdf
Metrics and targets Details of our metrics and targets can be found in the Climate Change section.,BDX_2021.pdf
