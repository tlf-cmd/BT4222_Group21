"With a 64-year heritage, we rigorously innovate to improve the health of animals and benefit our customers, while fostering an inclusive, cause-driven culture for more than 5,800 employees.",,,
"At Elanco, we understand the powerful role healthy animals play in making life better.",,,

"Until September 20, 2018 Elanco was a subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company.",,,
Lilly is a global healthcare leader that unites caring with discovery to create medicines that make life better for people around the world.,,,
"We were founded more than a century ago by a man committed to creating high-quality medicines that meet real needs, and today we remain true to that mission in all our work.",,,
"Across the globe, Lilly employees work to discover and bring life-changing medicines to those who need them, improve the understanding and management of disease, and give back to communities through philanthropy and volunteerism.",,,
"To learn more about Lilly, please visit us at www.lilly.com and http://newsroom.lilly.com/social-channels .ABOUT ELI LILLY AND COMPANY ABOUT ELANCO ANIMAL HEALTHINTRO | PAGE 4A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO DELIVERING VALUE AND REDUCING COSTS In 2018, the company separated our Elanco Animal Health subsidiary with an initial public offering and divestiture.",,,
"This transaction allows Lilly to focus exclusively on human medicines—discovering, developing, manufacturing and reaching patients with new therapies for serious health conditions.",,,
"In the past five years, we have launched 10 new medicines—halfway to our goal of 20 new molecules by 2023.",,,
"The initially promising results of one of those medicines, Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma, were not confirmed in later clinical trials—a risk inherent in the scientific process.",,,
So Lilly worked quickly with regulators to develop a plan to withdraw Lartruvo from the market while allowing current patients to continue receiving therapy.,,,
Growing numbers of people are benefiting from Lilly’s medicines around the world.,,,
"Still, we recognize that the cost of medicines is a concern for many, and sometimes an obstacle to people getting treatment.",,,
"That’s why Lilly has a long-standing policy of not seeking or enforcing patents for medicines in any of the “least developed countries,” as defined by the United Nations.",,,
It’s also why we’re working with others in the U.S. healthcare system to make sure patients can get the medicines they need—at reasonable out-of-pocket costs and with pricing information they can understand.,,,
"In 2018, Lilly opened the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center to assist people who need help paying for their Lilly insulin.",,,
"We also launched Insulin Lispro, an authorized generic insulin, at a list price 50 percent lower than our branded insulin, Humalog.",,,
"We know there’s more to do, and we are committed to working with others across healthcare systems to advocate for policies that expand access to medicines while rewarding innovation.",,,
"FOSTERING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION To support our strategy of innovation, we must have a culture of diversity and inclusion (D&I)—one in which everyone can bring diverse ideas, perspectives, and experiences to bear in the pursuit of our purpose.",,,
We’ve taken a research-based approach—modeled after the research we conduct to understand our own patient populations.,,,
"This research has helped us better understand the experiences, unmet needs, and career tensions of our employees, especially women and minorities, and informed companywide D&I programs.",,,
"From the end of 2016 to the end of 2018, we increased the number of women in management globally to 42 percent, our initial aspirational goal.",,,
"We also increased racial and ethnic minority representation in management in the United States, to 21 percent of total management.",,,
"This year, we set even higher aspirational goals for women and minorities in management.",,,
"In early 2019, DAVID A. RICKS Chairman and CEO Dear Stakeholders, At Eli Lilly and Company, our purpose is to unite caring with discovery to create medicines that make life better for people around the world.",,,
Core to our purpose is our commitment to aid human suffering—independent of an individual’s or nation’s economic status—and to conduct our business in a responsible way for the long term.,,,
"As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2009, Lilly is pleased to reaffirm our commitment to the responsible business principles represented by the Global Compact, as well as our commitment to work toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals .INTRO | PAGE 5we were proud that our research-based approach was recognized with the prestigious Catalyst Award—one of four companies to receive this honor this year—reflecting our D&I focus.",,,
ADVANCING GLOBAL AND LOCAL HEALTH Advances in healthcare have helped billions live longer lives.,,,
"But in too many places around the world, due to insufficient development of healthcare systems, these innovations are out of reach.",,,
Lilly has set a goal to create new access to quality health care in resource- limited settings for 30 million people every year by 2030.,,,
We call this Lilly 30x30.,,,
It focuses on three areas: 1) Partnerships—working with others to strengthen health systems; 2) Programs—enhancing access to Lilly medicines; and 3) Pipeline—finding molecules for diseases that disproportionately affect people in resource-limited settings.,,,
"In 2018, Lilly continued to expand our partnership with AMPATH, a medical consortium making an incredible difference in the lives of patients in western Kenya who are in desperate need.",,,
"Since 2002, we have committed nearly $150 million in product donations to AMPATH, helping to dramatically reduce what were once frequent shortages of medicine.",,,
The Lilly Foundation has committed an additional $3.5 million to help AMPATH expand its breast and cervical cancer screenings— including mobile outreach for rural areas.,,,
"As of September 2018, they had reached 35,000 people.",,,
"In 2018, building on what we’ve learned from global health programs, we gathered with local partners to launch a program addressing health disparities in our own hometown of Indianapolis.",,,
The result is a neighborhood-based approach designed to help address the high incidence of diabetes in three Indianapolis communities—where life expectancy can be 14 years lower than in neighborhoods just 10 miles away.,,,
"The $7 million, five-year pilot program features newly hired community healthcare workers who help identify people with diabetes and connect them with quality care.",,,
"In the next few years, we will focus even more on the areas of programs and pipeline to increase our impact.",,,
MANAGING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS Lilly is committed to continually reducing our environmental footprint and to publicly reporting progress toward our goals.,,,
"In 2018, Lilly received a CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) score of A- on climate change, which is considered leadership level, and we received a B on water stewardship.",,,
"As of the end of 2018, we met and even exceeded two of our 2020 goals: achieving a 20 percent improvement in our waste efficiency, and a 15 percent reduction in phosphorous emissions in wastewater.",,,
"By 2020, we will transition 90 percent of our endotoxin tests—a mandatory quality test for pharmaceuticals and medical devices—from a process which relies on bleeding horseshoe crabs, to a synthetic compound.",,,
"This new method, which Lilly helped to validate, is equally effective, more efficient, and cost-effective—and it doesn’t require harvesting live animals.",,,
"Transitioning our testing will lessen our impacts on the wild crab population, reducing our dependence on an increasingly at-risk species that is a vital part of many food webs, including for endangered and threatened birds.",,,
"DAVID A. RICKS Chairman and CEOEvery day, Lilly’s team of 33,000 employees strives to operate our company according to our values of integrity, excellence, and respect for people.",,,
"While pleased with our performance, we are not satisfied.",,,
We are compelled to improve .,,,
"Thank you for your interest in our company.INTRO | PAGE 6Lilly has a long, proud heritage of strengthening the communities where we work and live.",,,
"We do this through giving, volunteering, and focusing on the issues that tie back to our business: health and education.",,,
"We actively encourage our employees to volunteer—in their backyards as well as around the world—and give back in ways that are personally meaningful to them.2018 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY HIGHLIGHTS IMPROVING LIVES AND STRENGTHENING COMMUNITIES Connecting Hearts Abroad More than 1,000 Lilly employees have volunteered through Connecting Hearts Abroad, our global service program.",,,
"Working on health and community projects across Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, volunteers return to Lilly with insights that help us become a better, more globally aware company.",,,
"Global Day of Service In 2018, we celebrated our 11th annual Lilly Global Day of Service, on which Lilly and Elanco employees help neighbors and communities around the world.",,,
"Since the program launched, employees in over 65 countries have given more than 1 million hours and created a lasting legacy by completing thousands of projects— from assembling cancer-care packages for patients to beautifying neighborhoods by planting thousands of trees.",,,
"United Way In 2018, Lilly and United Way celebrated a 100-year relationship dating back to 1918.",,,
"To date, Lilly has raised more than $300 million for United Way.",,,
"In 2018, contributions from Lilly U.S. employees and retirees, plus a matching gift from the Eli Lilly and Company Foundation totaled $13.3 million.TOTAL COMMITTED TO GLOBAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING 2017-2022 $90M 2018 TOTAL PRODUCT DONATIONS $1.3B 2018 TOTAL CASH DONATIONS *including $26M from the Lilly Foundation $30.3M*CONTRIBUTIONS AT A GLANCE INSULIN VIALS DONATED AS OF 2018 TO THE LIFE FOR A CHILD PROGRAM1.8M 2018 TOTAL UNITED WAY CONTRIBUTIONS *including $6.7M from the Lilly Foundation$13.3M NUMBER OF EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEER HOURS THROUGH LILLY GLOBAL DAY OF SERVICE SINCE 20081.1MINTRO | PAGE 7The Lilly Foundation works to improve the lives of those who lack resources, including supporting and championing efforts in our home state of Indiana to strengthen public education focusing on early childhood education, K-12, and STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and math).",,,
"The Foundation backs results- oriented programs and organizations with the proven ability to drive community impact, including: • Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS), which empowers and educates students with diverse backgrounds to think critically, creatively, and responsibly to pursue their dreams with purpose.",,,
"The Lilly Foundation gave $300,000 in grant funding to support professional development, technology investment, and youth employment at IPS’s Advanced Manufacturing, Engineering and Logistics Academy and Construction, Engineering and Design Academy; • The Mind Trust, which strives to provide every Indianapolis student access to a high-quality school that will improve the lives of the students served and create new possibilities for the communities where they are located;• Teach For America, which advances educational excellence and equity in the United States through a network of remarkable and diverse leaders working to expand opportunity and access for all children; • Junior Achievement, which inspires and prepares young people to succeed in a changing global economy.",,,

"As a global pharmaceutical company, our activities cut across a broad range of societal issues: activities such as ensuring the safety and availability of our medicines, promoting global health, and enhancing access to medicines for those who have trouble affording them.",,,
"In this section, we discuss our work in the following areas related to human rights: bioethics; the availability and safety of our products; sourcing in our supply chain; the affordability of medications; and our global health initiatives.",,,
"Further information on our support for labor standards can be found in the Labor section of this report.HUMAN RIGHTS | PAGE 11Lilly has a longstanding commitment to bioethics—which focuses on the ethics of health care, biomedical research, and biomedical public policy—as an integral component of corporate integrity in the pharmaceutical industry.",,,
"In 1999, Lilly became one of the first pharmaceutical companies to establish a standing bioethics committee to systematically identify, evaluate, and communicate bioethics issues, and in 2008 created a bioethics program with dedicated full-time staff.",,,
"We embrace a comprehensive approach to bioethics, providing a variety of resources and educational offerings to help employees navigate ethical scenarios and apply bioethics principles in their daily work.BIOETHICS Governance of Bioethics at Lilly Consolidating the company’s ethics efforts under one tent, in early 2018 Lilly’s bioethics program became housed within the Global Ethics and Compliance organization, reporting to the chief ethics and compliance officer.",,,
This move increases the independence of the bioethics function overall and allows the bioethics team broader focus across all aspects of Lilly’s operations—from research and development to commercialization activities.,,,
"Bioethics team members include full-time, dedicated staff with pharmaceutical industry expertise as well as specialized training in bioethics.",,,
"These individuals serve as valuable internal resources for the company, and are responsible for the program’s development, deliverables, and oversight.",,,
A cross-functional bioethics advisory committee also includes external expertise in bioethics.,,,
Moving Lilly’s bioethics program within our Global Ethics and Compliance organization will continue to elevate this important work and enable greater engagement —beyond just clinical research—with all facets of our enterprise.,,,
This move is part of our ongoing efforts to reflect our commitment to integrity and to engrain ethical decision-making into every phase of our work .,,,
"In doing so, we also become a more efficient operation, helping our colleagues access the tools they need to make better, faster decisions across a range of business issues facing our industry.",,,

Lilly applies a single global standard to the conduct of medical trials involving human subjects.,,,
"This standard is based on well-respected ethics guidance and other requirements including: • The World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki ; • The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences’ International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects ; • The International Conference on Harmonisation’s Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (E6) ; • The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials ; and, • Applicable laws and regulations of the country or countries in which a study is conducted.",,,
"Lilly’s commitment to protecting the rights of research subjects is articulated in two company guidance documents— Principles of Medical Research and Bioethics Framework for Human Biomedical Research—and upheld through company policies, standards, and procedures.",,,
"LILLY’S PRINCIPLES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH The Principles of Medical Research specify Lilly’s standard for conducting, funding, and communicating results from its medical research.",,,
"For more information on how Lilly shares information from clinical trials, see the Transparency section of this report.",,,
LILLY’S BIOETHICS FRAMEWORK Lilly’s Bioethics Framework for Human Biomedical Research provides a bioethics foundation for the company’s biomedical research so that it is aligned with broadly accepted ethics principles and Lilly’s core values.,,,
The framework consists of four basic principles and 13 essential elements for conducting ethical human biomedical research and sits within the context of Lilly’s broader company purpose and values.,,,
It specifies and compiles Lilly’s bioethical responsibilities to multiple stakeholders.,,,
"The framework informs the development of bioethics positions on topics important to pharmaceutical research and development, and it informs advice that the bioethics committee provides.",,,

We recognize that taking the right medication at the right time is a critical piece of a person’s overall health.,,,
"Therefore, ensuring our products are available wherever and whenever patients need them is one of our top priorities.PATIENT SAFETY AND PRODUCT AVAILABILITY Global Patient Safety Beginning with the discovery of a potential new medicine, Lilly’s goal is to ensure that the benefits and risks of the medicines we market are continuously monitored and well understood by regulators, healthcare providers, and patients.",,,
"Lilly’s Global Patient Safety organization— consisting of more than 300 physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals—is dedicated to the continuous collection, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of safety information.",,,
"Even after medications are approved for general use, Lilly continues to collect adverse event reports from around the world.",,,
Lilly enters this information into a company-specific adverse event database to further evaluate the safety of our medications.,,,
New safety findings and emerging concerns are shared openly with regulators and healthcare providers to appropriately manage risks associated with the use of our medicines.,,,
Ensuring Product Availability The mission of Lilly’s global manufacturing team is to provide a reliable supply of high-quality medicines.,,,
"Because Lilly manufactures medicines that people rely upon and that can be critical for health, we know that we have a responsibility to safeguard both the materials needed to manufacture these medicines and the supply chain logistics that help to ensure their availability.",,,
Our manufacturing policy committee oversees the maintenance of Lilly’s inventory of essential raw materials.,,,
"Before they enter the Lilly system, our raw material and component suppliers are evaluated for technical competence, and the ability to provide high- quality, efficacious, and cost-effective raw materials to Lilly.",,,
More information can be found in the Supply Chain section of this report.,,,
"As an additional safeguard, we have mitigation plans in place for our drug product components, including materials critical to manufacturing finished drug products.",,,
"Continuous improvement initiatives in our manufacturing, packaging, and distribution capabilities help to safeguard the supply of Lilly medicines, and allow us to provide safe and effective finished drug products to patients and healthcare providers.",,,
"The introduction of product serialization, first rolled out in the United States in 2018, with ongoing implementation in other countries to follow, adds an additional level of security to our distributed products.HUMAN RIGHTS | PAGE 14At Lilly, our efforts to ensure the safety and integrity of our products begin with the procurement of materials and extend throughout the production process.",,,
"This includes our interactions to promote strong health, safety, and environment (HSE) practices with suppliers who provide us materials for research and development, as well as with the contract manufacturers who help make our medicines and other pharmaceutical products.",,,
It extends to our work to stem the tide of counterfeit medicines and to ensure we comply with governmental efforts around conflict minerals.,,,
"In addition to the topics we discuss in this section, more information on our work around HSE in our supply chain can be found in the HSE section of this report.SUPPLY CHAIN Preventing Counterfeit Medicines Counterfeit medicines have been found in all therapeutic areas in every region of the world.",,,
"Their impact is wide-reaching and potentially deadly, both due to toxic substances sometimes found in the counterfeit medicines, and because they undermine a patient’s confidence in legitimate medicines and the credibility of healthcare providers.",,,
"Lilly’s anti-counterfeiting strategy is composed of three key objectives: • Securing the integrity of Lilly medicines through the legitimate supply channels; • Deterring major counterfeiters of Lilly medicines through targeted investigations, internet monitoring, legal actions; and, • Partnering with governments, non-governmental organizations, and trade associations to raise awareness, and to strengthen, enact, and enforce anti-counterfeiting laws.",,,
"WORKING TO DETER COUNTERFEITERS ONLINE AND IN THE FIELD Patient safety is the foundation of Lilly’s global anti- counterfeiting efforts, and we are engaged in efforts to combat counterfeiters.",,,
"We are a founder and member of the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies , a global coalition of stakeholders with an interest in protecting patient safety and ensuring patients have access to safe and legitimate online pharmacies.",,,
Lilly advocates for protections for patients from the growing number of illegitimate and unsafe online drug sellers.,,,
"Lilly also supports the dedicated domain name “dot-pharmacy,” an initiative of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy that helps patients distinguish safe and legal online pharmacies.",,,
"Lilly cooperates with customs, police, and other law enforcement officials around the world to investigate and prosecute those who make and distribute counterfeit Lilly medicines without regard to the law or patient safety.",,,
SERIALIZATION Serialization is the unique identification of individual packs of medicines to ensure the security of the legitimate supply chain.,,,
"One of Lilly’s major legislative efforts has been to advocate for the establishment of a uniform standard for coding, serializing, and tracking pharmaceutical products.",,,
"Lilly has made considerable investments in its packaging operations, distribution centers, and IT infrastructure to support this initiative, including new technology, which impacts all of our packaging lines around the world.",,,
"These efforts help to ensure that doctors, pharmacists, and patients can be confident in the medicines they prescribe, dispense, and receive.",,,
Lilly believes that it is imperative that legislative efforts and policies around serialization and product traceability follow global standards.,,,
"Non-standard requirements not only increase the implementation costs for manufacturers and trading partners, but also fail to adequately prevent counterfeit products from entering the legitimate supply chain, increasing the potential for patient harm.",,,
"Lilly actively partners with industry groups such as The Alliance for Global Pharmaceutical Serialization (RxGPS), global standards bodies such as GS1, country level groups and think tanks, and regulators HUMAN RIGHTS | PAGE 15in many markets around the world to advocate for global standards to ensure a harmonized approach to product traceability initiatives.",,,
Lilly’s advocacy efforts have created positive and tangible outcomes that we believe enhance patient safety.,,,
"We played a leadership role in China on this issue, influencing a shift from a nonstandard product traceability requirement to a policy that will accommodate global standards.",,,
"In Malaysia and India, Lilly is investing in advocacy to educate and inform regulatory authorities on the importance of adhering to global standards as they evaluate upcoming legislation.",,,
Conflict Minerals Lilly is concerned with the variety of human rights violations that occur throughout the world.,,,
"We are aware that the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the surrounding countries is understood to be financed, in part, by the mining and trade of certain minerals, including tungsten, tantalum, tin, and gold.",,,
We are committed to making every effort to ensure we understand our supply chain and the potential upstream impacts of our supply and purchasing decisions as they relate to the minerals at issue.,,,
"From 2014 to 2019, Lilly filed annual reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to the conflict minerals rule.",,,
"As a part of that reporting process, we examine the raw material content of all of our global commercial products and seek to identify the origin and source of these raw materials.",,,
Our goal is to develop a better understanding of the supply chain and to avoid the inadvertent support of businesses associated with human rights violations.,,,
Lilly’s expectation is that our suppliers will source their materials responsibly and abstain from procuring materials from areas or sources that might promote conflict in the DRC and that our suppliers conduct their own due diligence regarding the source of any materials they provide to us in order to ensure those materials are conflict-free.,,,
We filed our latest conflict minerals disclosure documents with the SEC in May 2019.,,,
Lilly is committed to continue to understand the origin of these materials and will take appropriate action to avoid the inadvertent support of businesses associated with human rights violations.,,,
HUMAN RIGHTS | PAGE 16Our efforts to bring innovative medicines to patients may take different paths depending on the healthcare system unique to a specific region of the world.,,,
"However, we work to ensure our strategy fits with the needs and expectations of a number of different stakeholders, in addition to patients.",,,
"As we evaluate the various stakeholder perspectives, Lilly may take into account the following considerations: • Health system needs and constraints (e.g., advanced technology, quality metrics, budget constraints) • Patient and caregiver needs (e.g., education and support tools) • Regulatory requirements (e.g., the need for ongoing post-market safety or outcomes studies) • Public policy limitations (e.g., price controls) and enablers (e.g., additional research incentives) Lilly works across the healthcare system to find solutions that make medicines more accessible.",,,
This includes innovating beyond the medicines we produce.,,,
The future of the healthcare system depends on how well it works for patients.,,,
"Lilly remains committed to supporting a system that enables people to live longer, healthier, more active lives.Pricing Around the World Lilly sells medicines in approximately 125 countries around the world.",,,
Each country values medications and innovation differently and must balance competing demands for limited resources.,,,
"This includes other healthcare products and services, as well as meeting other social needs such as education or infrastructure.",,,
"At Lilly, we consider country-specific conditions when pricing medicines on a market-by-market basis, to help ensure patients have affordable access to the innovative medications we develop.",,,
We support public policies to meet this same end.,,,
"We strive to price our medicines to enable affordable access for appropriate patients, reflecting the value provided to patients, providers, payers, caregivers, the health system, and society as a whole.",,,
"We define value in clinical, human, and economic terms, and we base our assessment on the results of clinical trials, economic analysis, projected and measured health outcomes, as well as market research.",,,
Lilly is exploring new ways to achieve the right level of pricing in different markets and we advocate for policy changes that help increase access to medicines.,,,
"Value- based and outcomes-based reimbursement models are examples of payment initiatives that offer the ability to Lilly supports expanded access to our medicines around the world—through the policies we promote; in the actions we take to help consumers, communities, and our employees; and by providing greater transparency about how we price our products.",,,
How we price our medicines is not a decision we take lightly or one we make in isolation.,,,
"We consider how a patient can access the medicine, and the impact that access may have across the varying and unique healthcare systems around the world.",,,
We seek to strike the balance between access and sustaining an industry that can continue to build upon the life- changing treatments it has discovered for some of our most serious diseases.,,,
This is one of the most important decisions we make as a company.,,,
"ACCESS TO MEDICINES, AFFORDABILITY, AND TRANSPARENCY HUMAN RIGHTS | PAGE 17Pricing in the United States Lilly continues to work to expand access to medicines in the U.S. healthcare system—by helping consumers, communities, and our employees; by providing greater transparency about how our products are priced; and through the policies we promote.",,,
Pricing our medicines is one of the most important decisions we make as a company.,,,
We strike a balance between access and affordability for patients while sustaining investments in life-changing treatments for some of today’s most serious diseases.,,,
We consider:Lilly sets a list price for our medicines.,,,
"To enable patient access, Lilly pays rebates and other discounts to payers and other supply chain entities.",,,
The final amount that Lilly ultimately realizes after paying these rebates and discounts is sometimes called the net price.,,,
"Across our U.S. product portfolio, Lilly’s average net price after rebates and discounts—the final amount we receive—has fallen from 59 percent in 2014 to 46 percent in 2018.",,,
"The amount of Lilly’s rebates and discounts continues to increase through a combination of factors— including increased market competition, pharmacy benefit managers’ (PBMs’) increased negotiation leverage, and rising mandatory government discounts.",,,
"However, changes in insurance design and the trend toward greater consumer cost-sharing (through high- deductible plans and co-insurance) means a growing number of patients are exposed to medicines’ full retail price at the pharmacy.The unmet needs that medicines can fulfill for patients and caregivers, and how people can affordably access the treatment The benefits of our medicine compared to alternative medicines, where our medicine fits in treating conditions, and existing contracts between payers and our competitors Such as health system changes and policy guidelines The costs of research, development, manufacturing, and support services for customers; business trends and other economic factors; as well as the medicine’s potential market size, patent life, and place within our larger portfolio of medicinesCUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE COMPANY CONSIDERATIONS OTHER EXTERNAL FACTORSAVERAGE LILLY NET PRICE (AS A % OF LIST PRICE) AFTER DISCOUNTS ACROSS THE U.S.",,,

"When countries look at health costs and related outcomes holistically, rather than in budget silos, it is clear that medications deliver substantial benefits in both human and economic terms.",,,
"As a global company, we are particularly aware of the economic circumstances in many developing countries that can make access to medicines difficult.",,,
"In response, Lilly has developed alternative business models, recognizing that the poorest nations should pay less than wealthy nations.",,,
"Lilly also supports efforts to decrease the final price of medicines to patients, such as minimizing taxes of all types and limiting markups applied in the supply chain.",,,
"In addition, Lilly has a long- standing policy of not seeking or enforcing patents for medicines in any of the least developed countries, as defined by the United Nations.HUMAN RIGHTS | PAGE 18COMPARISON OF LILLY LIST AND NET PRICE CHANGES FOR U.S.",,,

"We support improvements to the U.S. healthcare system that appropriately balance patient affordability, market-based competition, and rewarding innovation.",,,
"We advocate for policy changes at the state and federal level to improve patient affordability, such as exempting treatments for chronic diseases from patient deductibles and passing through rebates to patients at the point of sale.",,,
"In this spirit, Lilly implemented a number of solutions in 2018 that support patients and our employees.",,,
"These are positive steps, but we know there is more to do, and that is why we are committed to finding more solutions to lower the out-of-pocket costs for medicine at the pharmacy counter.",,,
"We don’t want anyone to have to pay full list price for their insulin, and many people who do will be able to pay significantly less by calling our helpline.",,,
"Our goal is to ensure that people paying high out-of-pocket costs for Lilly insulins are matched with the best solution available to reduce their financial burden and help ensure they receive the treatment they need .” - MIKE MASON | SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, CONNECTED CARE AND INSULINS“HUMAN RIGHTS | PAGE 19Our Commitment to Addressing Out-of-Pocket Costs in the United States Lilly recognizes that some people may struggle to pay for their medicines.",,,
We are committed to finding solutions to lower out-of-pocket costs and to implement other changes that can help the U.S. health system work better for patients.,,,
"Below are some of the solutions we have unveiled recently: • In August 2018, Lilly opened the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center to assist people who need help paying for their Lilly insulin, including those with lower incomes, the uninsured, and people in the deductible phase of a high-deductible insurance plan.",,,
"More than 10,000 people every month are getting help lowering their out-of-pocket costs to affordable levels through programs like these.",,,
"Lilly also donates to charitable organizations that provide free medicine, including insulin, to patients meeting program eligibility requirements.",,,
"Over the last five years, Lilly has donated more than 5.4 million insulin vials and pens in the United States.",,,
"• In March 2019, Lilly announced we will offer a lower-priced version of our Humalog® insulin called Insulin Lispro.",,,
This authorized generic version—which is identical to Humalog—will be offered at a list price 50 percent lower than the current Humalog list price.,,,
Insulin Lispro could make insulin more affordable for certain Americans asked to pay full retail price—or a large percentage of the retail price—from their own pockets.,,,
"That may include people in high-deductible health insurance plans, the uninsured, and seniors that hit the coverage gap in their Medicare Part D plans.",,,
"For patients with health plans that prefer the current system, Humalog will remain available.",,,
• Lilly is committed to increasing transparency around the price of our medicines.,,,
"In early 2019, television advertisements for our medicines began directing people to a new website, lillypricinginfo.com , that provides the list price, average out-of-pocket costs, and financial assistance information for the medicine advertised.",,,
"The website provides pricing information for Trulicity®, Taltz®, Verzenio®, and Emgality®.",,,
"In 2019, we will begin providing information on this website for our other medicines as well, whether they are advertised on television or not.",,,
• Lilly actively pursues value-based arrangements to link the price of our medicine more directly to patient outcomes.,,,
This approach can transform the healthcare system to one that is about value versus the volume of medicines purchased.,,,
We continue to advocate for legislative and regulatory changes that support this transition.,,,
LEADING BY EXAMPLE: REDUCING COSTS AND IMPROVING HEALTH FOR EMPLOYEES AT LILLY Employers can play a key role in patient access and affordability by offering benefits that help reduce employee medical costs.,,,
Lilly’s benefits align with this approach.,,,
"Lilly applies prescription drug rebates at the point of sale to help our employees, retirees, and their families with out-of-pocket medicine costs.",,,
"Last year, more than 11,000 Lilly employees, retirees, and their families benefited from these point-of-sale rebates, reducing their costs by approximately $3 million.",,,
We also use rebates to reduce the cost of medical coverage premiums.,,,
We exempt preventive and chronic disease medications from the deductible of our employees’ health plans to ensure there are no barriers for accessing medicines critical to their overall health and well-being.,,,
"Starting in 2019, Lilly will begin providing our eligible employees and their family members living with diabetes a free connected glucose meter and related supplies, along with real-time support from trained diabetes educators.HUMAN RIGHTS | PAGE 20LILLY DIABETES SOLUTION CENTER HELPS WITH INSULIN AFFORDABILITY In 2018, the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center —a new patient-focused helpline—opened to help identify ways patients can access the Lilly insulin they need.",,,
"Staffed with representatives who take a personalized approach, the confidential helpline is available to residents throughout the United States and all U.S. territories, and features representatives who speak English, Spanish, and several other languages.",,,
People in the United States can reach the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center by calling 1-833- 808-1234.,,,
"As of early 2019, more than 10,000 people each month received help through the center.",,,
"In March 2019, Lilly announced a lower-priced version of Humalog called Insulin Lispro.",,,
This authorized generic version—which is identical to Humalog—is offered at a list price 50 percent lower than the current Humalog list price.,,,
The center is offering a suite of solutions—some of which are being offered for the first time—that can significantly lower and cap high monthly out-of-pocket costs for some people who use Lilly insulins.,,,
"Dedicated representatives will review the personal circumstances and identify options for people who pay near the full list price, such as the uninsured and people in the deductible phase of their high-deductible insurance plans, as well as potential solutions for people with lower incomes.",,,
"The following solutions are available through the helpline: Point-of-Sale Savings Helpline representatives can advise callers who face the highest out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy, such as people who are uninsured and people in the deductible phase of their high-deductible commercial insurance plans.",,,
The amount of cost reduction varies person-to- person based upon individual circumstances.,,,
"Out-of- pocket costs for people who use traditional co-pay or co-insurance plans will continue to be set by their health insurer, and federal regulations prevent people who use Medicare Part D or other federal programs from obtaining additional point-of-sale savings.",,,
"Free Clinics Lilly is donating insulin to three relief agencies— Americares, Direct Relief, and Dispensary of Hope—to supply nearly 150 free clinics across the United States with Lilly insulin.",,,
Helpline representatives point people toward clinics that are most convenient to them and provide information about how to obtain insulin at those locations.,,,
Lilly is working with these relief agencies to identify as many clinics as possible that can adequately store and distribute insulin to people who need it.,,,
"Immediate Needs for Insulin If someone has an immediate need for insulin, they can also call the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center to learn about immediate as well as longer-term options.HUMAN RIGHTS | PAGE 21Lilly 30 x30 To accelerate our global health efforts, we established Lilly 30x30—a bold goal to increase access to quality health care in communities with limited resources for 30 million people on an annual basis by 2030.",,,

The growing partnership has played an important role in helping AMPATH build Kenya’s first system of sustainable care for the communities it serves—services that would otherwise be out of reach for the many people there who live on less than $1 a day.,,,
"In 2018, Lilly donated nearly $24 million in medicines to AMPATH.",,,
"AMPATH, which stands for Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare, was created in 2001 in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in western Kenya.",,,
"AMPATH is built on a partnership with Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital and the Moi University School of Medicine in Eldoret, Kenya, and a consortium of North American academic health centers, led by Indiana University.",,,
"AMPATH has continually expanded its successful approach in treating HIV/ AIDS (including diagnosis, treatment, and patient support) to more diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and cancer.",,,
"Today, AMPATH serves a population of more than 8 million people in Kenya at more than 500 clinical sites—from village health centers and dispensaries, to county hospitals, to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, where the organization is headquartered.",,,
"To date, AMPATH has trained 2,600 Kenyan medical professional and community health workers, building local knowledge and service capacity.",,,
"Support and funding from Lilly and the Lilly Foundation—along with numerous other organizations and individuals—are allowing AMPATH to screen, treat, and provide palliative care to more people than ever before.",,,
"Part of this vital support is directed to AMPATH’s Oncology Institute, which opened in 2009 with a single physician and nurse offering services in a tent in an alley behind AMPATH’s main building.",,,
"Public-private partnerships, including Lilly’s support with a $1 million training-and-education grant over four years, have allowed the institute to expand into a permanent facility, including 14 additional clinics and numerous oncology-trained clinicians.",,,
"In 2018, the institute received more than 10,000 patient visits.",,,
"But demand far outstrips supply: the institute is one of only two cancer centers in Kenya, meaning that nearly half of the country’s 49 million people must rely on it for screening and care.",,,
"To help address this gap, the Lilly Foundation committed an additional $3.5 million, from 2016 through 2021, to fund breast and cervical cancer screenings.",,,
"The screenings include mobile outreach for rural areas, and had reached 35,000 people as of September 2018.",,,
Lilly also sends employees to volunteer with AMPATH through the company’s Connecting Hearts Abroad program.,,,
Employees help support AMPATH’s mobile screening efforts that reach people like Nancy Odari .,,,
"Since 2002, Lilly has committed nearly $150 million in product donations to AMPATH, helping to dramatically reduce what were once frequent shortages of medicines that resulted in people being turned away from clinics.",,,
"Within the health system, AMPATH and Lilly have worked with the Kenyan government to develop innovative solutions to improve the overall donation process, minimize delays, and improve the availability of much- needed medicines.",,,
This includes the creation of a novel system which helps ensure that donated medicines will be available on a sustainable basis after government supplies are depleted.,,,
"The model was first used for Lilly insulin, and helped to improve the availability of the medicine from 30 percent to 90 percent in western Kenya.",,,
"This subsidized, but incentivized, pharmacy model has since been expanded to include most essential medicines, with similarly strong results.",,,

"Lead partner, the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), is joined by the Eskenazi Health system, the Marion County Public Health Department, and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) Indianapolis.",,,
"The data-driven, $7 million, five-year program builds on similar approaches used throughout the world, including initiatives that Lilly and its partners have supported in Mexico, India, and South Africa.",,,
"The pilot focuses on three Indianapolis neighborhoods with significant health disparities and high rates of diabetes: the Coalition of Northeast Neighborhoods, Northwest Neighborhood, and Near Westside Neighborhood.",,,
Life expectancy in these three communities can be 14 years lower than in neighborhoods just 10 miles away.,,,
The lower life expectancy rate is largely due to health disparities and is similar to rates seen in countries such as Iraq and Bangladesh.,,,
The Indianapolis pilot will target both those with diabetes and those at high risk for developing the disease.,,,
"In the three target neighborhoods, an estimated 10,000 people already live with diabetes, with prevalence rates as high as 17.5 percent.",,,
"By comparison, the diabetes prevalence rates in nearby communities in Indianapolis is as low as 5 percent.",,,
The pilot is powered by newly-hired community healthcare workers to help identify people with diabetes and connect them with quality care.,,,
"In addition, community members will help identify and propose solutions for the cultural, social, environmental, economic, and policy barriers that increase the risk for diabetes, such as the lack of healthy food options and public spaces for exercise.",,,
"The pilot uses Lilly’s global health framework, which includes studying key research questions, reporting what works and what doesn’t, and then using the data to advocate for the scale-up of the most effective solutions.",,,
"The program will contribute to Lilly 30x30, the company’s goal to create new access to quality health care for 30 million people in underserved communities on an annual basis by 2030.",,,
It also directly supports the 2018 Indiana government drive to require the development of a statewide strategic action plan to significantly reduce the prevalence of diabetes.,,,
Lilly and its partners are testing the hypothesis that the implementation of a multi-pronged community health model will reduce complications for those with diabetes and reduce risk factors for those considered at high risk for developing the disease.,,,
"Specifically, the pilot aims to: • Increase screening requests by those at high risk for diabetes; • Improve access and continuity of care for people with diabetes; and, • Foster a physical and social environment that supports diabetes control and prevention, such as better access to healthy food and exercise options.",,,

"Outreach services are critical in the post- hurricane context, as the storm significantly disrupted access to many healthcare services and referral networks.",,,
"Even prior to the hurricane, the burden of chronic diseases among adults in Puerto Rico was exceptionally high.",,,
Approximately 40 percent of adults are hypertensive and nearly 16 percent have diabetes.,,,
"When it struck, Hurricane Maria exposed preexisting challenges in Puerto Rico—and created new ones—further limiting access to quality healthcare services, medications, healthy food, and clean drinking water in an already overburdened public sector.",,,
"For those on the island living with diabetes, or at risk for the disease, the effects of Hurricane Maria have complicated their ability to get access to adequate care and treatment, as well as vital self-management programs.",,,
Patients who are able to acquire insulin—which requires refrigeration—face ongoing storage challenges due to a persistent lack of reliable power.,,,
"Although maintaining a healthy diet is a critical component of successfully managing diabetes, as well as hypertension, many in Puerto Rico are routinely without access to fresh fruits and vegetables.",,,
"In response, Lilly designed its program to address challenges at multiple levels, supporting those in need of immediate help, as well as working alongside local partners to strengthen the healthcare system overall.",,,

SHIFTING OUR CULTURE LABOR | PAGE 31Freedom of Association and Right to Collective Bargaining Lilly recognizes the importance of freedom of association in the workplace and respects the right of our employees to join associations of their own choosing.,,,
We interact with works councils and unions in several countries; we support these bodies and work productively with them.,,,
The vast majority of our workers globally are not covered under traditional collective-bargaining agreements.,,,
"In some countries where we operate, governments mandate working conditions, such as salary increases, minimum wages, bonuses, number of weekly working hours, vacation time, and overtime rates.",,,
"These vary by country, and we follow these mandates wherever they are required.",,,
"Several of our affiliates have employee councils that meet regularly with management to discuss workforce- related issues that directly impact them, such as company policies and organizational changes.",,,
"As laws and guidelines change wherever we operate, we will continue to work with employees, advocacy groups, and governing bodies to maintain compliance and respect the right of free association.Forced and Child Labor Lilly maintains a long-standing practice of complying with local minimum-age laws and requirements and does not employ child labor, or forced or compulsory labor, in any of our facilities globally.",,,
"In 2011, Lilly revised our global standards and procedures to include specific language about human rights, including our expectation that vendors to Lilly abide by Lilly’s human rights standards as one piece of our Supplier Code of Conduct .The UN Global Compact’s principles state, in part, that both adults and children should be free from compulsory or coerced labor, and that people should have the right to associate freely and bargain collectively.",,,
Lilly fully supports these standards that are upheld in U.S. law.,,,
"LILLY’S SUPPORT OF LABOR STANDARDS LABOR | PAGE 32At Lilly, we support a culture of well-being by providing competitive pay, comprehensive employee benefit programs, training and development resources, and opportunities for employees to serve in their communities and around the world.",,,

"We’re inspired to make a difference in people’s lives every day—through the discovery of life-changing medicines, better understanding of disease management, and support for people living with illness.",,,
We do this with a commitment to diversity and inclusion because we recognize that every individual is unique.,,,
"This perspective helps us to attract and retain the best talent from around the world—people from all backgrounds, who can understand the perspectives of our diverse customers.",,,
Our efforts to build a more diverse and inclusive workforce at Lilly have gained momentum since we began a research initiative to better understand the lived experiences of women and minorities at Lilly.,,,
The research program called Employee Journeys resulted in a subsequent set of programs known as our People Strategy.,,,
"In recognition of this work, we recently won the 2019 Catalyst Award—a prestigious global honor that evaluates companies’ recruitment, development, and advancement initiatives with a focus on proven, measurable results that benefit women across a range of dimensions—including race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, nationality, and disability.",,,
"After a rigorous examination of initiatives, Catalyst, a global nonprofit, conducts intensive on-site evaluations to hear from leaders and employees across the company about their experiences.",,,
"DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION: A KEY ELEMENT OF OUR CULTURE About the Employee Journeys: Listening and Learning Beginning in 2015, we took the research process we use to understand patients and turned it inward to better understand the lived experiences, or journeys, of our employees: the enablers and barriers they experience in their careers.",,,
"This qualitative and quantitative research— first focusing on women and then focusing on African Americans, Asians, and Latinos—yielded themes we called “moments of truth.” This research revealed that cultural and gender differences were affecting the way some employees reported being seen and heard—or not.",,,
"Many women, for example, reported experiencing something called “imposter syndrome”—secretly feeling as though their qualifications weren’t enough.",,,
Issues of authenticity were raised—where some minorities and women reported feeling pressure to act in ways that don’t reflect their own unique perspectives.,,,
"Women of color, especially, said they sometimes felt invisible.",,,
"We shared the results with all Lilly employees, developing a common language to help colleagues more easily relate to and understand one another’s individual and cultural experiences and perceptions.",,,
"The result has been a strong, companywide network of D&I champions, and a new appreciation of the value of different perspectives.",,,
LABOR | PAGE 35People Strategy: Taking Action Building a more inclusive culture doesn’t happen by itself.,,,
It requires focus and action.,,,
"To that end, in 2017 and 2018, we created and implemented a set of initiatives called the People Strategy to address what we found in our research, and to further embed D&I into our internal talent systems and processes.",,,
We undertook and expanded several significant D&I strategies in 2018: • We continued our Employee Journey research and analysis to understand the diverse experiences of our employees.,,,
• We reviewed our talent management programs through the lens of D&I to assess and address hidden biases while ensuring greater transparency about requirements for career development and advancement.,,,
"• Knowing that D&I starts with representation across our workforce, we set aspirational recruiting goals for women globally and minorities in the United States.",,,
"Through 2018, we exceeded both goals and reset guidance for 2019 in line with labor pool availability.",,,
"• For management roles across the enterprise, we held ourselves accountable for progress by setting aspirational goals to increase representation for women globally and minorities in the United States.",,,
"• Between early 2017 and the end of 2018, the total number of women in management grew, increasing our overall representation of women in these roles to 42 percent, meeting our goal.",,,
And the number of women on our Executive Committee—leaders who report directly to the CEO—climbed from 29 percent to 43 percent over that time.,,,
We also met our goals for increasing the percentage of minorities in management.,,,
We are currently re-evaluating to set new goals.,,,
It’s important to note that these aren’t quotas.,,,
We are making progress by focusing on developing talented people from all backgrounds to further their careers.,,,
"For every open position at Lilly, we require a diverse pool of candidates and a diverse set of interviewers.",,,
This helps us ensure that leaders look beyond their own comfort zone for the most qualified candidate available for each open role.,,,
"We also established new expectations for managers to lead more inclusively by valuing differences, recognizing and overcoming bias, and fostering a speak-up culture.",,,
Our performance management process and Pulse survey to gauge employee feedback are measurements we use to hold our leaders accountable.,,,
"We’ve expanded training programs for leaders globally, to help them develop skills to support conscious inclusion and psychological safety.",,,
Several thousand leaders have participated in one or both of these programs so far.,,,
We’ve also begun a new cultural literacy program for all employees.,,,
Top leaders have long sponsored employees who have the aspiration and the ability to lead at Lilly in the future.,,,
"This sponsorship initiative has been expanded to involve more senior leaders with high-potential employees from majority and minority groups with key talents, to help guide and support their careers.",,,
External Efforts Our commitment to diversity goes beyond our employees.,,,
We maintain a presence at top colleges and universities and work with a wide range of professional associations to recruit a diverse workforce.,,,
We also attract top talent through an extensive global MBA internship program.,,,
"We partner with advocacy groups, professional societies, community organizations, public and private healthcare administrators, and others to help reduce health disparities and to address the unique healthcare needs of all communities.",,,
"Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends through the full spectrum of our business, including our clinical trial strategies and our supply chain.By understanding our employees’ journeys, we’re paving the way for more inclusion and career growth for everyone —and more innovation for our patients.",,,
And we’ve just begun.,,,
” - DAVE RICKS | LILLY CHAIRMAN AND CEO“LABOR | PAGE 36Global Impact We understand that diversity means different things around the globe.,,,
Our leadership teams formulate their diversity strategies by considering our corporate perspective and then customizing their own plans based on local demographics and culture.,,,
"For example, some build plans that are related to gender, provincial, generational, and/or disability diversity.",,,
Lilly’s senior vice president for human resources and diversity reports directly to our chairman and CEO.,,,
"And our Code of Business Conduct, The Red Book , also summarizes our approach to creating an inclusive, nondiscriminatory environment.",,,
"Employee Resource Groups One key element of our inclusive culture is our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which help us connect with the diversity of our patients and customers around the world.",,,
"In 2018, the ERGs that represent our Latino, African American, and Asian employees played key leadership roles in our Employee Journeys.",,,
"In recent years, Lilly’s ERGs have been expanding into areas with a more direct business impact, becoming even more central to our company’s success.",,,
"For example, our ERGs frequently consult on marketing and workplace programs.",,,
They also assist with corporate executive training programs on topics such as cultural awareness and inclusion.,,,
"When colleagues from other backgrounds are preparing for global assignments, ERG members help them understand the customs and culture of their destination country.",,,
"Lilly ERGs also participate in recruiting events at universities and career fairs to help us attract diverse prospective employees, fellows, and interns.",,,
"ERGs include members representing all levels of the company, and each ERG has a senior leader as an executive sponsor, someone who takes an active role in ERG events and activities.",,,
"This means that ERG members have interactions with leaders they might otherwise never meet, which offers opportunities for informal or formal mentoring relationships.",,,
"At Lilly, ERGs support an inclusive workplace environment by: • Creating cross-cultural learning opportunities • Providing networking and cultural support among employees with common backgrounds or interests • Offering experiences for employees from diverse backgrounds to build leadership skills About 14,600 Lilly employees are members of at least one of our 11 ERGs, which include more than 75 chapters located at Lilly offices, research sites, and manufacturing operations around the world.2018 RECOGNITION CATALYST: 2019 Catalyst Award Recipient JUST CAPITAL: America’s Most Just Companies, No.",,,

"• Management System Standard: Defines requirements to ensure a robust process is in place within each part of the organization to effectively manage compliance with Lilly HSE standards, applicable regulatory requirements, and other external HSE standards to which we commit.",,,
• Environmental Standard: Provides more detailed requirements and establishes the core governance requirements to manage the environmental and energy-related aspects of our operations.,,,
• Health and Safety and Process Safety Standards: Provide requirements for identifying and evaluating workplace hazards and establishing control measures to eliminate or reduce the risk of injuries and illnesses.,,,
"• Global Engineering Standards: Establish requirements for the design and operation of facilities and equipment, to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements, and responsibly manage environmental aspects of operations.",,,
"• Product Stewardship Standard: Provides a systematic approach to managing product and process risks throughout the product life cycle, from research and discovery to product end-of-life.",,,
"Management Systems Our Management System Standard requires that all business areas, including manufacturing, research and development, affiliate locations, and general administrative offices, adhere to an HSE management system that is consistent with third-party standards such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001, Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001, and the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care Management System (RCMS®) standards.",,,
"Our global HSE management system is periodically reviewed by an independent, accredited auditor to ensure it conforms to the RCMS.Audits We conduct audits of Lilly sites following protocols for each of our Global HSE Standards as well as regulatory requirements.",,,
"Our five-year audit plan is updated annually and identifies which sites to audit based on risk, with sites associated with high-risk operations being audited more frequently.",,,
This results in annual audits of approximately 25 to 30 percent of our sites globally.,,,
"In 2018, we audited 18 sites.",,,
"All audit results are shared with senior management, and sites are required to respond to all audit observations and track action plans.",,,

"Our Product Stewardship Standard provides a systematic way to manage product and process risks, from the discovery of new medicines through use, to product end-of-life and disposal considerations.",,,
"Reflecting the breadth of product-related sustainability issues we consider and manage, the Product Stewardship Standard guides us in these areas: • Emerging issues: Identifying, analyzing, and managing environmental issues as they arise; • Procurement: Considering environmental factors in purchasing decisions; • Product discovery: Reviewing internal and external research operations to foster high HSE standards; • Product development: Using inherently safer design principles, such as green chemistry, as well as engineering innovations, to identify and reduce HSE hazards from new production processes where possible; • Product packaging: Reducing the amount of packaging and using environmentally preferred materials, when possible, while satisfying regulatory and customer requirements, meeting marketing objectives, and preserving product integrity; • Distribution: Ensuring safe product transport and warehousing while reducing associated environmental impacts; • Marketing and sales: Working with customers to enhance the patient experience related to product environmental performance; • Suppliers, contract operations, and alliances: Evaluating and influencing the HSE performance of suppliers, contract operations, and alliances; and, • Supply chain management: Establishing plans to ensure business continuity and appropriate emergency response, if needed.ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT Green Chemistry and Engineering in Research and Development The research and development phase significantly influences the environmental footprint of pharmaceutical manufacturing.",,,
"At Lilly, we strive to embed environmental innovation early in the product development lifecycle through our focus on green chemistry and end-product engineering.",,,
Our green chemistry initiatives include developing manufacturing processes that use less- toxic chemical alternatives where feasible.,,,
"We explore innovations that can lessen or eliminate potential negative environmental outputs, which can result from production of a medicine.",,,
Green chemistry and engineering have been a focus area at Lilly for many years.,,,
"We engage in a variety of activities, including: • Eliminating or reducing the hazardous materials used to make a product; • Focusing specifically on removal of substances of very high concern, classified as potentially carcinogenic, HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 45 mutagenic or toxic for reproduction by the European Chemicals Agency; • Shrinking the waste profiles of certain molecules through reduced solvent and water use; • Increasing the overall efficiency of material use; • Advancing the underlying green chemistry of medicine development and making production both safer and more environmentally friendly through a commitment to continuous process improvement; and, • Implementing new manufacturing technologies that minimize environmental impact, including continuous flow processes, which Lilly has worked to advance in the pharmaceutical industry.",,,
"When we are developing a new human medicine at Lilly, green chemistry considerations are a complement to other criteria such as quality, cost, and speed to market.",,,
"In fact, in most cases green chemistry improvements are directly proportional to reduced product costs as these improvements typically deliver higher product quality and yield.",,,
"From the selection of candidate molecules, through the identification of manufacturing processes, our established business practices hold our development teams accountable for process efficiency, the type and quantity of materials used, and safety.",,,
"At major milestones, we evaluate success and share feedback with development teams.",,,
"We share guidelines, such as the Lilly solvent selection guide and safety information, with our external partners to ensure consistent objectives, processes, and outcomes.",,,
"Employing green chemistry and engineering, we have been able to enhance the safety profile of manufacturing processes by significantly reducing the risk scale of the most hazardous manufacturing steps.",,,
We are also focused on the adoption of greener and safer solvents where possible.,,,
"For example, we have replaced several hazardous solvents with safer alternatives, including significant, nearly carbon-neutral, efforts to limit the use of dichloromethane (a hazardous air pollutant and suspected carcinogen).",,,
"GLOBAL CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT Governments around the world and across many of the regions where we operate have developed chemical management legislation—such as the REACH regulation in the European Union (EU)—that requires companies to collect and register information about the chemicals they manufacture or use, unless those chemicals are exempt.",,,
"These regulations may require replacing chemicals identified as hazardous with safer alternatives, when available.",,,
"To address these concerns, Lilly hasimplemented a formal program and screening process to evaluate designated “chemicals of concern” throughout the research and development process.",,,
Our process also addresses mitigation steps where new restrictions may impact our existing operations.,,,
This allows us to ensure that our facilities and supply chain remain in compliance with chemical management laws.,,,
"In addition to our green chemistry assessments, during the scale-up of medicine production to manufacturing levels in our human pharmaceutical business, we use an Environmental Development Review (EDR) process to evaluate other potential environmental issues and opportunities.",,,
"This process identifies and addresses potential impacts arising from manufacturing, suggests process improvements, and facilitates learning as new medicines transition from the laboratory to the manufacturing facility.",,,
"EXTERNAL COLLABORATIONS Lilly actively pursues wider industry collaborations to help advance green chemistry, through a combination of dialogue and leadership with peer companies, scientific partnerships, and sponsorship of research.",,,
"In 2018, we were involved in the following pre-competitive collaborations: • American Chemical Society (ACS) Pharmaceutical Roundtable: Lilly co-chairs this important group, which has grown from three companies in 2005 to 28 today.",,,
"In 2018, Lilly continued to lead a subgroup focused on greener peptide, oligonucleotide, and antibody-drug conjugate development and manufacture.",,,
"Over the past decade, peptides have shown great potential as therapeutic targets in both human and animal health, but their manufacture routinely involves hazardous reagents, produces high waste-to-mass ratios, and requires solvent- intensive purification systems.",,,
"By investing early in environmentally friendly production methods, participating companies hope to create the scale necessary for these technologies to become cost-competitive in the long run.",,,
• IQ Consortium: Lilly continues working with the IQ Green Chemistry Working Group to promote the Green Aspiration Level (GAL) tool .,,,
"Until now, the use of green chemistry metrics among pharmaceutical companies has been hampered by the lack of an agreed-upon standard.",,,
"This new tool makes the development of objective goals, like process efficiency and mass intensity, easier.",,,
"It uses industry benchmarks to create a unified scoring system for green chemistry formulations, and introduces a new green scorecard for use across the supply chain.",,,
"HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 46Green Chemistry in Action: Replacing Horseshoe Crabs in Endotoxin Testing Lilly microbiologist Jay Bolden is an expert in bacterial endotoxin detection—a process used both by Lilly and the entire pharmaceutical industry to ensure the safety of their products.",,,
He never expected his hobby as a birder to intersect with a novel way to test for harmful bacteria in the lab.,,,
"Yet Jay has helped Lilly to forge a new path, and in the process, he has helped to protect a threatened marine species and the larger ecosystem that depends on it.",,,
"For each batch of injectable medicines and medical devices manufactured across the globe, companies must prove that they have been checked—and tested free of—potentially life-threatening endotoxins.",,,
Water and raw materials used in manufacture must be tested as well.,,,
"Around the world, this process is repeated approximately 70 million times each year, the linchpin of quality testing for the pharmaceutical industry.",,,
"In this process, the humble horseshoe crab plays a vital role: its cloudy blue blood can be used to make an assay, known as LAL, that clots readily in the presence of endotoxins that could prove fatal if exposed to a person’s bloodstream or spinal fluid .",,,
"To satisfy demand, LAL manufacturers capture, bleed, and release an estimated 500,000 horseshoe crabs along the eastern seaboard of the United States.",,,
"Estimates of how many crabs die as a result are hard to pin down, with estimates ranging from five to 30 percent.",,,
"In Asia, manufacturers use local horseshoe crab populations to make an alternative variant of the testing assay, TAL, which is used mainly by pharmaceutical manufacturers in the region.",,,
"Most of the crabs harvested in Asia are ultimately killed after they are bled, and in 2019, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources listed the Asian tri-spine horseshoe crab as an endangered species.",,,
"Compounding adversities for the horseshoe crab are decades of overharvesting for use as eel and whelk bait, and fertilizer, not to mention devastating habitat loss linked to the commercial development of seashore communities and climate change impacts, including more intense storms and rising sea levels that threaten their spawning grounds.",,,
"In the Delaware Bay, home to the world’s largest population of spawning horseshoe crabs, the population has crashed— declining by 90 percent over the past two decades.",,,
"As a keystone species, the crab is vital to area food webs, and its decline has adversely impacted many other animals, notably shorebirds that rely on consuming horseshoe crab eggs to complete their migrations.",,,
"At least one bird species that feeds on the crab’s eggs, the red knot, is now listed as threatened.",,,
"Working at Lilly, Jay had been aware of an alternative method to test for endotoxins using a synthetic alternative— recombinant factor C, or rFC—developed just over 20 years ago.",,,
"However, lacking an official entry in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), and facing regulatory uncertainty in the eyes of health authorities, it required additional validation testing to prove safety for a successful FDA approval.",,,
"Across the industry there was reluctance to undertake this extra validation, as well as concerns about widespread access to the alternative test agent.",,,
Jay began to wonder if he could make a difference.,,,
"He had seen his first red knot in the Delaware Bay in 2005, during one of many birding adventures.",,,
"But now, the bird and its plight held more of a personal connection.",,,
"In 2014, when Jay met Dr. Jack Levin, one of the two scientists who discovered the LAL reaction in the first place, he recalled Dr. Levin saying that if ever LAL were ever to be unseated from its central role as the main endotoxin test agent, it would be because of the birding community.",,,
"The turning point came in 2013, when Lilly began planning an insulin-manufacturing facility in China, where the native horseshoe crab species has been in decline.",,,
"Concerned about potential future supply problems with LAL—and knowing that Lilly is committed to reducing the use of animals in research and testing wherever possible—Jay lobbied and won support from two governance committees at Lilly, getting permission to validate the rFC approach.",,,
"Lilly drew a line in the sand in 2016, applying the rFC test to all new products being developed internally.",,,
We were the first company to submit an application for drug approval to the FDA—Emgality®—to prevent migraine headaches—where the final drug will be tested using rFC.,,,
"In a watershed moment, the FDA approved Emgality in 2018, making it the first medicine approved for the market release using rFC.",,,
"By 2020, Lilly intends to transition 90 percent of our endotoxin tests to the synthetic compound.",,,
"Upon implementation of the rFC test across all Lilly manufacturing sites, on the order of several thousand horseshoe crabs will be saved in the first year and every year thereafter.",,,
"Jay hopes that the ripple effect will be much larger, if the broader pharmaceutical industry can be persuaded to adopt the rFC test as a more efficient and cost-effective approach that doesn’t require the ethical tradeoffs of harvesting live animals.",,,
"JAY BOLDEN Lilly MicrobiologistHEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 47• Training Future Scientists: Through the ACS Pharmaceutical Roundtable and IQ Consortium, Lilly collaborated with other pharmaceutical companies to design and implement a green chemistry curriculum for use at colleges and other organizations, which was presented at the 2018 ACS meeting in New Orleans.",,,
"• Research Grants: Through the ACS Pharmaceutical Roundtable, Lilly is active in selecting and funding researchers who are advancing the field of green chemistry.",,,
"Since 2005, the Pharmaceutical Roundtable has provided more than $2 million in research grants.",,,
"In 2018, five researchers were funded, including one for green peptide chemistry and one for green Suzuki chemistry.",,,
The green peptide process uses fewer solvents than traditional methods to build the peptides—compounds of amino acids that can have medicinal potential.,,,
"The green Suzuki chemistry model, meanwhile, replaced the use of palladium, a rare earth metal that is critical to reducing vehicle air pollution, with iron, a much more commonly-available metal.",,,
Manufacturing The majority of Lilly’s direct environmental impacts are from the manufacturing of medicines.,,,
"We measure and manage these impacts as they relate to energy and water use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the generation of waste and wastewater throughout the manufacturing process.",,,
"Lilly launched an initial public offering (IPO) of Elanco Animal Health Incorporated in September 2018, and divested our remaining interest in Elanco in March 2019, making it an independent, publicly traded company.",,,
"Elanco was previously a division of Lilly, and data from Elanco operations is included in Lilly’s manufacturing data through 2018, including the period immediately following the IPO.",,,
"Beginning in 2019, Lilly will adjust our environmental performance data baseline calculations to reflect the Elanco divestiture.",,,
Lilly recognizes the potential impacts associated with climate change and the risks of severe weather events.,,,
"In 2017, our manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico sustained minor damage from Hurricane Maria.",,,
"Since then, Lilly has completed initial design for a new nine-megawatt combined heat and power system at our Puerto Rico facility.",,,
The project will improve our resiliency to severe weather events and our environmental performance.,,,
See Promoting Cogeneration for more on our work in Puerto Rico.,,,
ENERGY USE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS Lilly set aggressive targets for improving energy efficiency and thereby reducing our GHG emissions.,,,
We have an established global energy management program to ensure continuous improvement and advance progress towards our goals.,,,
"Our multi-faceted approach includes: • Designing for energy efficiency in new or updated processes and facilities; • Operating our facilities and equipment efficiently; • Facilitating the use of advanced energy monitoring and control solutions; • Measuring and internally and externally reporting energy use and related GHG emissions; • Conducting and acting on energy audits and implementing recommended projects to improve energy efficiency; • Evaluating and incorporating alternative energy sources, new technologies, and best practices for energy use and GHG emission reductions; and • Participating in local, regional, and national forums to understand and integrate energy management best practice and to support responsible and cost-effective decision-making and policy development.",,,
"To help identify and assess energy management and technology best practice, Lilly is an active participant in the U.S. EPA’s ENERGY STAR Focus on Energy Efficiency in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing partnership.",,,
"In addition to our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions reduction efforts, we monitor several categories of Scope 3 GHG emissions and are committed to expanding the scope and quality of related data and disclosures.",,,
"In 2018, CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, recognized our efforts with a score of A-, which is considered leadership level.",,,
"Goals and Trends in 2018 Lilly’s 2020 goal is to improve both our energy efficiency and Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity, measured per unit of site space, by 20 percent as compared to our 2012 baseline.",,,
"Through 2018, we decreased our emissions intensity by 12.7 percent compared to our 2012 baseline.",,,
"Total energy consumption was flat compared to 2012, while our energy efficiency improved by 0.7 percent.",,,
"Since 2012, eight of our 11 largest energy-consuming sites—representing nearly 88 percent of our total energy consumption—increased production, in turn increasing their overall energy use per square foot of space.",,,
"At the same time, several of these largest sites improved their energy performance as measured per unit of production.",,,
"While production increases present challenges to our performance against our goals, we encourage and reward these process energy intensity improvements.",,,
"HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 48PROMOTING COGENERATION Cogeneration, which uses combustion to generate electricity on-site while also recovering usable heat, presents another opportunity to reduce GHG emissions in our operations.",,,
"In 2017, we began the design process for a new nine megawatt combined heat and power system at our Puerto Rico facility.",,,
"Since then, Lilly has completed initial design, with major construction expected to begin in 2019.",,,
This project is expected to result in roughly $6 to 7 million of energy savings annually and approximately 15 to 20 percent reduction in GHG emissions for our Puerto Rico facility.,,,
"We also operate combined heat and power systems in Kinsale, Ireland; Sesto, Italy; and Speke, England.Recent energy initiatives include the following: • Global Engineering – Developed a new global energy monitoring system for implementation at Lilly’s largest energy consuming sites, which will provide a platform for collection of energy data and real-time identification of energy saving opportunities.",,,
"This system will be largely implemented in 2019 at our largest sites, including Lilly’s main corporate headquarters, the Lilly Technology Center, and other global manufacturing sites.• Puerto Rico – Designed and began implementation of a chilled water optimization project at a Puerto Rico manufacturing facility, resulting in projected annual energy savings of $160,000, and installed additional LED lighting.",,,
"• Sesto, Italy – Completed projects to increase the use of recovered heat from the combined heat and power system at our manufacturing facility, and installed additional energy monitoring instrumentation to assist in identifying energy savings opportunities.",,,
"Renewable Energy We will continue to evaluate further use of renewable energy to diversify our energy sources, decrease our GHG emissions, and lessen our energy use intensity over time.",,,
"In 2018, energy sourced from renewable sources accounted for 49,000 MWh.",,,
We are members of the Rocky Mountain Institute’s Business Renewables Center and are currently evaluating the feasibility of incorporating more renewable energy sources.,,,
WATER USE AND WASTEWATER Manufacturing operations account for the majority of the water used by Lilly.,,,
"Our manufacturing locations that produce injectable medicines require exceptionally high-quality water, while our utility operations use water for cooling and to support steam boilers.",,,
"Some sites have updated equipment to use waterless cooling systems, and others reclaim water for this purpose.",,,
"To a lesser extent, we consume water for domestic use in our offices.",,,
"Lilly has assessed our water risks, and while we generally operate in locations where water scarcity and quality risk is low, we will continue our focus on conserving water, reducing our intake, and improving water quality.",,,
"Potential future regional water risk, unpredictable costs, and climate change concerns have further strengthened our commitment to use this resource wisely.",,,
"In 2018, our efforts received a B rating from the CDP’s water program, above the average for Biotech, Health Care and Pharmaceutical sector rankings.",,,
"Our Engineering Technology Center helps Lilly sites around the world identify water-saving technologies, and Lilly sites can apply for capital project funding through Lilly’s dedicated Energy, Waste, and Water Reduction Fund.",,,
"Goals and Trends in 2018 In 2013, we introduced a goal to reduce absolute phosphorus emissions in our wastewater discharge by 15 percent by 2020, as compared to our 2014 baseline.",,,
"This goal addresses an issue that is increasingly important to communities, regulators, and investors.",,,
"In 2018, our total wastewater phosphorus emissions declined to approximately 83 metric tonnes, a 34.4 percent decrease from 2014.",,,
"Production cleaning changes and other manufacturing changes decreased the amount of phosphorus discharged at several large sites, thus positively impacting our overall progress on this goal.",,,
"With regard to our goal progress, we have successfully surpassed our 15 percent phosphorus emission reduction goal at the end of 2018.",,,
"As a result, we are setting a stretch goal to reduce an additional 10 percent of phosphorus emissions by 2020 using 2018 as the new baseline year.",,,
"We have significant source reduction projects planned, including phasing out and replacing selected cleaning agents with non-phosphorus- based alternatives.",,,
"In 2018, Lilly’s total water intake was 13.9 billion liters, an increase of just under four percent from 2012, due primarily to production changes.HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 49WASTE Lilly generates both nonhazardous and hazardous waste from its manufacturing processes.",,,
Examples include broth from fermentation operations and waste solvent from the extraction processes used in the manufacture of small molecule pharmaceuticals.,,,
"Lilly uses the following hierarchy of approaches to disposition of waste generated across our operations: • Eliminate or reduce the amount of waste produced; • Reuse materials when possible (including closed loop recycling); • Recycle spent materials to make new products; • Recover energy from waste (through combustion), where possible; • Treat waste to reduce toxicity and volume; and, • Send waste to landfill (as a disposal method of last resort, or when legally required).",,,
"Goals and Trends in 2018 In 2013, we introduced a goal to achieve a 20 percent improvement in waste efficiency by 2020, as compared to our 2012 baseline.",,,
We also aim to increase our recycling rate above 70 percent and decrease our waste-to-landfill below 10 percent of our total waste generated.,,,
"For purposes of tracking progress toward our waste goals, “total waste” does not include material that is directly reused for other purposes, because the bulk of the “wastes” we generate is directly reused.",,,
"Lilly generated 206,000 metric tonnes of waste (including material directly reused) in 2018, representing a decrease of 28 percent compared to 2012, and a 30 percent decrease compared to 2017 amounts.",,,
"We were able to designate 152,000 tonnes of this waste for reuse, much of it as fertilizer.",,,
"After reuse, 54,000 metric tonnes of waste remained.",,,
"With regard to progress toward our goal, we have successfully surpassed our 20 percent waste efficiency improvement target, as our waste efficiency improved by 34 percent between 2012 and the end of 2018.",,,
"Our recycling rate increased in 2018 to 55 percent, up from 47 percent in 2012, and we sent 21 percent of our waste to landfills, compared to 28 percent waste sent to landfill in 2012.",,,
"As we have successfully achieved the waste efficiency aspect of our 2020 goal, for the next two years, we will focus primarily on achieving our recycling and waste-to-landfill targets.",,,
"ENCOURAGING ECO-EFFICIENCY ACROSS OUR OPERATIONS We established the Energy, Waste and Water Reduction Fund in 2006 to encourage projects that reduce our overall environmental impacts.",,,
"The fund supports projects that demonstrate the greatest potential for reductions in emissions and energy use, and that are not covered by local capital budgets.",,,
"Since 2006, Lilly has invested more than $45.5 million in this fund, enabling the implementation of 174 projects, which all told, garnered more than $22 million in savings.",,,
"These projects collectively save more than one trillion BTUs of energy annually, avoiding more than 121,000 metric tonnes of GHG emissions each year, measured as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).",,,
We actively recognize innovation and excellence in HSE management by granting annual HSE awards.,,,
"Nomination for these awards represents a significant accomplishment on behalf of project teams, and we seek to reward teams that have shown an exemplary commitment to helping Lilly achieve energy and GHG emissions reduction goals.",,,
"In addition to criteria such as a project’s energy and GHG reductions, we consider the potential to replicate the approach in other locations.HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 501 Data may be revised compared to prior reports due to changes in calculation methodology and other factors.",,,
Some segments do not add up to totals due to rounding.,,,
"2 In 2015, adjustments were made to data for all years to reflect the acquisition of animal health operations from Lohmann (closed April 30, 2014) and Novartis (closed January 15, 2015).",,,
"3 Data includes GHG emissions and energy use related to manufacturing facilities and other entities with more than $50,000 annual energy spend.",,,
Data for other locations is estimated based on square footage.,,,
"4 Data included in Scope 3 emissions disclosure contain assumptions and estimation as described here: Employee business travel (personal and rental cars, taxi, rail, and air travel) uses WRI GHG Protocol Cross-Sector Tool averages for fuel types, vehicle types, aircraft types, and aircraft travel distances; employee commuting uses EPA average for fuel types, vehicle types, and commuting distances; contracted product transportation and distribution is based on Lilly’s U.S. distribution footprint and extrapolated for distribution outside the United States; waste generated in operations uses Lilly-specific waste carbon content estimates for waste incineration and EPA’s WARM version 12 emission factors for landfilled and land-applied waste, and assumes transportation related emissions only for certain land-applied organic waste types.",,,
"Scope 3 data does not include emissions from sales force travel using company vehicles, use of Lilly owned aircraft, on-site waste incineration, or product distribution with Lilly owned vehicles, as these are included in the Scope 1 data above.",,,
"5 Energy consumption is the total of direct energy consumption and indirect energy consumption, as defined in these footnotes, and does not include mobile sources.",,,
"6 Data includes energy from combustion of coal, fuel oil, natural gas, and liquid propane.",,,
"7 Data includes energy from purchased electricity, steam, and chilled water.",,,
"8 “Water intake” is the total amount of water coming into a site, including water pumped from bodies of surface water and groundwater, as well as water provided by a utility.",,,
"It includes water used in processes, utilities, and other ancillary operations, such as irrigation.",,,
"The term does not include groundwater pumped solely for treatment to satisfy regulatory actions or requirements (e.g., remediation activities where the water is not used for another purpose).",,,
Values do not include the water extracted from wells solely for the purpose of lowering the groundwater table(s) to maintain the physical and structural integrity of building foundations.,,,
Totals include a small amount of rainwater intake not included in other water intake subcategories.,,,
Lilly does not generally collect water data from small locations that house primarily administrative activities such as sales and marketing offices unless they are co-located at a Lilly manufacturing or research facility.,,,
9 Lilly’s waste goals do not include materials that are deemed “reused” without extensive processing.,,,
"Examples include coal ash reused for mine reclamation or road base, and mycelia and urea reused for fertilizer.",,,
10 Lilly classifies an event as a reportable permit-limit exceedance if it involves an exceedance of a numeric permit or license limit that must be reported to the regulatory authority.,,,
"The reporting may be immediate (e.g., within 24 hours) or in a routine compliance report.",,,
These exceedances do not necessarily result in harm to people or the environment.,,,
"11 “Significant spill” in this report refers to any unexpected, unintended, abnormal, or unapproved dumping, leakage, drainage, seepage, discharge, or other loss of a substance that resulted in damage to the environment (i.e., human health, aquatic life, or wildlife) or a material event requiring reporting to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",,,

"As we have broadened our manufacturing base and integrated new acquisitions into our operations, we have taken significant steps to reduce our exposure to the risks inherent in managing a global supply chain.",,,
Lilly continues to strengthen our ongoing efforts to monitor our supply chain for performance on HSE indicators.,,,
"We have also taken steps to educate and engage our suppliers more directly on HSE issues, and we have taken a more active role in helping our suppliers build expertise around HSE topics.",,,
"This includes our ongoing work as part of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), a non-profit business membership organization founded in 2006, which counts Lilly as one of its inaugural members.",,,
"In 2018, Lilly HSE professionals led two PSCI committees and seven Lilly HSE professionals served on PSCI’s committees.",,,
"GOVERNANCE OF SUPPLY CHAIN AT LILLY PSCI, with its member companies, created and maintain the Pharmaceutical Industry Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management (the PSCI Principles).",,,
"The PSCI Principles provide our industry with consistent supplier performance standards in the areas of ethics, labor, health and safety, the environment, and related management systems.",,,
"At Lilly, we have aligned several codes, policies and procedures with the PSCI Principles, including the following: • Lilly’s Global Product Stewardship Standard, which details our approach to managing risk across the value chain and directly addresses our supply chain due diligence and supplier HSE risk assessment and management practices • Lilly Supplier Code of Business Conduct, applicable to all suppliers • Relevant procurement standards • Standard contract language applicable to providers of contract manufacturing services Lilly manufacturing procurement contracts ask that suppliers support the PSCI Principles and conform to the HSE expectations outlined in our Supplier Code of Business Conduct.",,,
"Standard contract language also requires that manufacturing suppliers agree to submit, if requested, to audits that assess compliance with the principles.",,,
Lilly has a formal process for targeting those suppliers that we believe represent the greatest potential HSE risk for this additional scrutiny.,,,
We intervene quickly when we become aware of serious HSE issues.,,,
"If a supplier in question does not take swift corrective action, as is our expectation, we reserve the right to halt production or terminate contracts.",,,
"HSE considerations are integrated into Lilly’s formal, annual process for evaluating manufacturing suppliers.",,,
"ASSESSING CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND RESEARCH LABORATORIES For more than a decade, Lilly HSE professionals have worked to assess and strengthen performance at the external research laboratories and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) with which we do business.",,,
"We use a standard auditing methodology and reporting framework for addressing risk, and a summary of results is included in the quarterly reports received by the board of directors’ public policy and compliance committee.",,,
"We designate suppliers that are critical to our business as “suppliers of focus,” and take a special interest in their capabilities and performance.",,,
"In 2018, we conducted onsite audits at 33 CMO sites.",,,
OTHER SUPPLIER EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT Lilly is an active PSCI member and our HSE professionals have led or participated in a number of PSCI sponsored webinars and in-country events.,,,
"In 2018, Lilly professionals participated in supplier capability training in China and India, building on work in 2017 conducting third-party auditor training.",,,
"Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing affiliates around the world develop goals and implement improvement strategies as part of our GREENDirections program, which focuses on fleet fuel economy and GHG emissions, office energy conservation, and waste reduction.",,,
"Each year, our affiliates look for opportunities to enhance their environmental performance by identifying and implementing new projects and setting targets.",,,
"On the road, Lilly optimizes the fuel efficiency of our sales force fleet by choosing vehicles with better fuel economy, and we promote driving and work practices that emphasize safety and fuel savings.",,,
"These efforts, in turn, also reduce the GHG emissions associated with our sales fleet.",,,
"Lilly centrally manages vehicle selection across the European Union and across the United States, which improves efficiency while enabling us to implement strong safety and environmental standards.",,,
"HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 52Packaging and Transportation We consider many factors in selecting product packaging, including sustainability considerations, such as materials use and recyclability.",,,
Pharmaceutical packaging must meet stringent regulatory and internal standards.,,,
"In some cases, this prevents us from using recycled content in packaging, as is the case with containers that come into direct contact with our products, where we require virgin materials be used to deter counterfeiting.",,,
"Where we can, we continually seek to improve packaging design to reduce the amount of packaging used, include lower-impact materials, and ensure recyclability.",,,
Our Product Stewardship Standard helps set expectations for these efforts.,,,
"In transporting our products, we have made strides in reducing the volume of empty space in the packages we ship, which has increased our overall fleet efficiency.",,,
"Additionally, we have achieved GHG emission reductions by changing the shipping mode for some of our pharmaceutical products from air to ocean.",,,
"In 2018, we shipped 50 percent of our product via ocean, resulting in reduced GHG emissions.",,,
Another benefit of ocean shipping is an overall reduction in packaging used because less protective packaging is required during transport.,,,
"Product End-of-Life Unlike many consumer products that can be recycled, or are composed of materials that can be reclaimed at the end of their usefulness, medicines are by nature different.",,,
Public health regulations often prohibit the use of recovered materials from pharmaceutical products like those produced by Lilly.,,,
"Lilly continues to work with customers, industry partners, and public health officials to address these product end-of-life issues.",,,
Our Product Stewardship Governance Committee meets quarterly and regularly engages with our leadership to better integrate product stewardship efforts into our business.,,,
"We promote policy decisions that are efficient, effective, and that protect both human health and the environment.",,,
"We also support educating patients and caregivers on proper disposal of medicines, as well as disposal of syringes, needles, and other sharps used in home settings.",,,
"We communicate this information to patients through product user manuals, and through The Lilly Answers Center, a hotline that answers frequently asked questions.",,,
"We are actively involved in the Pharmaceutical Product Stewardship Work Group , a U.S.-based membership association of manufacturers of prescription and over-the-counter medicines that supports compliance with U.S. household disposal regulations for unused medicines and sharps.",,,
"We also engage with other industry stakeholders in the European Union, such as European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) , as well as in Canada (Health Products Stewardship Association) .",,,
"Pharmaceuticals in the Environment (PiE) After they are used to improve human and animal health, medicines enter our natural environment through the normal biological processes of waste elimination.",,,
They may also enter the environment from improper disposal of unused products or through manufacturing discharges.,,,
"Residues of these medicines may pass through waste and sewage treatment facilities and enter rivers, streams, or lakes.",,,
"While reported concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the environment (PiE) are usually extremely low, their presence and biological potency raise questions about potential risks to humans and the environment.",,,
"Reports such as the World Health Organization’s Pharmaceuticals in Drinking Water (2012) and the multiple publications following an extensive, three-year joint study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Geological Survey on the presence of contaminants in drinking water and surface water have concluded that the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in drinking water are unlikely to have a direct impact on human health and aquatic life.",,,
"However, some health advocates and researchers are concerned that low concentrations of antibiotics in the environment comprise an indirect threat to human health by promoting the development of antimicrobial resistant genes in bacteria.",,,
"Questions have also been raised about the impact of the pharmaceutical supply chain, especially when those suppliers are located in countries that may lack rigorous environmental protection standards.",,,
Lilly is committed to ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used in our products do not have a negative impact on the environment whether exposure is associated with end use or manufacturing.,,,
We are committed to understanding the public’s questions and concerns related to PiE.,,,
"GOVERNANCE OF P iE AT LILLY Due to the importance of PiE issues to Lilly and our stakeholders, we have established a PiE Governance Committee that reports to our executive-level Global HSE Committee.",,,
"The PiE Governance Committee sets strategic direction related to PiE and provides long- range oversight for the program that controls active HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 53pharmaceutical discharges from manufacturing sites, our Lilly Aquatic Exposure Guideline (LAEG) program.",,,
The LAEG program determines containment needed at our manufacturing sites to protect environmental species living in downstream surface waters in addition to humans and wildlife using those surface waters.,,,
This program has been in place for many years for Lilly facilities.,,,
"For outsourced segments of our manufacturing processes, we have begun to implement our LAEG program with contract manufacturers (third party suppliers) of targeted products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.",,,
"ENVIRONMENTAL DATA AND RISK ASSESSMENTS FOR LILLY API s We assess our medicines for potential environmental impacts, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements and internal standards before introducing our products to markets.",,,
"We use procedures recommended by U.S., Canadian and European regulatory agencies for identifying and minimizing risks from residues of our products in the environment, and for determining predicted no-effect concentration values for our medicines.",,,
We also make information on the environmental hazards and impacts of our pharmaceutical products available through product safety data sheets and through the FASS product database published by the Swedish Pharmaceutical Trade Association.,,,
"ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY OF MANUFACTURING To study the overall impact on the local environment, our manufacturing site in Kinsale, Ireland, initiated a continuous evaluation of aquatic habitat quality in 1978.",,,
The Kinsale Harbour Study is maintained by the National University of Ireland Galway and is one of the longest studies of marine coastline conducted anywhere in the world.,,,
The evaluation has shown no evidence of an adverse impact from the Lilly wastewater discharge point on any aspect of habitat quality in the study area.,,,
Results have been published in peer-reviewed scientific publications and several project reports.,,,
"This project continues to support academic research for university students.EXTERNAL COLLABORATIONS We continue to partner with industry, academia, and governments to improve both our understanding of, and our response to, PiE.",,,
"Among ongoing efforts in 2018, Lilly scientists and technical experts have: • Supported the Eco-Pharmaco-Stewardship plan in collaboration with EFPIA and the Inter-Association Initiative on PiE, including a proposal for extended environmental risk assessment evaluations, and a model for wastewater control limits for pharmaceutical residues at manufacturing facilities; • Reviewed articles in scientific journals, presented at conferences and workshops, and participated in meetings concerning the safety of pharmaceutical residues in water, in collaboration with the U.S. EPA, and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry; • Served on technical committees addressing topics related to PiE for industry trade associations such as EFPIA; and, • Engaged with the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) team developing training for external manufacturing partners on risk-based approaches to managing APIs in manufacturing effluents.",,,

"IMPROVED METHODOLOGIES FOR ASSESSING ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS Lilly participates in the Intelligence-led Assessment of Pharmaceuticals in the Environment project (iPiE project) , a program supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private partnership coordinated by the European Commission and the industry group EFPIA, in collaboration with universities and other research organizations, public bodies, and nonprofit groups.",,,
"The iPiE project develops frameworks, methods, databases, and software tools to support environmental testing for new pharmaceuticals and prioritizes the testing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that were approved for use before 2006 and that remain in use today.",,,
"The frameworks draw upon existing data on the environmental impact of APIs, toxicological studies, and computer models.",,,
"Our current commitment to the project runs through 2019.HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 54PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS Antibiotics, including those manufactured by Elanco, are one way, but not the only way, that farmers keep their animals healthy.",,,
"Feeding animals carefully balanced diets to strengthen their immune systems and providing clean, comfortable, well-maintained housing are also important.",,,
"But because bacteria and other microbes are constantly evolving and found everywhere in the environment, it’s virtually impossible to prevent animals from being exposed to disease.",,,
This is true whether animals are kept on open ranges or housed indoors.,,,
"Antibiotic resistance occurs naturally over time, as bacteria develop resistant genes that are then passed on to other bacteria.",,,
This natural process can be magnified by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics.,,,
"At Elanco, we believe that the concern over reduced effectiveness of antibiotics is real and needs to be addressed.",,,
"All those involved—the human, animal, and environmental health communities—must take responsibility and work together to develop long-term, responsible solutions.",,,
"For our part, Elanco is committed to bringing greater clarity to issues around antibiotic stewardship and engaging in collectively shaping science-based recommendations on responsible use, animal welfare, and the long-term sustainability of the food system.",,,
"Elanco Animal Health has updated its commitment to fighting antimicrobial resistance, which includes promoting responsible antibiotic use practices and policies while developing alternatives to medically important antibiotics (a subset of which include critically important antibiotics to human health).",,,
"ELANCO’S ANTIBIOTIC STEWARDSHIP PLAN The Antimicrobial Resistance Challenge, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS), is a yearlong effort to accelerate the fight against antimicrobial resistance with action across governments and industries.",,,
"As part of this effort, Elanco has committed to: • Invest at least half of Elanco’s food animal research and development budget in projects dedicated to developing alternatives to shared-class antibiotics; • Increase veterinary and professional oversight access in countries with limited resources through new partnerships; • Expand data collection and analytics to inform animal health professionals on best practices, and; • Encourage vaccination and nutrition programs that reduce the need for medically important antibiotics by preventing disease.",,,
Elanco’s commitment—outlined within the CDC’s Antimicrobial Resistance Challenge materials—is the next step in its eight-point antibiotic stewardship plan.,,,
"Since the inception of the antibiotic stewardship plan in 2015, Elanco has made tangible progress, including the following: • Changed nearly 100 labels to remove growth promotion claims from our medically important antibiotic molecules globally, even if the practice is allowed by local regulation; • Completed submission of 67 labels to move products from over-the-counter use to be under the oversight of a veterinarian in the countries where over-the-counter uses remained and veterinary infrastructure exists; • Brought more than 15 antibiotic alternatives into our pipeline to help producers replace antibiotics when possible; • Convened a landmark, first-of-its-kind One Health Antibiotic Stewardship Summit for more than 200 global animal protein industry and food chain leaders and declared priorities to help combat antimicrobial resistance as part of efforts to produce a sustainable food supply, and; • Joined with 200 other companies and 700,000 veterinarians worldwide to undersign Health for Animals’ “Commitments and Actions on Antibiotic Use,” which outlines the five guiding responsible use principles of the animal medicines industry.",,,
It is of utmost importance we address the complex challenge of antimicrobial resistance and preserve the effectiveness of medicines for people and animals.,,,
Supporting the CDC and HHS effort is an important step in reaffirming our commitment to responsible antibiotic usage and veterinary oversight capacity around the world.,,,
"This is a global issue, and any solution will require global participation across all sectors of human and animal health .” - JEFF SIMMONS | PRESIDENT AND CEO, ELANCO“HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 55Lilly focuses on creating a companywide culture where best-in-class safety practices are intuitively and consistently followed.",,,
"To do this, we assess and continuously strive to improve our safety performance across our entire enterprise.",,,
We believe this ongoing commitment promotes the well-being of our employees and helps safeguard communities where we operate.,,,
"At Lilly, we measure both leading and lagging indicators when assessing our overall safety performance.",,,
"We have found that tracking leading—or predictive indicators—such as ergonomic risk, safety culture surveys, and vehicle safety training contributes greatly to our company safety culture.",,,
Using these indicators in conjunction with measures of lagging indicators—such as our recordable and lost-time injury rates—we are able to paint a comprehensive picture of the areas that most influence employee safety across Lilly.,,,
"This approach allows us to both influence change where needed, and track our safety progress in concrete ways over time.",,,
"Since we introduced our global safety goals in 2007, our total recordable injury and illness rate has declined by nearly 45 percent, equivalent to the prevention of hundreds of injuries and illnesses to Lilly employees across the globe.",,,
"In 2013, we established new goals for the three occupational safety metrics we track: recordable injuries, lost-time injuries, and motor vehicle collision rate.",,,
"These goals were developed to help reduce our injury rates across a seven-year period, 2014 through 2020.",,,
"In 2017, Lilly established new leading indicators focused on office ergonomic risk and motor vehicle safety designed to influence behavior change and reduce company injury and illness rates.",,,
"These metrics are shared with the executive committee quarterly, emphasizing the importance of maintaining an employee safety culture and minimizing risk.EMPLOYEE SAFETY Promoting a Culture of Safety at Lilly We know that to reach our goals for safety performance, Lilly must continue to instill and promote a best-in-class safety culture.",,,
"We use a well-known model—the DuPont™ Bradley Curve™—to measure our progress, and we will continue to use this model in the foreseeable future.",,,
"In 2018, we launched a number of key initiatives to continue improving our performance in this area, including: • Developing our first draft of safety culture requirements to be included in our global Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) standards that apply across the company; • Collaborating with external partners to develop a new training course on safety management fundamentals for new leaders at Lilly;• Completing training/education for all levels of leadership within the pharmaceutical development organization to improve HSE leadership and culture; • Piloting an advanced initiative working with an external partner to improve informal risk assessment and peer-to-peer conversations to improve operational safety at the task level; • Continuing expansion of existing behavioral-based safety efforts and tools across the organization that focus on reducing human error and further engagement of employees and leadership; and • Developing and executing safety culture improvement plans for manufacturing, research and development, and sales affiliate sites.",,,
"HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENT | PAGE 56Reducing the Potential for Serious Injury While the most common work-related injuries are covered by our safety programs, we also have committed to systematically address infrequent but severe events, where the consequences can be potentially life-altering or fatal.",,,
"To prevent such serious injuries and fatalities (SIFs), we subscribe to the following model: • Train employees at all levels on the SIF prevention model and key SIF definitions • Measure SIF events and potential SIF events across the entire company • Identify and mitigate SIF precursors • Integrate SIF prevention into existing business processes In 2018, as part of a continuous improvement effort, we created a global SIF team responsible for analyzing potential SIF events and precursors.",,,
"The SIF team analyzes event data, always focusing on reducing the probability of employees’ exposure to high-risk hazards.",,,
Specific actions conducted in 2018 include: • Conducting workshops where employees could voice their opinions and identify improvements related to SIF; • Sharing near-miss events across the globe with an emphasis on learning and prevention; • Conducting forklift and dock safety assessments to identify and mitigate SIF precursors; and • Approving a global plan to upgrade engineering controls for dock loading and unloading operations.,,,

,Lilly is exploring new ways to achieve the right level of pricing in different markets and we advocate for policy changes that help increase access to medicines.,,
,Value- based and outcomes-based reimbursement models are examples of payment initiatives that offer the ability to deliver greater economic and health value to healthcare systems.,,
,"When countries look at health costs and related outcomes holistically, rather than in budget silos, it is clear that medications deliver substantial benefits in both human and economic terms.",,
,"As a global company, we are particularly aware of the economic circumstances in many developing countries that can make access to medicines difficult.",,
,"In response, Lilly has developed alternative business models, recognizing that the poorest nations should pay less than wealthy nations.",,
,"Lilly also supports efforts to decrease the final price of medicines to patients, such as minimizing taxes of all types and limiting markups applied in the supply chain.",,
,"In addition, Lilly has a long-standing policy of not seeking or enforcing patents for medicines in any of the least developed countries, as defined by the United Nations.Lilly’s Support of Universal Healthcare Principles In September 2019, Lilly sent a representative of our global health team to the first-ever high-level meeting of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly focused exclusively on universal health coverage (UHC).",,

,"Treating Diabetes: Then and Now Nearly 100 years ago, insulin was a new invention, but production was crude.",,
,"To produce a vial of insulin, pancreases from livestock were ground up to extract the life-saving substance—leading to purity and quality concerns.",,
,"In addition, the initial insulins did not closely mimic the way a healthy body regulates insulin.",,
,"They did not fit into the lives of those living with diabetes, making it difficult to stay compliant with treatment.",,
,"Before the discovery of insulin, a child diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 10 typically died less than three years after being diagnosed.",,
,Insulin was literally life-saving.,,
,"Today, insulin extends life expectancy for people with Type 1 diabetes into their early 60s and 70s.",,
,"That’s good, but still less than the average American.",,
,"At Lilly, we’re not just treating diabetes, we’re trying to stop it.",,
,"Lilly scientists are developing non-insulin drugs and therapies that, if successful, could put diabetes in remission or even cure it for some.",,
,"We are also pursuing advances to make insulin treatment more effective, such as our “connected care” strategy—featuring an advanced insulin pen and insulin pump—and our partnership with Sigilon Therapeutics to develop cell therapies.",,
,"Human Rights | Page 25Across the United States, a growing number of patients—including those who rely on Lilly insulin—are exposed to the full retail price of their medicine at the pharmacy.",,
,This is one reason why we’ve focused our affordability solutions on people living with diabetes.,,
,"To fill gaps in the current healthcare system, Lilly offers several insulin affordability programs for people who are most likely to be paying higher out-of-pocket costs.",,
,"This includes those in high-deductible insurance plans, the uninsured, and seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D. Here are some of the solutions we’ve implemented: • Automatic Savings*: Lilly offers automatic savings directly to people with commercial insurance by limiting their out-of- pocket costs at retail pharmacies.",,
,"• Non-Branded Insulins: Since 2019, Lilly has made three lower list-priced insulin products available.",,
,These unbranded versions allow Lilly to provide lower-priced insulins more quickly without disrupting access to branded Humalog—which thousands of insured patients depend on and which will remain available for people who want to continue accessing it through their current insurance plans.,,
,"• Lilly Diabetes Solution Center: People who use Lilly insulin can learn about all options that may reduce their out-of- pocket costs by calling the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, a patient-focused hotline staffed by medical professionals that connects people living with diabetes to various solutions based on their individual circumstances.",,
,"• Insulin Donations: Lilly also donates medicines to charitable organizations that provide free medicine, including insulin, to patients meeting program eligibility requirements.",,
,"In the last five years, Lilly has donated more than 7 million insulin vials and pens to U.S. charitable organizations, including Americares, Direct Relief, Dispensary of Hope and the Lilly Cares Foundation.",,
,See more details on this work in the Global Health section of this report.,,
,"Our programs are helping up to 20,000 people each month better afford their insulin.",,

,"Other Long-Term Insulin Pricing Policy Solutions At Lilly, we feel that broader systemic change is needed to increase affordable access to insulin.",,
,"In recent years, we have begun to see meaningful answers for people who live with diabetes.",,
,"Payers in the healthcare system, including insurance companies, for instance, are finding ways to pass rebates on to patients and lower co-pays for insulin.",,
,"These actions ease the burdens for most people in these coverage gap areas, but longer-term solutions are still needed.",,
,We’re actively working with other stakeholders throughout the healthcare system to seek policy solutions to address gaps in our current healthcare system.,,
,Some of these include: • Rebate Pass Through: We continue to advocate for insurers to pass through our negotiated rebates directly to consumers at the pharmacy counter.,,
,• First Dollar Coverage: We’re supportive of efforts to exempt certain healthcare services for chronic conditions—including medicines such as insulin—from an insurance plan’s deductible.,,
,• Medicare Part D Out-of-Pocket Caps: We’re supportive of legislation to cap out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Part D patients.,,
,We believe a cap would provide a critical financial safeguard for patients.,,
,"Preventive Care Benefits Include Insulin One welcome sign of cost relief came in 2019, in the form of recent guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , which confirms that “insulins and glucose lowering agents” are preventive care medicines that may be exempted from patients’ deductibles in high-deductible health plans.",,
,"In so doing, this guidance can help people with diabetes save money immediately when refilling their prescriptions.",,
,This guidance is also credited with helping ensure that people who use pre-tax health savings accounts can use these funds to help pay for their insulin without worrying about violating IRS rules.,,
,"And, in turn, it’s hoped that the guidance will translate into more patients adhering to the regimen prescribed by their doctors, preventing the development of costly complications.",,
,"Value vs. Volume: An Alternative Way to Think About Medicines When a patient seeks medical care, the healthcare system’s top goal should be improving the patient’s health—and medical interventions, including medicines, should be evaluated based on how well the patient’s health improves.",,
,This seems obvious—but it’s not how our current payment system works.,,
,"Under the existing fee-for-service model common in the United States, payments are based on the number of treatments or services provided, not upon whether a patient actually sees improvements in his or her health.",,
,"However, as healthcare costs and rates of chronic disease continue to rise, there has been increased urgency to deliver care that brings greater value to both the patient and the healthcare system as a whole.",,
,We believe that innovative value-based arrangements (VBAs) could be an important part of the solution.,,
,"VBAs are one potential solution that allows Lilly to stand behind the health outcomes we expect our medicines to deliver, when used appropriately.",,
,Such arrangements link the cost of our medicine more directly to patient outcomes.,,
,A VBA includes predefined patient health outcomes and/or associated performance metrics based on the observed impact of a particular medicine on the person taking it.,,
,"Such metrics can include favorable test results, reducing re-hospitalization rates, or improving medication adherence.",,
,This approach can transform the healthcare system to one that is about value—versus the volume of medicines purchased.,,
,"Human Rights | Page 27Human Rights | Page 28In the United States, 20 percent of revenue flowing through access-based contracts has a value-based component, and we have more than 300 alternative access contracts in other global markets, many of which are value-based.",,
,Each VBA we participate in becomes an opportunity to get better at predicting the kind of meaningful real-world data we need to make these arrangements as effective as possible in improving health.,,
,"In many cases, VBAs improve access to a medicine for eligible patients.",,
,"And given medicines in these arrangements are generally made available based on how well they work in specific sub-populations, patients can also get care that is more personalized.",,
,"Over the long term, the results from these arrangements can help inform and improve future research and development efforts.We believe VBAs have the potential to improve patient outcomes while lowering costs for the entire healthcare system, but it will require increased collaboration between payers, health systems, patients and industry to make it happen.",,
,Moving to a system that is value-based can help ensure payers win with improved outcomes and associated savings.,,
,"Patients can win too, with better outcomes and, hopefully, better access to the medicine they need.",,
,"At Lilly, we continue to advocate for legislative and regulatory changes that support this transition and we think this is one of the most important long-term changes we can make as an industry.",,
,“The benefit of value-based arrangements isn’t just to give access to medicines.,,
,"They also allow us to learn about real world results and gather data so we can continue to improve outcomes.” —Erin Huntington, senior director, pricing, reimbursement and access strategy Making Health Care More Affordable for Lilly Employees and All Employees Beginning in 2020, Lilly’s health plan cut patients’ costs on all insulins to a new low: zero.",,
,This is our latest step to reduce out-of-pocket costs for medicines.,,
,We’ve found it helps both our people and our health plan to save money.,,
,"In 2019, we shared our experience in a report on health benefits innovation .",,
,We believe it’s time for employers— who cover more than half of all Americans—to help drive the healthcare and insurance systems to do a better job caring for people with chronic diseases.,,
,"Employers are spending more than ever to provide health benefits to their workers—more than $20,000 for family coverage.",,
,Yet two out of every five workers say their employers could do better.,,
,"Many, especially those with chronic illnesses, say they struggle with affordability and access to the care they need.",,
,"If more employers—especially large employers—reduce cost-sharing for high-value therapies, they can change the insurance market in ways that improve health and productivity while constraining costs.",,
,"Like all employers, Lilly works every year to minimize the rising costs of health care.",,
,"For more than a decade, we’ve offered exclusively high-deductible plans to our employees.",,
,But we take certain steps to make sure our high deductibles don’t lead our people to skip or ration the care they need: • We fund our employees’ health savings accounts all at once in January.,,
,"Whether someone gets sick around New Year’s Day or Thanksgiving Day, they should have money to help cover their costs.• We exempt preventive and chronic disease medications from our health plan deductibles.",,
,"That means Lilly employees, retirees and their families pay 10 percent to 20 percent of those medicines’ prices, but not the full retail price.",,
,"• For all medicines, Lilly’s health plan has lowered costs by passing through rebates to patients at the point of sale.",,
,"In just one year, sharing these rebates helped more than 11,000 of our members, who saved $265 on average—or nearly $3 million collectively.",,
,"• Employees and their eligible family members with diabetes can receive a free connected glucose meter and related supplies, along with real-time support from trained diabetes educators.",,
,"As we’ve expanded these cost-saving policies, premiums for our plan (both company-paid and employee-paid) have grown an average of just three percent annually—half as fast as the trend among all employers.",,
,"Of course, not everyone in the United States has access to employer-based health coverage.",,
,"Yet for the millions of Americans who do rely on their employers for their healthcare coverage, we believe employers can lead the way to making health care work better for their employees.",,
,"Even among the largest U.S. employers, just one-third today offer reduced or no cost arrangements for medicines treating chronic diseases.",,
,C-suite leadership at companies across the United States can make the long-term decisions and trade-offs needed to do health benefits more effectively.,,

,,,Our purpose is to make new medicines that make life better for people around the world.
,,,"While leveraging science and medicine to improve lives is by itself sustaining for humankind, we understand discovering, developing and making medicines alone is not enough."
,,,"We’re investing in new ways to make medicines and care more accessible, affordable and useful for everyone who needs them."
,,,"To do this, we are reaching across industry and geographic boundaries to collaborate with all who share our goals of accelerating and improving access in the health-care system."
,,,"We further extend our impact by strengthening communities and making a positive difference in greater social issues that matter to our business, our employees and society."
,,,The broad overall policy of this concern is to conduct its affairs so that 'the greatest good for the greatest number over the longest period of time' will result.
,,,"Mr. Eli Lilly 1947 Lilly’s COVID-19 response exemplifies each of these elements, as we applied the full force of our scientific expertise to combat the pandemic and its devastating effects on our most vulnerable communities and health systems around the world."
,,,"We moved quickly to protect the well-being of our workforce, led the response to enormous testing deficits in our home state and collaborated across public and private sectors to discover new COVID-19 antibodies in record time – all while maintaining a steady supply of medicines for about 45 million people who rely on us."
,,,"Although we aren’t done battling COVID-19, we are changed by this challenge."
,,,"More than ever, we see the positive impact we can have to improve the human condition through new medicine coupled with responsible and sustainable actions, to ensure more people benefit and our work fits into the broader challenges the world faces."
,,,"Key to this effort is prioritizing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals and investing in resources to expand our progress."
,,,"Sustainability at Lilly For Lilly, sustainability starts with our purpose and is guided by our long-standing values of integrity, excellence and respect for people."
,,,"Sustainability has always been central to Lilly, and we dedicate ourselves to ensuring our sustainability efforts help address important issues for our business, our employees and society."
,,,"As we enter our 146th year, we have evolved and continue to evolve our sustainability efforts."
,,,"After seeking input from a broad spectrum of stakeholders, we identified key ESG topics relevant for our company and industry, created a new position to lead ESG strategy and adopted common reporting frameworks."
,,,We’ll use the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) frameworks and continue to report our progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
,,,"We have also created this ESG site to provide a comprehensive picture of our sustainability strategy, goals and results."
,,,"To provide ESG governance and oversight, we have clear lines of responsibility from Lilly’s board of directors and executive committee to an ESG governance committee that is responsible for operationalizing our strategy."
,,,"Human Capital Management is Foundational Whatever we accomplish is made possible by our talented, dedicated people."
,,,Fulfilling our purpose requires highly skilled employees to be fully engaged in solving the world’s toughest health challenges.

,,,"In our battle against COVID-19, we’ve collaborated with the Gates Foundation to supply our treatment antibodies to low- and middle-income countries."
,,,"We use philanthropy and shared-value approaches to improve health systems and concentrate on diseases where we have deep technical expertise, such as our collaboration with Life for a Child that will expand access to care for approximately 150,000 youth with diabetes across 65 countries."
,,,"We’ve also made a $100 million commitment to the pharma-led AMR Action Fund, the world’s largest public-private partnership addressing the global health threat of antibiotic-resistant infections."
,,,"In the U.S., as we work to advance discussions to address structural factors that increase costs to patients, we continue to partner with the nonprofit and public sectors to help millions of people gain access to Lilly medicines."
,,,"As an example, Lilly insulins are now available to patients for $35 or less per month, with or without insurance."
,,,"Protecting the Planet Because making medicines requires the use of valuable resources, including energy, water and raw materials, we work to reduce our environmental footprint with a focus on addressing climate change, waste and water security."
,,,We believe that maintaining a safe operation for our workers and communities is our first responsibility – no one should get hurt at work or in our communities because of our work.
,,,We’ve set ambitious 2030 environmental goals.
,,,"For climate, we plan to secure 100% of our purchased electricity from renewable sources, make our own operations carbon neutral and enhance tracking and reporting of our full value-chain emissions."
,,,"For waste, our goals are to send zero waste to landfills from our routine operations, to repurpose 100% of plastic waste for beneficial use – with at least 90% recycled or reused and to integrate sustainability-focused design principles into product and packaging design processes."
,,,"Finally, for water, we plan to establish and conform to water management plans for Lilly sites in water-stressed areas, and continue to have 100% of Lilly sites meet predicted no-effect concentrations for pharmaceuticals in the environment."
,,,We will ensure appropriate controls are in place with Lilly contract manufacturers to prevent discharge of pharmaceuticals in wastewater above applicable no-effect concentration values.
,,,ESG is How we Operate More important than setting ambitious goals is achieving them.
,,,This starts with embedding annual goals into the performance targets of the CEO and key executives.
,,,We review progress on these goals as a full executive committee quarterly and the board annually.
,,,"Leaders are responsible for embedding these targets throughout their operations and are held accountable for progress and ultimately the achievement of our targets, including through the annual compensation process."

,,,Contact Transparency Pricing in the U.S. Pricing our medicines is one of the most important decisions we make as a company.
,,,We aim to strike a balance between access and affordability for patients while sustaining investments in life-changing treatments for some of today’s most serious diseases.
,,,"When making pricing considerations, we take into account the following: Customer perspective – The unmet needs that medicines can fulfill for patients and caregivers and how people can affordably access the treatment; Company considerations – The costs of research, development, manufacturing and support services for customers; business trends and other economic factors; as well as the medicine’s potential market size, patent life and place within our larger portfolio of medicines; Competitive landscape –The benefits of our medicine compared to alternative medicines, where our medicine fits in treating conditions and existing contracts between payers and our competitors; Other external factors – Such as health system changes and policy guidelines."
,,,The way that medicines are paid for in the current health-care system may seem confusing.
,,,"In the U.S., here’s how we approach pricing our medicines: We set a list price for each of our medicines, taking into account the value provided to patients, affordability, the competitive landscape, research costs, manufacturing, marketing and support services provided, as well as other factors such as health system changes."
,,,"To expand patient access, we pay rebates and other discounts to payers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and other supply chain entities such as wholesalers and distributors."
,,,"After paying these rebates and discounts, the final dollar amount that Lilly ultimately receives is called the net price."
,,,We are committed to increasing transparency around the price of our medicines.
,,,"List prices for our medicines, as well as average out-of-pocket costs and financial assistance information are published here ."

,,,"It includes water used in processes, utilities, and other ancillary operations, such as irrigation."
,,,"The term does not include groundwater pumped solely for treatment to satisfy regulatory actions or requirements (e.g., remediation activities where the water is not used for another purpose)."
,,,Values do not include the water extracted from wells solely for the purpose of lowering the groundwater table(s) to maintain the physical and structural integrity of building foundations.
,,,Totals include a small amount of rainwater intake not included in other water intake subcategories.
,,,Lilly does not generally collect water data from small locations that house primarily administrative activities such as sales and marketing offices unless they are co-located at a Lilly manufacturing or research facility.
,,,Because currently Lilly does not have goals related to water intake there is no baseline year.
,,,"In 2018, Lilly met its 2020 goal of reducing phosphorus emissions to wastewater by 15% compared to the baseline year of 2014."
,,,We then set an additional 10% reduction goal using 2018 as the new baseline year and adjusted 2018 data for the divestiture of Lilly’s former subsidiary Elanco Animal Health in late 2018.
,,,"Because the initial goal was achieved, data for years prior to 2018 was not adjusted to reflect subsequent events and therefore is not comparable to data for the new goal period."
