"See also page 44.DEAR ABBOTT STAKEHOLDER, Sustainability is the fundamental challenge of our time.",ABT_2020.pdf
"And it grows continually more pressing, as the last year has demonstrated in so many ways.",ABT_2020.pdf
This is exactly the kind of challenge Abbott is built to address.,ABT_2020.pdf
Because thinking and acting for sustainability is inherent to our culture.,ABT_2020.pdf
"And it’s a natural extension of our purpose—helping people live healthier, fuller lives.",ABT_2020.pdf
We pursue this mission very deliberately through our business strategies and processes.,ABT_2020.pdf
Abbott always takes the long view.,ABT_2020.pdf
We’ve succeeded for more than 130 years because we work at it.,ABT_2020.pdf
"And we bring that same orientation—purpose-driven and achievement-focused—to our efforts to sustain not just our company, but our communities and the world around us.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Now well into the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott has been a significant contributor to the world’s progress against the disease, through the 12 different tests we’ve developed to identify the virus and help people live with greater safety and confidence.",ABT_2020.pdf
"But we want to do much better than the old “normal.” We’re setting our sights higher, aiming to do our part in helping society make real progress in meeting its most urgent needs and building a better, more resilient world for the century ahead.",ABT_2020.pdf
This is made very clear by our 2030 Sustainability Plan.,ABT_2020.pdf
"We conducted an exhaustive process, involving colleagues from across all parts of the company and around the world, to understand Abbott’s strengths and weaknesses, challenges and opportunities to create a 10-year plan that brings the company’s commitment to a new level.As this report demonstrates, Abbott remains a conscientious and effective contributor across the broad range of ESG priorities.",ABT_2020.pdf

"Using our primary expertise to help the world achieve greater total health at lower total cost is the most meaningful way we can contribute to the long-term sustainability of our society and our planet—helping more people than ever before live their best, healthiest and fullest lives.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Sincerely, ROBERT B. FORD President and Chief Executive OfficerFROM OUR PRESIDENT AND CEO ABBOTT 2020 GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT OVERVIEW / ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY / DATA / OUR PEOPLE / ENVIRONMENT / SUPPLY CHAIN / FOUNDATIONS / REPORTING / INDICESMeeting Unprecedented Demand As a global leader in medical diagnostics, Abbott understood from the start that COVID-19 would require a major mobilization on our part.",ABT_2020.pdf
"We quickly formed multiple research and development teams, who worked in parallel, to create a range of tools to detect the virus and its antibodies at every stage of infection.",ABT_2020.pdf
"To date, their efforts have resulted in 12 new tests for use in a broad range of applications, from high-throughput instruments capable of handling large volumes of tests at once, to rapid point-of-care testing delivering reliable, on-the-spot results, fast.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Early in the pandemic, with only limited information available about the virus, our scientists leveraged years of assay- development expertise to create a series of tests for both high-volume laboratories and doctors’ offices.",ABT_2020.pdf
"These included molecular tests, which help identify active infections, to run on our Alinity® m, m2000 RealTime® and ID NOWTM systems; and immunoassay tests for our Alinity i and ARCHITECT® platforms to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to the COVID-19 virus, which help identify late-stage and previous infections.",ABT_2020.pdf
"By the summer of 2020, we’d added to that portfolio with our BinaxNOWTM antigen test in the United States, and our PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid antigen test and Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid antibody test in countries outside the United States–rapid test devices that required no additional instrumentation to deliver results in minutes.",ABT_2020.pdf
"In April 2021, BinaxNOW received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use at home, without a prescription.",ABT_2020.pdf
As important as creating the tests themselves was the ability to produce them at massive scale to meet the critical need for ongoing testing.,ABT_2020.pdf
"So, we moved to increase our manufacturing capacity, quickly launching three new facilities, allowing us to deliver tens of millions of tests every month.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Beyond diagnostics, FreeStyle Libre 14-day system was made available for use by frontline healthcare workers in hospitals to remotely monitor patients with diabetes who can scan themselves, minimizing healthcare workers’ exposure to COVID-19.",ABT_2020.pdf
"And in our branded generic medicines business, we’ve seen a surge in demand for our vitamin C and vitamin D products as people seek to maintain good immune health.",ABT_2020.pdf
And our CentriMagTM Acute Circulatory Support System also made a significant difference.,ABT_2020.pdf
"Used in intensive care units around the world, the CentriMag System provides short-term life support for people whose hearts don’t pump enough blood to meet their body’s oxygen needs.With the rise of COVID-19, in April 2020, the FDA cleared devices like our CentriMag System to provide long-term heart and lung support to critical-care patients for the duration of the pandemic.",ABT_2020.pdf
"This led to an unprecedented demand for the product, which made rapidly scaling our global supply chain and establishing new production sites more important than ever before (see page 88).",ABT_2020.pdf
"Our ability to quickly and effectively respond to these unprecedented challenges helped Abbott thrive in 2020, ensuring our continued positive impact on the world.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Protecting Our People Around the World Because Abbott has been designated an essential business, we’ve been able to provide an uninterrupted supply of vital diagnostics, medical devices, medicines and nutritional products to our customers throughout the pandemic.",ABT_2020.pdf
"From the start, we made protecting of our employees’ health an essential condition of keeping our business operational.",ABT_2020.pdf
"We established an infrastructure to procure and distribute personal protective equipment (PPE) to employees, and we take several measures at our sites, including enhanced cleaning processes, wearing masks, temperature checks and implementing social distancing.COVID-19: AN ONGOING RESPONSE TO A GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS “With people like ours, and the robust supply chain we have, you get outcomes like we saw with the COVID response, where we can deliver meaningful, rapid and low-cost solutions to big problems.” Andrea Wainer, Executive Vice President, Rapid and Molecular Diagnostics 1 In the United States, we regularly test employees and contractors directly involved in manufacturing our COVID-19 tests and have expanded this testing to other facilities and offices across the country.",ABT_2020.pdf
"In late 2020, we began expanding testing to our manufacturing facilities in other countries as well.",ABT_2020.pdf
"In a number of countries in Latin America, we contracted with private bus companies to provide a safer commuting option for our colleagues who continued to work on-site.",ABT_2020.pdf
"We also sent regular “Great Leader” emails to managers, providing tips, resources and support to help them better manage and connect with their remote teams.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Caring for Our Colleagues As a result of the virus, we expanded employee assistance programs (EAPs) that offer health and wellness resources to at least 16 more of our country affiliates to provide: • Counseling services for physical, financial and emotional care • Ways to manage stress and anxiety during uncertainty • Local community resources, including where to find child care and elder care • Help with making the transition from working at home to back in the office In September 2020, we introduced new ways to make the remote learning experience better for both students and their parents in the United States.",ABT_2020.pdf
"We created several new benefits (and highlighted other existing programs) that employees could use to make life a little easier for child care or elder care, including backup care options.",ABT_2020.pdf
"At some of our locations where colleagues were continuing to work on-site, we partnered with our cafeteria providers to offer food staples and hard-to-get items.",ABT_2020.pdf
"We also delivered wellness kits to employees at U.S. sites and distributed more than 24,000 kits to colleagues across the globe.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Abbott has 109,000 employees in more than 160 countries, and we had no layoffs, furloughs or pay cuts in 2020 due to COVID-19.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Even in a few rare cases where we halted production for a week or so, employees were paid for their normal work schedule.",ABT_2020.pdf
We have been offering our colleagues flexible working hours to help them manage their home and work schedules.,ABT_2020.pdf
"We also helped our people get back to their home countries, and their families, when border closures and travel restrictions made that difficult.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Additionally, employees have also been able to take paid sick leave if they are ill or quarantined as a result of COVID-19.",ABT_2020.pdf
"For colleagues in the United States who took advantage of our program to buy extra vacation days, we gave them the option to reduce the extra days if they were unable to use them and reimbursed them accordingly.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Our Early Discoveries day care center at our Abbott Park headquarters developed new protocols that allowed it to safely remain open, providing child care for essential workers.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Additionally, we began offering child care and tutoring discounts through partner facilities, free memberships to Sittercity, help finding nannies, babysitters and online tutors, and two free hours of virtual on-demand tutoring per week.",ABT_2020.pdf
"The Clara Abbott Foundation, a not-for-profit organization managed and funded independently from Abbott, which exists solely to help Abbott employees and retirees who experience financial hardship, has provided financial grants to those struggling to afford basic needs because of increased expenses and/or loss of household income resulting from COVID-19.",ABT_2020.pdf
"We also implemented midyear dependent-care flexible spending account elections that allowed participants to make changes at any time, rather than only following a life event.",ABT_2020.pdf
"As the COVID-19 pandemic grew, and the full extent of its impact became clearer, Abbott people sprang into action, collaborating with partners around the world to mitigate that impact for our stakeholders in every way we could.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Because we hold Caring as a fundamental value, we take it as a point of pride that we treat the people who depend on us as if they’re our own family.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Early on, as some consumers began stockpiling goods, like infant formula, in anticipation of product shortages, Abbott stepped up to make sure that families with the greatest need could access our products.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Working with the nonprofit organization Feeding America, we provided Similac® infant formula—more than 1.7 million feedings—free of charge to food banks in hard-hit areas across the United States.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Beyond our donation to Feeding America, Abbott and our foundation, the Abbott Fund, continue to support relief efforts globally, providing millions in funding and products to help address key needs.",ABT_2020.pdf
"This includes working with relief partner organizations to provide frontline health workers with training and resources to advance testing and care, supporting families with needed supplies and information for the prevention and care of COVID-19, and helping meet critical local needs in communities where our employees live and work.COVID-19 RESPONSE: SUPPORTING FAMILIES IN NEED3 Comprehensive Approach to Battling a Virus The COVID-19 pandemic has not only posed new challenges; it has revealed weaknesses and limitations in the world’s health systems.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Communities already struggling with affordable access to healthcare, treatment and resources around the world are now all the more vulnerable.",ABT_2020.pdf
There is no one solution.,ABT_2020.pdf
That’s why we took a comprehensive approach that included partnerships and local expertise and targeted the most vulnerable populations.,ABT_2020.pdf
"In collaboration with the Abbott Fund, Abbott’s philanthropic foundation, we’ve given approximately $27 million in cash and product to support our communities and frontline workers across 63 countries.",ABT_2020.pdf

"Our Engineering and EHS policies and management standards consider chronic physical risks, such as water scarcity, and require sites to conduct regular risk and opportunity evaluations and implement mitigation strategies.",ABT_2020.pdf
"Our analyses of climate-related risks conclude that Abbott is not exposed to physical risks that could generate a substantive change in business operations, revenue or expenditure at a corporate level.",ABT_2020.pdf
Limited physical risks exist at site and regional operation levels and throughout our supply chain.,ABT_2020.pdf
"However, our diverse geographical distribution significantly mitigates the potential for substantive impact on our business.",ABT_2020.pdf
Our most significant climate-related risks are transition risks that relate to emerging expectations and regulations around businesses managing their GHG emissions.,ABT_2020.pdf
"These risks include carbon limits and taxes, enhanced emissions-reporting obligations, costs to transition to lower-emissions technologies, and increased costs of goods and services.",ABT_2020.pdf
We have identified the need to manage and mitigate environmental impacts as a potential enterprise risk for Abbott.,ABT_2020.pdf
"In response to this, Abbott’s business strategy includes reducing the energy and carbon footprint of our operations and engaging our value chain in strategic sourcing categories.",ABT_2020.pdf
"For more information on our management of, and progress in, addressing specific climate-related risks, see Reducing Energy and Emissions ( page 67), Protecting Water Resources ( page 72 ) and Extended Producer Responsibility ( page 77).Opportunities As part of our product research and development (R&D) and climate risk management processes, we consider opportunities that might result from climate change.",ABT_2020.pdf
These fall into two main categories: increased operating efficiencies as a result of achieving carbon reduction targets and the opportunity to advance our mission to help people live their best lives by meeting changing healthcare and nutrition needs.,ABT_2020.pdf
"Compared with many industries, Abbott’s carbon footprint is relatively small, and our success in exceeding our 2020 carbon reduction target means that we have fewer opportunities to realize significant operating efficiencies and cost savings in the future.",ABT_2020.pdf

"In 2021, 25 of our manufacturing sites were identified as operating in areas of water stress.",ABT_2021.pdf
"Of those, 48% used less than 15 million gallons of water while nine sites were deemed high impact considering basin water stress, basin water depletion level and water usage.",ABT_2021.pdf
"Aligned with our context-based approach and based on the potential for these sites to significantly impact local communities, we have targeted them for AWS water stewardship certification.",ABT_2021.pdf
"Alignment with the standard is intended to achieve five main outcomes: • • Good water governance • • Sustainable water balance • • Good water quality status • • Important water-related areas • • Safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) We have established a Community of Practice for our nine High Water Impact Sites to support progress toward AWS water stewardship certification.",ABT_2021.pdf
Strategic roadmaps highlight key steps for achieving certification.Water Stewardship Management Practices We will implement accredited water stewardship management practices in more than 75% of all manufacturing sites operating in water-stressed regions by 2030.,ABT_2021.pdf
"In 2021, we set this in motion for 16 sites identified as being in water-stressed areas not classified as being high water impact.",ABT_2021.pdf
"While these sites have less impact than our high water impact facilities, it is also important for them to adopt water stewardship practices that support achievement of the outcomes described above.",ABT_2021.pdf
Draft accredited water stewardship practices are currently under expert review.,ABT_2021.pdf
They will be finalized in 2022 alongside a supporting guidance document.,ABT_2021.pdf

The idea of sustainability — of how we build better systems to support the long-term welfare of our society and our planet — has rarely been brought to public life and discourse with such power and urgency.,ABT_2019.pdf
Our company exists to help people live their fullest lives.,ABT_2019.pdf
Implicit in this purpose is the recognition that all people — all people — deserve the opportunity to thrive.,ABT_2019.pdf
"To us at Abbott, that means health — primarily the better physical health that we help people achieve through our products and technologies.",ABT_2019.pdf
But we recognize that thriving requires health in multiple dimensions.,ABT_2019.pdf
Environmental degradation is a public health challenge.,ABT_2019.pdf
Racial inequity is a public health challenge.,ABT_2019.pdf
Social disparity is a public health challenge.,ABT_2019.pdf
And we’re dedicated to addressing needs at all of these levels.,ABT_2019.pdf
"In our core mission of creating life-changing healthcare technologies, we’ve risen to the challenges of this year.",ABT_2019.pdf
"Thus far, Abbott has produced five different tests to help in the fight against COVID-19, and our work on this urgent need continues.",ABT_2019.pdf
"At the same time, we’ve continued to advance our work in the other critical areas of healthcare in which we have technological leadership, such as diabetes and heart disease.",ABT_2019.pdf
And we’re committed to designing new products for maximum affordability and accessibility for the people who need them.,ABT_2019.pdf
"In terms of environmental health, we continue to work to reduce our impact through improvements in water use, packaging, waste generation and emissions.",ABT_2019.pdf
"And in terms of social and health equity, we’re working in partnership with communities and governments around the world to improve access to health information and care through programs such as the rural health center model we’ve established with the government of Rwanda and our Future WellTM programs, which address social determinants of health and help educate kids about noncommunicable diseases and how to decrease their chances of getting them.",ABT_2019.pdf
"Our 2030 Sustainability Plan, which we’re introducing later this year, will lay out our goals and efforts across these areas at greater length.",ABT_2019.pdf
At the foundation of our work and our culture at Abbott is the recognition that all our lives are intertwined and that we have commitments to one another.,ABT_2019.pdf
That understanding gives us purpose and makes us stronger.,ABT_2019.pdf

Technology is advancing at a pace we have not seen before and is fast becoming a natural part of how we manage our health.,ABT_2019.pdf
"We see a near future in which implantables, wearables and diagnostics data, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), come together seamlessly, altering how people manage healthcare in an increasingly self-directed way.",ABT_2019.pdf
These trends create the potential for new entrants to disrupt the diagnostics industry and restate the competitive landscape.,ABT_2019.pdf
"Devices and applications that aid in prevention, early stage detection and management of health issues are becoming prolific.",ABT_2019.pdf
"Consumer access to data and products that are highly tailored to individuals and their needs not only allows people to have a larger say in the management of their health, but it also can result in faster, more accurate diagnoses and better compliance with treatment plans.",ABT_2019.pdf
"Technology leaders, such as Apple, Amazon and Google, all have announced initiatives that are disrupting the traditional healthcare business model and allowing consumers to leverage technology to self-diagnose before seeking traditional healthcare providers.",ABT_2019.pdf
"As patient-driven healthcare expands and the use of direct-to-consumer devices for managing health increases, Abbott, as well as other healthcare companies, is evolving some traditional products and services to meet changing customer needs.",ABT_2019.pdf
Our products must keep pace with these expectations.,ABT_2019.pdf
"Additionally, our industry must be faster at bringing to market emerging technologies in order to maintain leadership and growth amidst the backdrop of nontraditional technology competitors with strong consumer engagement.",ABT_2019.pdf
"To remain competitive, we need to continue innovating new technologies that are science-driven, consumer- friendly and relevant in the changing model of healthcare.",ABT_2019.pdf
We benchmark ourselves against both technology and health companies.,ABT_2019.pdf
We’re focused on innovations in health that fit easily into a person’s life.,ABT_2019.pdf
"One focus of ours is on connected sensor technology and smaller, less-invasive devices that have the potential to replace medicines as the first or only line of defense.",ABT_2019.pdf
"For people with diabetes, for example, our FreeStyle Libre® continuous glucose monitoring system uses a sensor that can be scanned using a smartphone.",ABT_2019.pdf
This lets patients track glucose levels without sticking their fingers.,ABT_2019.pdf
"Our insertable cardiac monitor — the size of a paperclip, inserted just below the skin in the chest through a quick outpatient procedure — monitors heart rate and rhythm and connects people with their doctors to more accurately detect and diagnose irregular heartbeats.",ABT_2019.pdf
"The changing landscape of healthcare poses new opportunities, as traditional healthcare and technology companies work to improve care for patients.",ABT_2019.pdf
Increased collaboration may be the key to success.,ABT_2019.pdf
We believe technology companies can learn much from the healthcare industry and vice versa.,ABT_2019.pdf

"Our sales presence in more than 150 countries, with no country making up a disproportionate share of revenues, also provides insulation from a localized demand shock.",ABT_2019.pdf
"In addition, from a supply perspective, Abbott’s network of 92 owned manufacturing plants in more than 25 countries — plus many more third-party manufacturers — ensures that localized disruptions are unlikely to materially impact our ability to supply our critical products to the patients and consumers who need them.Our diagnostic capabilities also play a critical role in pandemic response.",ABT_2019.pdf
"Abbott has long been a leader in infectious disease testing, including the development of the first HIV test in 1985.",ABT_2019.pdf
"Additionally, we recognize that addressing a pandemic requires different diagnostic solutions for the different stages of infection and recovery (as well as maximizing the venues available for testing).",ABT_2019.pdf

"When her fifth grade class went on a field trip to a local college and shadowed engineering students, she realized it was possible to build a career following her passions.",ABT_2019.pdf
"After spending the day learning the importance of engineering and participating in problem-solving exercises, she was hooked.",ABT_2019.pdf
Jomi’s journey from her native Nigeria to that day had not always been an easy one.,ABT_2019.pdf
"Her parents, both successful in scientific fields in their home country, felt that they needed to raise their daughter in the United States to afford her the advanced education she would need for a career that allowed her to work anywhere in the world.",ABT_2019.pdf
Her family moved to Minnesota when Jomi was four years old and the changes were immediate.,ABT_2019.pdf
"“I came from an area where everyone looked like me, sounded like me, to here where everyone treated me differently because they didn’t know much about me or where I came from,” Jomi said.",ABT_2019.pdf
"“A lot of times I felt looked down upon, or dumber, because I came from another country.",ABT_2019.pdf
I wasn’t picked for classroom groups.,ABT_2019.pdf
"Because people just didn’t know.”Over time, however, her teachers started to notice and believe in her and her talents.",ABT_2019.pdf
"By the start of middle school, she was determined to sharpen her math and science skills.",ABT_2019.pdf
"“My favorite part of school was getting a problem and working in a group to find a solution,” Jomi said.",ABT_2019.pdf
"She continued to concentrate on improving her science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills as she entered high school, even though she still believed that engineering careers were limited to the types of people she had met on her field trip years earlier.All of that changed when she was 15.",ABT_2019.pdf
She began studying with a college prep class tutor who shared her enthusiasm for engineering because he was an engineer himself.,ABT_2019.pdf
"“He worked with me not to pass a test, but because he wanted me to ‘get it,’ so I would look forward to learning more and incorporating it into my career,” Jomi explained.",ABT_2019.pdf
The final piece was put in place when a group of African American biomedical engineers came to her college prep class.,ABT_2019.pdf
"“They explained what they did, how they got into it and their values seemed similar to mine.",ABT_2019.pdf
"They showed me that someone who looked like me could do the job,” she said.",ABT_2019.pdf
"A year later, Jomi is pursuing her dream as a biomedical engineering intern at Abbott.",ABT_2019.pdf
"In 2019, Abbott created a one-of-a-kind STEM Internship Blueprint, a resource for businesses looking to increase diversity in STEM through high school internships.",ABT_2019.pdf
"To Jomi, being an engineer means making people’s lives better on a day-to-day basis, trusting in herself and others to “make the world a better place.",ABT_2019.pdf

"With the FreeStyle Libre system, she did not need to prick her finger1 when running.",ABT_2018.pdf
"Instead, she waved a handheld device over a sensor about the size of two stacked quarters worn on the back of her upper arm.",ABT_2018.pdf
"Her glucose measurement immediately appeared on the device reader, along with information about how her glucose had been trending and where it was forecasted to go.",ABT_2018.pdf
"This life-changing technology gave her the confidence to know what was going on with the glucose in her body throughout her race, helping her to accomplish yet another extraordinary feat.From the beginning, we have worked to provide broad access to the FreeStyle Libre system in countries around the world.",ABT_2018.pdf
The system reduces users from having to pay for test strips that are typically used for routine blood glucose self-monitoring1.,ABT_2018.pdf
"In 2018, Abbott presented data that showed FreeStyle Libre users saw savings of more than $120 a month by eliminating the cost of test strips2.",ABT_2018.pdf
"We also work with governments around the world to qualify the system for government reimbursement, making the device more accessible for people who could most benefit.",ABT_2018.pdf

"Check sensor glucose readings with a blood glucose meter when Check Blood Glucose symbol appears, when symptoms do not match system readings, or when readings are suspected to be inaccurate.",ABT_2018.pdf
"The system does not have alarms unless the sensor is scanned, and the system contains small parts that may be dangerous if swallowed.",ABT_2018.pdf
"The system is not approved for pregnant women, persons on dialysis, or critically-ill population.",ABT_2018.pdf
Sensor placement is not approved for sites other than the back of the arm and standard precautions for transmission of blood borne pathogens should be taken.,ABT_2018.pdf
"The built-in blood glucose meter is not for use on dehydrated, hypotensive, in shock, hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar state, with or without ketosis, neonates, critically-ill patients, or for diagnosis or screening of diabetes.",ABT_2018.pdf
