Investment in research and development (R&D) is critical to driving our future growth.,HOLX_2022.pdf
"Hologic's longstanding commitment to R&D across all divisions is clear: we've invested nearly $1.9 billion globally over the past eight years, including approximately $282 million in 2022.",HOLX_2022.pdf
"Hologic’s R&D pipeline remains robust, with strong product launches including our BV and CV/TV Aptima® assays, which diagnose 90% of vaginitis cases including bacterial vaginosis (BV), candidiasis (CV) and trichomonas vaginalis (TV).",HOLX_2022.pdf
"Vaginitis remains the leading reason why millions of women visit their OB/GYN each year, making the Aptima® BV and CV/TV assays a game-changer in women's health.",HOLX_2022.pdf
What sparked the idea for these assays?,HOLX_2022.pdf
Hologic is committed to developing innovative technology grounded in evidence and clinical data.,HOLX_2022.pdf
This is how we deliver the best results for our patients.,HOLX_2022.pdf
Vaginitis is a complex health issue impacting millions of women and can result in a long journey for patients seeking answers to their vaginal symptoms and discomfort.,HOLX_2022.pdf
It’s incredibly personal.,HOLX_2022.pdf
"Many women feel embarrassed, self-conscious and frustrated by their symptoms.",HOLX_2022.pdf
New methods for diagnosing vaginitis infections were needed.,HOLX_2022.pdf
We developed these assays over a multi-year period that began by establishing close relationships with experts in microbiology and clinical medicine from around the world.,HOLX_2022.pdf
"We used these insights to develop our Aptima® BV and Aptima® CV/TV molecular assays, allowing for a more accurate vaginitis diagnosis, which is essential to treat and help reduce the potential for recurrent or persistent infections.",HOLX_2022.pdf
Why is it so important for women to get tested for BV and CV/TV?,HOLX_2022.pdf
Diagnosis can be especially complicated due to the prevalence of co-infections.,HOLX_2022.pdf
"For example, one in five patients with symptoms of vaginitis have two causes of vaginitis.",HOLX_2022.pdf
"Accurate diagnosis is complicated by the subjective nature of traditional methods, which often leads to misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment.",HOLX_2022.pdf
The inclination for many women to self-diagnose and self-treat before seeking treatment from their healthcare provider further exacerbates the problem.,HOLX_2022.pdf
"When left untreated, these infections can put women at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease or other fertility-related complications.",HOLX_2022.pdf
"Therefore, it is particularly important for providers to accurately identify and treat the underlying cause of vaginitis symptoms.",HOLX_2022.pdf
"Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) offer a more objective, comprehensive and accurate method for diagnosing the cause of vaginitis compared to traditional methods.What does the future look like for BV and CV/TV testing?",HOLX_2022.pdf
"In 2021, the CDC updated its STI Treatment Guidelines .",HOLX_2022.pdf
The guidelines now note that vaginitis can be diagnosed by NAATs to detect the underlying cause of infection of vaginitis in symptomatic women.,HOLX_2022.pdf
We are encouraged that the CDC is reinforcing the value of these molecular assays and hope it will foster faster adoption among clinicians.,HOLX_2022.pdf
We look forward to more healthcare providers and laboratories using these CDC-recommended assays to offer better clinical management for their patients.,HOLX_2022.pdf

"Since 2018, when the Costa Rica site initially installed solar panels, the team has harnessed the power of solar electricity to deliver environmental benefits and financial savings.",HOLX_2022.pdf
"For example, these solar panels have reduced the facility’s carbon footprint by 25.5 tons of CO 2 per year; saving the equivalent of 8,000 trees, while also saving approximately $71,000 per year in electricity costs.",HOLX_2022.pdf
"Given these outstanding benefits, in June of 2022, the Costa Rica team chose to expand its solar panel capacity.",HOLX_2022.pdf
"We expect the new panels to generate 220 kilowatts (kW) of power at maximum capacity, which represents more than 456 thousand kilowatt-hours (kWh) of power per year, equivalent to the average annual consumption of more than 200 houses in Costa Rica.",HOLX_2022.pdf
"The facility is also implementing a battery system to save and store electricity generated during periods of low energy usage, with a goal to offset activity during periods of peak energy consumption.",HOLX_2022.pdf
These initiatives are part our global strategy to achieve a 40% reliance on self-generated renewable energy at Hologic-owned sites by 2030.,HOLX_2022.pdf
"Water Reclamation In addition to expanding solar panel capacity and introducing an efficient battery system, Hologic Costa Rica’s tremendous commitment to sustainability is evidenced by the team’s water reclamation project.",HOLX_2022.pdf
The team has created an ingenious solution to collect rainwater from the facility’s roof and reuse it in the site’s air conditioning system.,HOLX_2022.pdf
"With the project, Hologic Costa Rica expects to save more than 1,500 cubic meters of rainwater annually and save $4,700.00 USD in annual air conditioning costs.",HOLX_2022.pdf

"But in the face of all this uncertainty, the way we responded was also unprecedented and differentiated.",HOLX_2020.pdf
There was no playbook to address the challenges we faced.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"Our actions were deliberate and thoughtful, but sometimes unconventional.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"For example, in our diagnostics division, our leadership team and employees came into work every day—they had to in order to develop our tests and scale up production.",HOLX_2020.pdf

And our commitment to women’s health remains inviolable.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"But throughout 2020, we added another chapter to our already rich history by playing an indisputable and vital role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the worst public health crisis most of us have ever experienced—and hopefully ever will.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Although we developed the first FDA-cleared molecular diagnos - tic test decades ago, and built tremendous scientific expertise in infectious disease detection, we had always been somewhat of a niche player in the broader diagnostics industry.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"But when the pandemic hit, and it became clear that massive amounts of coronavirus testing would be needed to save lives and safely re-open economies, we were prepared for the moment.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"We developed two highly accurate molecular tests in a matter of months, a process that would normally take years.",HOLX_2020.pdf
And we more than doubled total molecular diagnostic production capacity—a process that would normally take eight to 10 years—in roughly six months.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"Based on these efforts, in calendar 2020 we distributed approximately 68 million COVID tests to customers in 40 countries, Steve MacMillan, Chairman, President and CEO 2020 Hologic Sustainability Report 3 Introduction The Globe Culture & Society Governance 2 2020 Hologic Sustainability Report quite literally enabling healthier lives everywhere, every day.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Given the unprecedented demand for our products, our goal was always to communicate available supply to our customers without overpromising, which helped us build credibility and set the stage for future business growth.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"We were able to make such a huge impact against COVID-19 because, over the last several years, we had installed nearly 2,000 Panther® instruments, on which our molecular tests run, in all 50 U.S. states and around the world.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Because of their sophisticated automation, each Panther system can generate more than 1,000 test results in a 24-hour period, making them critical tools for high-volume COVID testing.",HOLX_2020.pdf

Our response to the pandemic also generated substantial benefits for our shareholders.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"By responding aggressively to the unprecedented public health need, we generated more than $900 million in sales of our COVID tests in fiscal 2020, and clearly demonstrated our ability to “do well by doing good.” It’s never been more clear that the greater impact we have on the world, the better we do financially.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Setting the Stage for Our Pandemic Response We believe that the way we treated our employees in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic set the stage for the incredible contributions they made later in the year, and will continue contributing to stellar performance in the future.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Before we had developed our own tests to detect SARS-CoV-2, revenue in our other businesses fell off a cliff as hospitals cut back elective procedures, and consumers skipped regular screenings and checkups because of the pandemic.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In response, we acted quickly to reduce costs and preserve cash.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Our approach was to preserve as many jobs as possible, and to lead from the top.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Rather than laying off employees outright, we implemented reduced work weeks, temporary plant shutdowns and furloughs depending on local business needs.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"We reduced compensation for our salaried employees: 50% for the Board of Directors and for myself, 25% for our Global Leadership Team, and 10% for other levels.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"But at the same time, we preserved funding for our retirement plans, and back-stopped sales teams whose compensation could have been cut by 80% or more based on circumstances beyond their control.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Fortunately, as sales of our SARS-CoV-2 tests increased, we were able to reinstate compensation and begin returning our manufac- turing facilities to regular operations within about three months.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"And later in the year, we were able to “pay back” employees for their lost compensation.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"For the frontline employees who came to work every day to develop and manufacture our COVID tests, or who installed new Panther instruments in locked-down hospitals during the most uncertain times of the pandemic, we were able to provide extraordinary financial awards.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Specifically, we redirected about 30% of our fiscal year-end bonus pool to these employees, many of whom received eight to ten times their normal bonus as a result.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"We believe all these actions are contributing to improved perfor - mance today, as our non-COVID businesses recover more rapidly than expected, and as we gain market share in multiple segments.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Advancing Healthcare Equality As if the COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t bad enough, another major issue that reared its ugly head in the United States in 2020 was social and racial inequality.The murder of George Floyd and other examples of racism in 2020 touched many of us at Hologic, including me.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"As someone with a Black stepfather, I’ve seen firsthand the pernicious effects of systemic racism.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Internally, we’ve always taken a different approach to diversity is - sues.",HOLX_2020.pdf

"In fact, I consider myself our chief diversity officer, and in this role, my job is to create a culture in which every employee can achieve his or her full potential.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Rather than creating formal diversity programs, we strive to increase diversity by using objective tools to hire the most talented person for every open position, then we coach and develop them aggressively.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"This approach yielded good results in 2020, especially at senior levels.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"When our longtime Breast Health president Pete Valenti retired, we changed our structure and promoted three internal executives to our Global Leadership Team.",HOLX_2020.pdf
One was a Black man and another a White woman—and all three were developed and promoted from within.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"More Women’s Health Leadership to Come Externally, we have a responsibility to ensure that people of all genders and races, with varying levels of socioeconomic resources, have equal opportunities to benefit from our products.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"But unfortunately, the healthcare needs of women and minorities are often overlooked by society.",HOLX_2020.pdf
We are striving to change this in three main ways: Partnerships.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"By collaborating with like-minded nonprofits and patient advocacy groups, we have promoted health equality through grants, direct-to-consumer educational and awareness campaigns, and research projects.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"For example, we have partnered with the Clinton Health Access Initiative and others to provide resource-limited countries in Africa with a single, reduced price for our viral load assays and, most recently, COVID-19 tests.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In addition, in 2020 we launched Project Health Equality, a multi-year, multimillion-dollar commitment to improve access to our lifesaving early detection products among minorities and lower income women.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"As a first step, we are partnering with the Black Women’s Health Imperative, RAD-AID and Grammy award-winning artist Mary J. Blige to decrease breast cancer screening disparities among Black women, who are almost 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer than non-Hispanic white women.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In addition, we plan to expand our efforts to help reduce the rates of cervical cancer, with more areas still to come.",HOLX_2020.pdf
Philanthropy.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"Given our outstanding financial results in fiscal 2020, we donated $15 million to our corporate charitable fund, the largest donations we have ever made by far.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Over the next several years, we intend to use this money to support causes and issues that are close to Hologic’s mission and near to many of our hearts.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Specifically, we plan to increase the charitable donations we already make to nonprofit organizations focused on women’s health and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education, as well as expand our giving to groups focused on social and racial justice.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In addition, based on the belief that education is the key to social equality, we created two scholarship programs focused on lower income and first-generation college students—one for the families of Company employees, and another for nonprofit groups near our facilities that provide college readiness programs.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Finally, we instituted a limited “matching program” to magnify the impact that our employees’ donations have in their communities.",HOLX_2020.pdf
Policy.,HOLX_2020.pdf
Persistent gaps in women’s health equality are often tied to legislation and policy.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"Understanding this, we have played a proactive role in advocating for insurance coverage for our inno - vative products.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"For example, we supported the Protect Access to Lifesaving Screenings (PALS) Act to ensure that as many women as possible have access to mammography screening.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In addition to this and many other initiatives, we are pursuing our Passion to become global champions of women’s health in a unique, groundbreaking way.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"We are excited to be partnering with Gallup, the leading analytics and advice firm, to conduct the world’s first comprehensive study of women’s health.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In this landmark study, approximately 120,000 people in 115 countries are answering a series of questions that will establish the Hologic Global Women’s Health Index, the first study to definitively track women’s health by country and over time.",HOLX_2020.pdf
We have made a long-term commitment to this project so that we can provide government leaders and policy makers valuable data and actionable insights to improve women’s health in their countries.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"Stay tuned for more information on this exciting project this year, and in our next sustainability report.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In conclusion, the challenges of 2020 enabled us to make a bigger, more profound impact on the world than we ever imagined.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"At the same time, our successes helped us refine how we want to operate as an organization in pursuit of our Purpose, Passion and Promise.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"By having the courage to make decisions that sometimes appeared unconventional, we played an integral role in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, while continuing to be a leader in women’s health.",HOLX_2020.pdf

"Sincerely, Barbara Eaton (holding the letter “O”) and her R&D team that worked on the Aptima® SARS-CoV-2 assay following an FDA submission at 3:00 a.m. on May 2nd, a tired but very happy team of scientists sent this selfie to numerous colleagues who contributed to our SARS-CoV-2 assay development.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"2020 Hologic Sustainability Report 5 4 2020 Hologic Sustainability Report Introduction The Globe Culture & Society GovernanceIn early December 2019, Hologic scientists, along with the rest of the world, began to hear of a strange new coronavirus spreading in the Wuhan area of China.",HOLX_2020.pdf
Speculation began about how far the virus might spread and what Hologic’s response would be.,HOLX_2020.pdf
Some R&D scientists began to work on what a potential test might look like and tinker with design questions.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"On January 8, 2020, after the genetic sequence of the virus was made available to the scientific community, work began in earnest.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"First, our computational team ran analytics that pointed to the best regions to target in the virus’s genetic sequence, and the design team followed up to produce optimal probe and primer designs.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"The decision was made to pursue a test for Panther Fusion®, the upgrade module for Panther that was launched in 2017.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Because of software features unique to Panther Fusion, design would be quick, and it was believed that many physicians would request an influenza test to be run alongside a COVID test, and respiratory virus panels were already available for the Panther Fusion system.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“The initial design was rapid—and we had our first prototypes ready after only a week or two of crunching data,” said Maurice Exner, vice president, R&D, assay development and clinical affairs.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“The hard work to follow was figuring out if the test would work as planned, as well as how to make it in large quantities.” As the weeks progressed, the work intensified.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In February, as Americans were getting early glimpses into the potential scale of the problem, Hologic R&D scientists were starting to take catnaps in conference rooms, setting alarms in order to pull data and keep instruments running round the clock.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Formal submission of the Panther Fusion assay to the U.S. FDA occurred just before 2 a.m. on Saturday, March 14.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"The FDA was also working round the clock, as by that time New York and New Jersey hospitals were overwhelmed, the World Health Organization had officially declared a pandemic, epidemiol - ogists were publishing models showing the potential scale of U.S. infections, and California was going into lockdown.",HOLX_2020.pdf
Hologic’s test received an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA on March 16—less than 48 hours after submission.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"“Our teams were thrilled, of course,” said Exner.",HOLX_2020.pdf
“But there wasn’t a lot of downtime to celebrate.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"We got right to work on a second assay.” The Panther Fusion test was immediately put to use in clinical lab - oratories across the country, but had a couple of limitations.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"First, there were about 200 Panther Fusion modules in use globally at the time, versus almost 2,000 Panther instruments.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Second, the manufacturing capacity for these tests was limited compared to other assays Hologic produces.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"And although 600,000 tests per month was an impressive number, it was already clear many more would be needed.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Once again, Hologic R&D, manufacturing and regulatory affairs teams were working at a furious pace, collapsing what is typically a two-year process to two months.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"The Aptima® SARS-CoV-2 assay was cleared for use in both the U.S. and Europe in May 2020, and by December 31, 2020, Hologic had shipped approximately 68 million tests.",HOLX_2020.pdf
Ingenuity in the Face of Challenges Hologic—and the diagnostics industry as a whole—met a number of challenges through the early months of the pandemic.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"First, testing across the country was slowed by a shortage of the swabs needed to collect samples from the nose or throat, as well as the transport media used to stabilize specimens for transit from doctors’ offices to clinical laboratories.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In the face of this issue, Hologic’s teams realized that they had a solution near at hand—the kits typically used for collection and transport of specimens for other kinds of testing, such as for sexually transmitted infections.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Millions of the Aptima specimen transfer tubes were in stock, and all other diagnostic testing had come to a crawl.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Immediately, the team incorporated use of these transfer tubes into the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay design and when Emergency Use Authorization was obtained in May, they were part of Hologic’s latest COVID-19 test, alleviating a major roadblock.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"But even as testing ramped up, demand also escalated very quickly.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In early August 2020, the FDA endorsed the concept of pooling samples to accelerate testing, and based on the excellent sensitivity of our tests.",HOLX_2020.pdf
Hologic became the first manufacturer to develop a pooling protocol.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"This protocol enables laboratory customers to pool up to five samples in one tube, using either an Aptima or Panther Fusion test.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"A negative result indicates that all five individuals are clear of infection; if the result is positive, the samples are individually tested.",HOLX_2020.pdf
All Hands on Deck Hologic production lines themselves have also been multiplying.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"Construction at our San Diego facility has been ongoing since January, and tens of millions of dollars have been invested in capital equipment to expand production capacity.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"This investment includes installation of new high-speed filling lines, as well as new, custom machinery to produce more of the highly specialized parts unique to our sample tubes and test kits.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In the spring and summer of 2020, more than 150 new operations employees were hired in San Diego, representing a more than 50% increase in that work force.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"While these new hires were being recruited and trained, employee volunteers from teams including information services and finance were trained to work on the packaging lines.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In June, full manufacturing of our new COVID-19 tests was initiated at our facility in Manchester, United Kingdom, which is now mainly supplying European markets.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Both manufacturing plants are operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, cranking out millions of tests to meet the unprece - dented need.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“In total, we succeeded in doubling our overall manufacturing capacity for molecular tests in six months, a process that would normally take about 10 years,” said David Tyler, vice president, operations manufacturing.",HOLX_2020.pdf

"During each of the last several years, Hologic placed approximately 220 new Panther systems globally.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In the third quarter of 2020 alone, 208 systems were installed.",HOLX_2020.pdf
Increasing the installed base was achieved through several measures.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"First, Hologic’s manufacturing partner Stratec, headquartered in Germany, was able to significantly expand their production capacity.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"Second, our service team and engineers within Hologic set out to locate and refurbish out-of-use instruments.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"A number of these had been used by R&D teams but replaced by newer instruments.“Basically, we scoured our campus for every Panther instrument we could track down and get into a customer’s hands,” said Ty Scott, vice president, customer experience and field service.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“In an average year, we typically refurbish one or two instruments per month.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In the summer of 2020, we increased our monthly output to 24-30 refurbished instruments and shipped out nearly a hundred by year end.” Scott’s teams worked nearly round the clock, taking calls from international customers and working side by side with Hologic engineers to assess and repair instruments.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“We’ve never seen such demand,” said Scott.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“It’s really a testament to the performance of the Panther platform.”As of December 2020, approximately 2,400 Panther systems had been installed worldwide, the most extensive network of any high-throughput molecular diagnostics system.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“The number of placements and demand for more instruments speak not only to the urgent need for COVID testing, but also to our long-term leadership in the molecular diagnostics space, and that is based on listening to the customer,” said Matt Friedenberg, vice president, instrumentation engineering.",HOLX_2020.pdf
“I have people on my team who have been here for 15 years or more.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"Some of them worked on the original Tigris® instrument, taking all customer feed - back very seriously.",HOLX_2020.pdf
The entire team comes in every day thinking about how to improve our instruments and make life easier for the lab technicians running these critical tests.” Helping with Ultrasound and Masks Diagnostic tests have not been Hologic’s only contribution during the COVID-19 pandemic.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"A wireless, low-cost and easy-to-sterilize ultrasound device marketed by the Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions Division for imaging of breast tumors also turned out to have use in COVID diagnoses.",HOLX_2020.pdf
The handheld Viera devices were used in hospitals in regions that were highly impacted early in the pandemic to assist with quickly triaging patients exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus infection.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"Carried as easily as a cellphone, the system enables quick imaging without any X-ray shielding required.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"In just two weeks, Hologic teams created an outreach campaign to healthcare providers, shared relevant research with them and answered questions from prospective customers.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“In mildly symptomatic cases, ultrasound can reveal lung changes that would predispose certain patients to becoming more ill,” said Dr. Susan Harvey, vice president of global medical affairs, Breast & Skeletal Health Division.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“If patients are admitted to the hospital, ultrasound can help determine whether lung changes are progressing or regressing, indicating whether a person needs to go to the ICU or if they can go home.” One item in short supply early on in the pandemic was face masks.",HOLX_2020.pdf
Hologic teams heading into operating rooms and doctors’ offices during the spring did not want to be drawing down supplies for medical workers.,HOLX_2020.pdf
Engineers in the Surgical Division hit on an ingenious solution—masks crafted from a unique material used within the NovaSure® endometrial ablation device.,HOLX_2020.pdf
The NovaSure device delivers ablation energy through a specialized elastic yarn.,HOLX_2020.pdf
The mechanical and biocompatible properties of that yarn enabled Hologic engineers to custom design a knitting pattern that balanced user comfort and performance.,HOLX_2020.pdf
"Hologic’s research and development engineers prototyped various designs, devoting a portion of the NovaSure production line in Costa Rica into a devoted face mask manufacturing area.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"To date, the project has produced more than 15,000 masks between June and December, helping protect our sales representatives, clinical applica - tions specialists, field service engineers and other frontline employees.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“The face mask project arose from versatile innovation, international col - laboration and a determined passion to counter the novel coronavirus in as many ways as possible,” said Gerardo Delgado, principal R&D engineer for Hologic’s Surgical Division.",HOLX_2020.pdf
"“All of us feel grateful for the chance to contribute to people’s wellbeing during this especially challenging time.”Left: Two Hologic Costa Rica team members, (left) Katherine Arce and (right) Karla Arrieta, working on the face mask project.",HOLX_2020.pdf

"In fiscal 2020, more than 1.5 million tests were shipped under GAI.",HOLX_2020.pdf

"We are proud of the progress we have made on ESG priorities over the last several years, excited about the many opportunities still ahead, and eager to tell you more in this report.",HOLX_2021.pdf
We believe we have a unique and compelling story to share.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"But before we get into that, I wanted to discuss one of my pet peeves — false choices, also sometimes called false dilemmas or false dichotomies.",HOLX_2021.pdf
You know what I’m talking about.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"Someone presents only two choices, and claims that one must be true, and the other false.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"These logical fallacies — you’re either for us, or you’re against us — are problematic because they oversimplify choices by excluding many viable options.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"These statements have become altogether too common in today’s polarized political environment, especially when they’re amplified by those who are unconcerned with civil debate: if you like candidate ______, you must be a ______.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"So what does this have to do with Hologic’s sustainability efforts, or ESG investing?",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Unfortunately, false choices are creeping into business as well – many expect CEOs to choose between the short-term and the long-term.",HOLX_2021.pdf
Or between purpose and profits.,HOLX_2021.pdf
Or between people and profits.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"But at Hologic, we don’t believe we have to choose.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"In fact, our unique purpose compels us to manage the Company to grow in both the short term and the long term, for the collective benefit of customers, patients, employees and shareholders.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"To us, this is what sustainability is all about.We crystallized this perspective back in 2019, when I wrote in our proxy letter that, “We have a fundamental obligation to create value for shareholders through profitable, long-term growth.",HOLX_2021.pdf
But this cannot be the whole story.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"To focus solely on financial outcomes would be to ignore the multifaceted, instrumental role that corporations play in our world.” In that same letter, I quoted Russell Pearlman of the Korn Ferry Institute, who said, “purpose and profit not only peacefully co-exist, but purpose can drive profit.” Later that year, the Business Roundtable published its seminal “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation.” Importantly, the statement does not rank various constituencies or prioritize one versus another.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Instead it says, “ Each of our stakeholders is essential.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"We commit to deliver value to all of them , for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.” More recently, Dick Patton and German Herrera expanded on this theme in discussing the Egon Zehnder report “It Starts with the CEO,” which involved nearly 1,000 global CEOs.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"They wrote, “[CEOs] are being asked to expand their leadership role to embrace a far wider group of stakeholders, demanding more than just strong financial results.",HOLX_2021.pdf
So leaders really need to break away from an either/or approach and boldly tackle the realities with a both/and approach .” These comments rang true as I reflected on Hologic’s accom - plishments in fiscal 2021.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"We achieved both tremendous financial results, and we used this success to make a unique difference in the world, in authentic ways that leveraged Hologic’s specific business capabilities and culture.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"The graphic on the facing page illustrates this very well, and I’d like to discuss each of the interconnected pieces.",HOLX_2021.pdf

Our purpose is to enable healthier lives everywhere and every day.,HOLX_2021.pdf

"Our purpose, passion and promise galvanize and guide our employees, and serve as a rock-solid foundation for our business strategies.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Grow Revenues and Profits For example, when COVID-19 emerged as the greatest health- care challenge of our lifetimes, we knew that we were in a unique position to make a difference.",HOLX_2021.pdf
We immediately began developing two highly accurate molecular COVID assays for laboratories to run on our global fleet of automated Panther instruments.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"At the same time, we began making plans to dramatically increase manufacturing capacity for both assays and systems.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"As a result, through the end of December, we have provided more than 150 million COVID tests to our customers in more than 50 coun - tries around the world, truly enabling healthier lives everywhere and every day.In fiscal 2021, demand for COVID tests remained high, even as our base women’s health businesses recovered from pandemic- related pressures.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"As a result, revenue and profits grew dramati - cally.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"We generated more than $5.6 billion of revenue for the year, up nearly 50% versus the prior year in constant currency.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"This led to non-GAAP EPS of $8.41, more than double our earnings in 2020.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"What’s more, the cash flow generated from sales of our COVID assays enabled us to buy six companies to accelerate the growth of our diagnostics, breast health and surgical businesses.",HOLX_2021.pdf

"As leaders in diagnostics, we understand the importance of data and know that what we can measure, we can improve.",HOLX_2021.pdf
We also know that women’s health has been overlooked for centuries around the world.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"That’s why we created the Index, the first to statistically represent the health of 2.5 billion women and girls globally.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Developed in partnership with Gallup, the Index is an unprecedented, in-depth examination of critical markers for women’s health by country and territory, and over time.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Based on responses from the 120,000 people surveyed, women’s health needs are not being met globally.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Notably, 40% of those surveyed – equating to about a billion women and girls – had not talked to a healthcare professional in the last year.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"In addition, 60% – equating to about 1.5 billion women and girls – had not been tested in the last year for four common diseases that affect women’s health: cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and sexually transmitted infections.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"This data clearly shows that providing good preventive care is a significant challenge around the world, and illustrates how much more we need to do to drive early disease detection in women.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"While we have made a tremendous impact on women’s health through our innovative and life-saving products, our Index may ultimately prove to be our most significant accomplishment for women’s health.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Second, we formally launched Project Health Equality (see page 20), a $20 million-plus initiative that accelerates and expands our efforts to increase screening and care across a spectrum of life-threatening conditions – breast cancer, cervical cancer and abnormal uterine bleeding – that disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic women.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"For example, compared to white women, Black women in the United States are 40% more likely to die from breast cancer, and Hispanic women are 22% more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Project Health Equality is employing a holistic, three-pronged approach to address the structural and cultural barriers that continue to exacerbate inequality in women’s healthcare: • Supporting actionable research into cultural, social and economic disparities.",HOLX_2021.pdf

"They are a great example of a point the Business Roundtable made in their 2019 statement, that “the free-market system is the best means of gen - erating good jobs, a strong and sustainable economy, innovation, a healthy environment and economic opportunity for all.” More specifically, they can help increase access to state-of-the-art care, promote a more appropriate public policy environment, and ultimately lead to better, more timely diagnoses for women.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"For example, as we share data from our Hologic Global Women’s Health Index with international leaders, elected officials and health organizations, we are providing an actionable, science-backed, data roadmap for improving life expectancy and quality of life for women around the world.",HOLX_2021.pdf

"As a result, we recently scored in the 87th percentile of the index, placing us in the top 20% of the 600 largest companies in S&P’s North American universe.",HOLX_2021.pdf

We track the annual spend with our most critical suppliers.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"Annually, or as needed, our supply chain teams review our current supplier segmentation to determine if any changes are warranted.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Supplier classifications are defined as follows: – Strategic Suppliers: Have the ability to meet and/or exceed the requirements of preferred suppliers, plus are willing to make investments at risk to provide access to cutting-edge technology or services that provide Hologic a marketplace advantage.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"– Preferred Suppliers: Have the ability to meet and/or exceed our quality, delivery and service requirements.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"In addition, these suppliers provide best-in-class pricing, prototyping, technical support and innovation.",HOLX_2021.pdf
Preferred suppliers shall be allowed to work with R&D and sustain engineering on new projects and changes.,HOLX_2021.pdf
– Core Suppliers: Suppliers deemed acceptable for business that do not meet the preferred or strategic classification.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"They meet an acceptable level of quality, delivery, service and cost.",HOLX_2021.pdf
New suppliers start at this level.,HOLX_2021.pdf
– Restricted Suppliers: Are not meeting the business needs of Hologic or are a potential new supplier to be used in a limited capacity.,HOLX_2021.pdf
Restricted suppliers require authorization from management before any new business is awarded or their products are incorporated into new or revised product designs.,HOLX_2021.pdf
– Unapproved Suppliers: Continue not to meet Hologic’s quality and business expectations.,HOLX_2021.pdf
These suppliers have been removed from our approved supplier list and should not be used.,HOLX_2021.pdf
Supplier Performance Monitoring Supplier performance is monitored per Hologic’s performance monitoring process.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"This includes product quality and service metrics, as well as on-time delivery.",HOLX_2021.pdf
Our process enables us to monitor and assess our suppliers’ ability to consistently meet requirements and is tracked via supplier performance monitoring scorecards.,HOLX_2021.pdf
Supplier Risk Management We have a formal process to identify potential risks in the supply chain.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"We perform supplier continuity risk assessments, conduct supplier monitoring as described above, and manage risks based on our supplier segmentation guidelines.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Our supplier risk assessments are per - formed from three vantage points: quality risk, supply continuity risk, and information services data risk.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"The approaches and scope vary for each type of assessment, and the breadth of evaluation will always vary, as the risks differ and are inherent to the nature of business relationships with each supplier.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"We maintain tracking metrics on the percentage of the supply chain covered by risk assessments.Introduction The Company recognizes that proper governance, oversight and compliance with regulations related to procurement is critical to the sustainability of our businesses and to meeting customer expectations.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"Hologic’s Procurement and Supplier Quality Guidebook is shared with our suppliers, with the stated purpose of clearly communicating Hologic’s quality requirements and commercial expecta - tions for suppliers of raw material, components, sub-assemblies, original equipment manufacturers, contract manufacturers and service providers.",HOLX_2021.pdf

"– Supplier Discrimination Policy: Hologic suppliers hire, train, compensate, discipline and terminate workers solely on the ba - sis of their ability to do the job assigned, not based on their race, color, gender, ethnic or national origin; sexual orientation; religion; age; maternity or marital status; or any other trait not pertinent to their professional performance.",HOLX_2021.pdf
– Supplier Gift Policy: Hologic suppliers and employees do not accept gifts from entities that deal with Hologic that could imply a conflict of interest or that have more than modest value.,HOLX_2021.pdf

"We consider our suppliers an extension of our manufacturing processes and a critical part of our success, and therefore, we provide necessary support, whenever possible, to address any disruption of supply.",HOLX_2021.pdf
• Business Continuity and Risk Management.,HOLX_2021.pdf
"To prevent potential disruptions of supply, which can have a direct impact on our customers and their patients, we ensure that our suppliers (and their suppliers) have well-defined, documented plans to identify and mitigate supply chain risks.",HOLX_2021.pdf
"These plans identify risks and mitigation plans related to single, sole sources of supply, impacts to the supplier’s physical plant or infrastructure, and/or the availability of raw material.",HOLX_2021.pdf
The plans should be reviewed and updated regularly and made available to Hologic for review.Supply Chain ManagementCEO Letter Purpose-Driven Company A Champion for Women Unique Culture Global Citizenship Strong Governance 63 2021 U.S.,HOLX_2021.pdf

We hope it helps you understand how Hologic makes a unique difference in the world.,HOLX_2019.pdf
"We believe we have a lot to be proud of, but at the same time, a lot that we can do better.",HOLX_2019.pdf
In this letter I’d like to cover three main topics.,HOLX_2019.pdf
"First, how we got here—the journey we’ve been on to identify and center around our Purpose, Passion and Promise.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Second, why we integrate sustain - ability issues into our day-to-day business strategy and operations, rather than viewing them as separate priorities.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"And third, how our approach to sustainability is coming to life.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Sustainability Through Our Purpose, Passion and Promise First, a little history.",HOLX_2019.pdf
This report is an important milestone—but in no way the end—of a process that began at Hologic a few years ago.,HOLX_2019.pdf
"As we were evolving through organic growth, international expansion, and acquisitions and divestitures, our leadership team set out to clearly define our role in society.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Around the same time, some of our large institutional investors were increasingly analyzing environmental, social and governance factors—sometimes known as ESG—as part of their investment processes.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"For example, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment management company, wrote in early 2018 that: Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society … Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"In response, and after a lot of internal discussion with our Board and employees at all levels, I wrote to stockholders in our 2019 proxy letter that: We have a fundamental obligation to create value for shareholders through profitable, long-term growth.",HOLX_2019.pdf
But this cannot be the whole story.,HOLX_2019.pdf
"To focus solely on financial outcomes would be to ignore the multifaceted, instrumental role that corporations play in our world.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Indeed, most of our employees are motivated by a sense of higher purpose.In that same letter, I quoted Russell Pearlman of the Korn Ferry Institute, who said that “purpose and profit not only peacefully co- exist, but purpose can drive profit.” This describes our approach at Hologic well, since the very work we do—fighting disease through early detection—contributes to a healthier, more sustainable world.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"While companies in most industries provide important benefits to society, we believe ours is a higher calling.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Thus, at Hologic we’ve defined our Purpose as enabling healthier lives, everywhere, every day .",HOLX_2019.pdf
"We know that the more lives we touch, the more our profits will grow over the long term.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"In the last year, for example, we estimate that our products touched more than 234 million people around the world, and we know that today’s profits will fuel even greater investments in human health in the future.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Simply put, we believe strongly that for-profit enterprises like Hologic are having a massive impact on improving human health globally.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Within our Purpose, we place special emphasis on the healthcare needs of women.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Our Passion, therefore, is to become global champions for women’s health .",HOLX_2019.pdf
"We believe that early detection of disease leads to better, more cost-effective health outcomes.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"In fact, no company in the world has done more to fight cervical and breast cancer than we have through our innovative diagnostic solutions.",HOLX_2019.pdf
While women’s health is not our sole focus—we have introduced many products that also benefit men—it is our rallying cry.,HOLX_2019.pdf
We believe our unique passion is urgently needed today.,HOLX_2019.pdf
"For far too long, women’s healthcare needs have been minimized by governments and healthcare systems in emerging—and devel - oped—countries around the world.",HOLX_2019.pdf
So we are inspired by the deep belief that our success as a company will fundamentally improve the health of millions of women and families globally.,HOLX_2019.pdf

THE SCIENCE OF SURE.,HOLX_2019.pdf
"As a healthcare company, we believe we have a special responsibility to patients and medical professionals, since our products contribute to life or death decisions.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"We make a Promise to our customers and patients, a Promise rooted in a concept called The Science of Sure™ .",HOLX_2019.pdf
The Science of Sure is about progressive certainty.,HOLX_2019.pdf
It’s a commitment to help healthcare professionals minimize doubt and maximize the confidence they have in their decisions and diagnoses.,HOLX_2019.pdf
How do we do this?,HOLX_2019.pdf
"To bring The Science of Sure to life and provide value to patients, we focus on: • Product quality .",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Our customers—radiologists, lab technicians, OB/GYNs and many other important healthcare professionals— count on our products to perform as we say they will, when lives and livelihood are at stake.",HOLX_2019.pdf
We must never compromise this trust.,HOLX_2019.pdf
• Clinical differentiation .,HOLX_2019.pdf
Our R&D programs are geared to generate products that provide a meaningful benefit for customers and patients.,HOLX_2019.pdf
• Customers relationships .,HOLX_2019.pdf
We partner with our customers over the long-term to help build their businesses and ensure that pa - tients have access to our products.,HOLX_2019.pdf
"We sell with integrity, help generate patient demand, fight for appropriate reimbursement, and advocate for preventive healthcare.",HOLX_2019.pdf
• Our people .,HOLX_2019.pdf
"We believe that focusing on two simple factors—talent and engagement—helps our employees serve customers more effectively, as well as drive profitable growth.",HOLX_2019.pdf
Sustainability as Part of Our Business Strategy I hope it’s clear that our commitment to sustainable business prac- tices is part and parcel of our mission.,HOLX_2019.pdf
"Said another way, for Hologic to drive consistent, long-term shareholder returns, we must exceed the expectations of our customers—doctors and other healthcare providers who have dedicated their careers to improving human life.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Likewise, we must nurture and engage our employees, who are striving to provide better lives for themselves and their families.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"And finally, we must respect our suppliers and our communities, without whose support our results would eventually collapse.",HOLX_2019.pdf
We believe the interests of our key stakeholders are inextricably linked.,HOLX_2019.pdf
"To deliver profitable growth over the long term, we must, by definition, also meet the needs of customers, employees and our communities.",HOLX_2019.pdf
We don’t spend a lot of time debating whether one group should rank above the others.,HOLX_2019.pdf
"Instead, we believe that our many constituencies are mutually supportive of one another, and that in a vibrant capitalist economy, their successes go hand-in-hand.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Similarly, we believe that sustainability issues should be integrated with our business strategy, led by our Global Leadership Team and overseen by our Board of Directors, rather than managed as a separate set of issues.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Some Early Successes We have begun to demonstrate some early successes based on this approach, with the understanding that we have much oppor - tunity for future improvement.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"For example, in the area of diversity, three of our eight directors (including our lead independent director) are women, which clearly supports the organizational passion I described earlier.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"And three of our directors were born outside the United States, supporting our broad definition of diversity and business goal to grow internationally.Among our senior management team, we have promoted and hired women into key roles, including Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Senior Vice President of Human Resources, Chief Information Officer, and Chief of Staff.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"This represents significant progress since I joined the Company in late 2013, when every member of the senior management team I inherited was a white man.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"To date, we have hired many of our senior women leaders from outside the Company, but we are also developing a solid talent pipeline at all levels of our organization, and expanding this internal pipeline is a key focus going forward.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"For example, we believe that our commercial teams are an important feeder pool for senior management.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"With this in mind, three of our five domestic commercial leaders are women, and one other is a person of color.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"And in our Finance organization, which has not been a stronghold for women traditionally, almost half the members of our leadership team are women, including our CFO and Vice Presidents of Treasury and Tax.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"In hiring new employees, we don’t set diversity targets or quotas.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"Instead, we strive to hire the most talented person for the job, and believe that over time, this will lead to an increasingly diverse workforce.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"In fact, we make wide use of customized assessment tools to eliminate bias in the hiring process.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"These tools are blind to gender and race, which enables us to focus on the potential for performance.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"And it’s performance that drives compensation, which our analysis has shown is equitable between men and women.",HOLX_2019.pdf
"We believe the key to achieving better financial performance is engaged leaders, and that every employee deserves a talented and engaged manager.",HOLX_2019.pdf
So we have been conducting an annual engagement survey since 2015.,HOLX_2019.pdf
