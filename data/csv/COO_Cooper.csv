Assessing Scope 3 emissions across our value chain is a complex process and we expect this process to take time.,Cooper-2020-ESG-Report-FINAL-3.pdf
Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions Explained Cooper’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions footprint increased from calendar year 2019 to calendar year 2020 despite decreased energy demand across the company primarily due to lower levels of operational activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Cooper-2020-ESG-Report-FINAL-3.pdf
The 2020 increase in Cooper’s GHG emissions was largely due to external factors affecting CVI Puerto Rico.,Cooper-2020-ESG-Report-FINAL-3.pdf
"In January 2020, Puerto Rico experienced a 6.4 magnitude earthquake that left two-thirds of residents without power.",Cooper-2020-ESG-Report-FINAL-3.pdf
It also damaged two of the island’s natural gas-fired power plants and since that time has left the island relying on electricity generated from significantly higher emission sources.,Cooper-2020-ESG-Report-FINAL-3.pdf
"CVI Puerto Rico was quick to respond in early 2020, taking action to support affected employees and the local community, and safely restore operations.",Cooper-2020-ESG-Report-FINAL-3.pdf

23 We initiated our GHG measurement project with Scope 2 due to preliminary research that showed our Scope 2 emissions would be higher than Scope 1 emissions.,Cooper-2020-ESG-Report-FINAL-3.pdf
