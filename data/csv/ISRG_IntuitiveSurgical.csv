The events of 2020 inspired Intuitive employee volunteers to further support the foundation’s work on several key initiatives.,ISRG_2020.pdf
The foundation’s multifaceted response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a major focus in 2020.,ISRG_2020.pdf
"Early on, foundation efforts included making donations to provide PPE in China, where COVID-19 first emerged.",ISRG_2020.pdf
"As the pandemic started to impact Santa Clara County and other parts of the U.S., our company and the foundation began working with the Silicon Valley Leadership Group (SVLG) to identify ways to collaborate with local companies and mount a coordinated response.",ISRG_2020.pdf
Hundreds of global Intuitive employee volunteers supported this effort by contributing to various foundation-driven efforts that included producing PPE such as face shields and cloth face masks; exploring ideas for improving manufacturing processes for ventilators and the sterilization of N95 respirators; and developing new protective tools to help those on the front lines of the pandemic.,ISRG_2020.pdf
More than 1.1 million face shields We collaborated with the foundation and with the SVLG’s COVID-19 Aid Coalition’s local consortium of 11 hospitals in developing emergency-use product specifications for the types of PPE most needed in Santa Clara County.,ISRG_2020.pdf
These specifications enabled purchasing experts in Silicon Valley companies to properly source medical supplies they could donate to hospitals and use to protect company employees.,ISRG_2020.pdf
"We didn’t stop at specifications, as we recognized that our company and the Intuitive Foundation could work together to create and assemble face shields for donation.",ISRG_2020.pdf
The Intuitive Foundation funded the materials for our employees to create face shields on socially distanced temporary manufacturing lines in our Sunnyvale and Connecticut offices.,ISRG_2020.pdf
