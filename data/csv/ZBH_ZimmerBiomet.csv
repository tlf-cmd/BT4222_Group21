Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) 12 Management of Risks Associated with Use of Critical Materials Zimmer Biomet has a Global Supply Risk Management process.,sustainability-report-2020.pdf
"We have established a systematic approach to: • Ensure continuity of supply for goods and services • Proactively manage (identify, assess, mitigate and monitor) potential supply risks which may result in product delays and/or revenue impact to the business • Ensure that a global process is being utilized across the Zimmer Biomet Global Sourcing Organization A key component in risk monitoring is the financial impacts that might occur in raw material scarcity and/or physical disruptions of Zimmer Biomet’s own operations or in the operations of our supply chain.",sustainability-report-2020.pdf
"To mitigate these risks, Zimmer Biomet utilizes a third party to rank our top suppliers against 73 financial ratios on a scale of 1-100 to understand the overall financial health of these suppliers.",sustainability-report-2020.pdf
It is considered to have substantive strategic impact on Zimmer Biomet’s business if suppliers score below a 20 in this rating.,sustainability-report-2020.pdf
"Through a third-party vendor, the Company obtains international private company financial statements and has a greater than 85 percent success rate (and above 90 percent in certain markets) to measure the core health of a supplier out to 36 months, and predicating probability of default over 12 to 18 months via a quantitative model to generate a rating.Animal Testing Policy Zimmer Biomet’s utilization of animal testing is consistent with animal welfare acts around the world.",sustainability-report-2020.pdf
We utilize animal testing when required to demonstrate biological safety for our products that cannot be demonstrated by laboratory benchtop tests or when required to demonstrate compliance with medical device regulations.,sustainability-report-2020.pdf
