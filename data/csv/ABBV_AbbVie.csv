This big data falls into three broad buckets: 1.,,,
"Clinical data, which helps evaluate a medicine’s safety and effectiveness 2.",,,
"Economic and resource utilization (including inpatient admissions, emergency room visits, outpatient visits and other medical services) data, which is used to evaluate its economic value 3.",,,
"Patient experience data, which typically focuses on signs, symptoms and impacts that are important to patients Large and diverse data allows us to better understand the experience of patients often excluded from clinical trials, as well as evaluate treatment comparisons that may not have been made in a randomized controlled trial.",,,
"In addition, this data helps us understand healthcare resource utilization and potential cost offsets associated with therapies or interventions used in the real world.",,,
"When real-world data is put into context and complements data from clinical trials, a more comprehensive assessment and understanding of a treatment or disease, healthcare delivery and, ultimately, a person’s experience of treatment is captured, all of which is used to advance patient care and access to treatment.",,,

,,"For example, some of the most important symptoms (itching, pain) and impacts (sleep disturbance) of atopic dermatitis cannot be easily observed by a clinician.",
,,We sought to learn about how treatment impacts these factors directly from patients.,

,,Investing to build new understanding and find genuinely novel solutions is critical to our mission and is one of our core commitments.,
,,"Our vision is to help create transformative change, not just incremental improvement.",
,,"For autoimmune disease, that means aiming for remission, not just symptom management.",
,,"For cancer, it means finding ways for patients to achieve better and longer-lasting treatment results.",
,,"For neuroscience, an area many across the industry have exited, we continue to pursue ways to slow, halt and ultimately reverse the damage of debilitating diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.",
,,We know that the true value of a medicine is in the difference it makes in a patient’s everyday life.,
,,We are investing in new ways to bring a patient focus into the lab and the clinic as we develop innovative treatments.,
,,"This includes ensuring that we address and measure the outcomes that really matter, and provide support beyond our medicine, to help patients achieve the best possible health outcomes.",
,,"We recognize that in order to benefit from our medicines, patients must be able to access and afford them.",
,,Our approach to access is tailored on a product- and country-specific basis.,
,,"We consider a range of factors including local disease burden, health and economic value of the medicine, ability to pay and budget impact and other factors impacting disease-specific outcomes, as well as the sustainability of different access strategies for the system and our business.",
,,"Depending on the situation, we use a variety of approaches, including pricing and reimbursement models, patient financial assistance programs, intellectual property licensing, product donation and support for local capacity-building programs.",

,,,"For example, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains an issue of concern for patients and providers and the pharmaceutical industry ."
,,,"In 2019, our internal safety advisory groups hosted an educational forum for approximately 300 AbbVie R&D employees, led by four world-renowned expert hepatologists ."
,,,"The discussion focused on prediction, prevention and management of DILI and will help our teams collect the right data at the right intervals to better recognize DILI as a safety signal ."
,,,"We are also using learnings and tools from behavioral science to enhance the ways we teach patients to use our medicines, with the goal of reducing medication errors and improving adherence."
,,,"This year, we began to systematically incorporate the use of teach-back, an established health literacy technique, into our interactions with patients using our injectable medicines ."
,,,"Teach-back helps us to better understand how patients interpret the information we give them, which in turn allows us to further adapt our communications to address patient needs ."
,,,"Drawing on insights from data science, patient safety and human behavior, Q was developed through a collaboration between our safety team, our business technology team and students at the AbbVie Innovation Center at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign."
,,,"16 2019 Responsible Action Report Quality To ensure quality and regulatory compliance, AbbVie manufacturing sites received dozens of external inspections and audits."
