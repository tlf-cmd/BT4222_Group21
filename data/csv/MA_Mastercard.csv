There’s always more to do.,,,
Climate change and social inequality are long-term issues we all need to address.,,,

"There will always be challenges, but we must remain dedicated to our efforts.",,,
"We need to motivate ourselves to take them on, knowing we must all make a difference, both for the planet and for our neighbors.",,,
We see the benefit of learning from each other and identifying where science and technology — alongside personal passions — can continue the progress.,,,
There’s nothing we can’t achieve when we work together and have a clear mission.,,,
"This is true for society at large, as much as it is for our company.",,,
Mastercard thrives when economies thrive.,,,

We cannot fix one at the expense of another.,,,
Our world — global and local communities — is successful when growth is sustainable and inclusive and when prosperity is shared.,,,
This is why we continually lean into challenges.,,,
It’s why we set goals like bringing 1 billion people into the financial mainstream and achieving a net-zero-carbon footprint.,,,
"It’s why we support Black entrepreneurs to close racial wealth and opportunity gaps, women leaders to narrow gender disparities, and small business owners all over the world to grow prosperity.",,,

That’s where the value of collaboration and partnership shines brightest.,,,
That’s why every one of our employees has part of their compensation tied to how the company delivers on our ESG goals.,,,
It’s why we actively participate in groups like the OECD’s Network of Experts on AI to ensure high standards for data use.,,,
"And, it’s been at the heart of our Center for Inclusive Growth for nearly a decade.",,,
"In our 2021 Sustainability Report, we share Mastercard’s commitments to make a positive impact and provide an update on our efforts from the past year.",,,

"It is a large-scale, high-value conservation opportunity that prioritizes benefits for climate and biodiversity by engaging and directly benefiting local people to promote a sustainable economy.",,,
"We have committed to this re storation goal with Conservation International and the World Resources Institute, whose reliance on proven science helps them guide investments to areas where restoration can be conducted in the most ecologically and socially responsible ways, and delivers the best chance of success to drive positive impact.",,,
"This means planting the right trees in the right places to maximize benefits for climate, community and biodiversity, and employing globally consistent monitoring and maintenance protocols.",,,
"Our restoration projects will not utilize invasive species, nor any species destined for timber harvest, and will employ only ecologically and socially appropriate restoration methods, as determined by each individual project and location.",,,
"We calculate not only how many trees have been regrown and, as projects mature, the approximate carbon capture impact they have had, but also how our work benefits the communities who reside in and around these landscapes.",,,
How the forest landscape and biodiversity are thriving over the long term is another standard measurement.,,,
"Ongoing monitoring includes baseline, first-year and long-term protocols for each project, with coordinated global analysis for the entire program, including geospatial and remote sensing, satellite and drone technology, and field-based sampling and ground-truthing methods.",,,
"Our ongoing statistical evaluation ensures efficacy and maximizes accuracy and efficiency, while counterfactual control sites matching the original conditions help determine additionality.",,,

"To assess the transition risks and opportunities for our market and business, we used high-, medium- and low-emission scenarios focused on five key regions — United States, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia-Pacific — across two time horizons, short-term (2025) and medium-term (2040).",,,
These time horizons roughly align with our GHG targets and consider near term and long term.,,,
"To assess the physical impacts of climate change on certain facilities, including our global and regional headquarters, key data centers and key supplier locations, we evaluated potential threats to business-critical sites under future climate projections based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).",,,
Risks were analyzed across several time horizons including a future midterm projection (2035) and a future long-term projection (2060).,,,
"This qualitative analysis of 12 sites is part of our broader process to evaluate threats and risk mitigation opportunities across our global operations, supply chain and revenue sources.",,,
Each of the 12 sites was examined by looking at seven potential risks resulting from the physical impacts of climate change.,,,
"The RCP 8.5 scenario was selected because it represents a business-as-usual, worst-case scenario climate emissions trajectory model and provides an upper-boundary condition to support our analysis and risk-management measures.",,,
"This preliminary analysis indicates that we could see increasing risk of chronic climate stressors (increasing temperatures, sea level rise) and acute climate events (flooding, drought, extreme temperatures) at a majority of the sites by 2060.",,,
Such potential risks are not forecasts and are not necessarily indicative of future performance.,,,
"They also do not take into account potential risk-mitigation or adaptation efforts, and assume that such sites continue to operate through the dates specified.",,,
"Current opportunities include sustainable and resilient programs and services, such as the Priceless Planet Coalition ; carbon calculator tools such as ours, which is powered by the Doconomy Åland Index; accelerated digitization of transactions; and resilience services, such as support for disaster needs.",,,
Current transition risks include impacts to travel patterns and inequitable global growth.,,,

,"This analysis included multiple International Energy Agency (IEA) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios and time horizons to evaluate future states, noting that at this point it is not clear which one is the most likely.",,
,"To assess the transition risks and opportunities for our market and business, we used high-, medium- and low-emission scenarios focused on five key regions — the United States, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific — across two time horizons, short-term (2025) and medium-term (2040).",,
,These time horizons roughly align with our GHG targets and consider near-term and long-term.,,
,"To assess the physical impacts of climate change on certain facilities, including our global and regional headquarters, key data centers and key supplier locations, we evaluated potential threats to business-critical sites under future climate projections based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP).",,
,Risks were analyzed across several time horizons including a future mid-term projection (2035) and a future long-term projection (2060).,,
,"This qualitative analysis of 12 sites is part of our broader process to evaluate threats and risk mitigation opportunities across our global operations, supply chain and revenue sources.",,
,Each of the 12 sites was examined by looking at seven potential risks resulting from the physical impacts of climate change.,,
,"The RCP8.5 scenario was selected because it represents a business - as-usual, worse-case scenario climate emissions trajectory model and provides an upper-boundary condition to support our analysis and risk-management measures.",,
,"This preliminary analysis indicates that we could see increasing risk of chronic climate stressors (increasing temperatures, sea level rise) and acute climate events (flooding, drought, extreme temperatures) at a majority of the sites by 2060.",,
,Such potential risks are not forecasts and are not necessarily indicative of future performance.,,
,They also do not take into account potential risk-mitigation or adaptation efforts and assume that such sites continue to operate through the dates specified.,,

,,,Doing well by doing good Corporate Sustainability Report 2019The world we’re standing in today looks very different than it did a year ago.
,,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives and livelihoods and shown us very clearly how deeply interconnected our world has become — in ways that go far beyond our politics, our cultures and our supply chains."
,,,"And the race tensions in the United States, echoed by protests against all kinds of racial injustices around the world, underscore just how much more work we have to do."
,,,"These converging crises lay bare three challenges we are confronted with: the tensions between humanity and nature (i.e., the environment), the distinction between one and many (i.e., inclusion), and the balance between the short-term and the long-term (i.e., how we manage our businesses, communities and more for success and social impact)."
,,,"How we resolve these challenges will determine how we make Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) central to our business model."
,,,"We seek to integrate environmental considerations not just into our practices, but to offer consumers the opportunity to do so, too."
,,,We seek to pursue commercially sustainable social impact that can deliver short-term gains while also building longer-term systems that help set everyone up for success.
,,,"And all of that means we have to organize ourselves around sound and ethical business practices that are guided by clear and sustainable purposes.Earlier this year, Mastercard introduced a new purpose statement: Connecting Everyone to Priceless Possibilities."
,,,It’s a statement that speaks to how we run our company.
,,,"We set our workforce up for success first — through culture, inclusion, development and opportunity — so that they can set our business up for success in the long run."
,,,"It is our people’s decency, their diversity and their commitment to doing well by doing good that make it possible for us to keep delivering on our commitments to enable commerce, to drive financial inclusion, to give back to the environment and to maintain a strong business model over the long term."
,,,Putting our hand at their backs gives us all a boost.
,,,"While the words of our purpose statement are new, the spirit is not."
,,,"Our people use our technology, resources and capabilities to drive financial inclusion — because bringing more people into the digital economy strengthens the system, empowers its users and leads to inclusive growth."
,,,That’s why we’re doubling down on our original financial inclusion commitment to bring a total of 1 billion people into the financial system by 2025.
,,,We are committed to bringing 50 million micro and small businesses into the digital economy and to helping 25 million women-owned and -run businesses with the tools they need to succeed and grow — part of our ongoing efforts to help small businesses get through this crisis and continue to drive job creation and inclusive growth.The statement also speaks to how we look at our responsibility to the environment.
,,,The quality and nature of our own future are deeply and inextricably linked to the health and well-being of our planet.
,,,"If we want to keep growing and thriving as individuals, corporations or countries, we have to do better."
,,,That’s why we’re accelerating our plan to improve our environmental footprint and putting the power of our network of partners — consumers included — behind a “Priceless Planet Coalition”.
,,,"The coalition is designed to take collective action against climate change, including educating, incentivizing and inspiring consumers to participate in carbon footprint-reducing behaviors and contribute to tree-planting efforts."
,,,"We are all in this crisis together, but we have a choice as to how we come out of it: We can put things back the way they were before, or we can work together to rebuild a better, stronger, more resilient and more inclusive digital economy, one that benefits everyone, everywhere."

,,,"However, inequality and exclusion can hold women back, in part because much of our world was designed without women involved or in mind."
,,,"Mastercard is tackling this imbalance head-on, joining forces with our customers and organizations such as the Financial Alliance for Women to design better products, communications and experiences for women."
,,,"As part of this focused effort, we have invested in global consumer research to better understand women’s financial needs, attitudes and behaviors across 18 markets."
,,,"We also developed Women by Design, our proprietary framework for designing more inclusive financial solutions."
,,,"Collaborating with our Labs as a Service team, we launched Women Sparks, a design thinking innovation workshop focused on working with our partners on women-centric concept development."

,,,Last year’s inaugural class of Data Fellows delivered groundbreaking research demonstrating the power of data philanthropy to address social issues around inclusive growth.
,,,"Mastercard put our insights to work in New Orleans, looking to see whether data could be used to determine the economic health of a community."
,,,The city needed hard data about the strengths of historically black neighborhoods to attract new investment and development.
,,,"More than 60 Mastercard data scientists gathered in 2019 for a 36-hour “Datathon,” joining forces with Michelle Thompson, a University of New Orleans professor and Mastercard data fellow who has been working with community leaders to develop insights to bolster investment."
,,,Mastercard data scientists identified trends in consumer spending and store openings that uncovered and validated enormous growth in two overlapping areas of New Orleans — the Claiborne Corridor Cultural Innovation District (CID) and the Livable Claiborne Corridor (LCC).
,,,"The analysis is helping the community validate that neighborhood development efforts appear to be paying off — consumer spending and store openings in the area have risen sharply since those efforts began in 2015, according to the results from the Datathon analysis."
,,,"Between 2015 and 2018, consumer spending growth at CID retail businesses was 12 times greater when compared with Greater New Orleans."
,,,"In the larger LCC, consumer spending grew by 16%."

,,,"These donations benefitted highly regarded international organizations, as well as national nonprofits, in support of local projects ."
,,,The model is simple: Consumer transactions over the Mastercard network in a defined time frame produce a small charitable donation.

,,,It allows cardholders to direct small donations to specific charities every time they use their cards.
,,,They also can register for monthly donations or one- off donations in support of the causes they care about most.

,,,"Our support, along with that of millions of cardholders, helped SU2C fund breakthrough clinical trials and new treatments that can save lives now."
,,,"SU2C-supported research also led to five new Food and Drug Administration-approved cancer therapies, including treatments for breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers and certain difficult-to- treat leukemias."
,,,"Stand Up to Cancer works relentlessly to bring the latest, most effective and most promising cancer treatments to patients as quickly as possible by bringing together the best minds to collaborate, innovate and share their clinical research."
,,,"In the spirit of this collaboration, we developed marketing programs that harness the collective power of our cardholders."
,,,"From July 1 through Aug. 15, 2019, Mastercard committed up to $4 million by donating 1 cent to SU2C every time a U.S. cardholder charged $10 or more on their card while dining out."
,,,"We doubled the donation when consumers paid for their meals with a contactless transaction.Providing nutritious meals for children Since our partnership with the World Food Programme (WFP) began, Mastercard, its partners and cardholders have donated a total of $26.9 million1 to fund the equivalent value of more than 107 million meals.2 For many children born into difficult circumstances, a school meal is often the only nutritious meal they receive each day and it can mean the difference between going to school or helping their parents at home or in the field."
,,,The benefits of school meals go beyond education and health — they are key to unlocking children’s potential and helping communities build self-sufficiency.
,,,"Here are just a few examples of the on-the-ground impact the WFP made around the world, with our help, in 2019:In Mali, Mastercard helped the WFP reopen closed school canteens and expand to 25 new locations in 2019, enabling school meals for 66,000 children."

,,,"For new leases, we prioritize locations with green certifications."
,,,"In 2019, we set energy intensity unit requirements (EIU, which measures kWh consumption per square foot) for every new project, empowering our planners, builders and contractors to work together for creative efficiency solutions adapted to every locale."
,,,We’ve also begun to implement those same standards at existing properties.
,,,"Additionally, we installed sub- metering technology in many of our offices to identify energy-saving opportunities to help reach our science- based emissions goals."

,,,"To support this movement in alignment with growing consumer sentiment, Mastercard established the Greener Payments Partnership (GPP) with key industry partners Giesecke & Devrient, IDEMIA and Thales."
,,,"Early in 2020, we welcomed our newest member, CPI Card Group."
,,,The GPP is a cross-industry initiative of card manufacturers seeking to further the goal of reducing the use of new polyvinyl chloride (commonly known as PVC) in all plastic payment cards.
,,,"With payment-card shipments accounting for 33,000 tons of plastic annually, according to the Nilson Report, the impact might be limited, but we’re committed to doing our part in an area where we have major influence."
,,,"Greener Payments Partnership To that end, the GPP published a shortlist of over 25 products and suppliers that provide an alternative to first-use PVC traditionally used in payment cards."
,,,"The effort is the first milestone of a long-term effort to identify alternative, sustainable materials — ethically, bio- and ocean- sourced, and chlorine-free — in everyday products."
,,,"The list offers financial institutions a resource to learn more about those alternatives, connect them to card manufacturers and ultimately augment their own sustainability initiatives with a systemic change to their supply chains."
,,,"To further our efforts and capabilities in plastics analysis and research, Mastercard has invested in the innovative Bruker Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, a Zeiss Scanning electron microscope and a Zeiss SmartProof confocal microscope."
,,,FTIR spectroscopy enables independent analysis of a card’s material makeup so we can assess and validate our vendors’ environmental claims.
,,,"By examining cards at a molecular level, we can identify the plastics and adhesives in each layer."
,,,"Our scanning electron microscopes scale down further, to the nanometer range, to identify card constructs and potential contaminants."
,,,Mastercard can leverage these insights with vendors and issuers for quality control and sustainable benefit.
,,,We can also apply this data to new product development and design.

,,,"Worldwide, contactless transactions grew twice as fast as non-contactless transactions in the grocery and drug store categories between February and March 2020.SAFETY AND SECURITY SOLUTIONS Protecting the digital payment transaction 89 Ethical and Responsible StandardsTokenization We created Mastercard Digital Enablement Services (MDES), our tokenization platform, in 2013 to bring the same strong cryptographic protection to digital transactions that EMV chip devices provide in-store."
,,,"In 2019, we processed 3.96 billion transactions through MDES, which is three times more than in 2018."
,,,"This increase was achieved by expanding our tokenization services to a total of more than 2,500 issuers in 65 markets."
,,,"Mastercard has also continued to scale MDES for Merchants, which uses the same technologies to unburden merchants of sensitive account data storage, make online transactions more user-friendly and reduce payment declines."
,,,This advance has made online payments more convenient and reduced declined transactions.
,,,"Since its launch in 2018, MDES for Merchants has accounted for 93 million payment authorizations at the end of 2019.Click to Pay Mastercard launched Click to Pay — a faster, more secure online checkout based on the EMV® Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) industry standard — to our U.S. customers."
,,,"This technology simplified card payment processing across desktop and mobile sites, mobile apps and connected devices."
,,,"Like a single in-store point-of-sale, Click to Pay provides a consistent digital checkout experience."
,,,"When paired with our token and authorization standards, it delivers the simple, convenient and transparent checkout experience consumers demand and deserve.Digital Identity Our strategy also protects digital identities, helping banks and merchants identify genuine consumers to stop fraud."
,,,Digital interactions have evolved rapidly with the current pace of technological change.
,,,"This has inevitably challenged the notions of identity, trust and privacy with which we traditionally anchor ourselves in the physical world."
,,,"In March 2019, we announced our model for digital identity that is global in scope, sensitive to local needs, and interoperable between institutions and sectors, and ensures that people are the guardians of their identity data."
,,,"At the heart of the model are our 10 Principles of Digital Identity , which focus on data rights, ownership, confidentiality, consent, transparency, simplicity, fair use, choice, security and inclusion."
,,,"They amount to fundamental individual rights: “I own my identity and I control my identity data.” Our model securely binds a person’s identity to their smartphone or other device, drawing on biometrics that recognize the user’s face, thumbprint or voice."
,,,"Digital identity has the potential to unlock new and improved experiences for people as they interact online with businesses, service providers, governments and their communities."
,,,It also will reduce the risk of fraud and identity theft.
,,,"We have built an exceptional roster of partners, including Microsoft and Samsung, and have begun to preview real-world tests of our digital identity solution in Australia, North Macedonia and other locations.AT THE HEART OF THE MODEL ARE OUR 10 PRINCIPLES OF DIGITAL IDENTITY, WHICH FOCUS ON DATA RIGHTS, OWNERSHIP, CONFIDENTIALITY, CONSENT, TRANSPARENCY, SIMPLICITY, FAIR USE, CHOICE, SECURITY AND INCLUSION."
,,,"90 Ethical and Responsible StandardsThe explosion in the number of digital players, applications and devices creates connections and vulnerabilities."
,,,"Fraudsters are exploiting the weak links in new internet of Things devices, applications and providers that neglect to use stringent network, regulatory and security standards and protocols."
,,,"As a result, all stakeholders are at risk of attack — even those with strong individual fraud protections."
,,,Mastercard continually invests in cyber and network protection to address evolving widespread threats to the ecosystem.
,,,Connected Intelligence We developed Connected Intelligence as a comprehensive approach to end- to-end online payment security.
,,,"By linking insights across the customer journey, we can cut fraud and provide a more frictionless experience."
,,,"Connected Intelligence unites a range of capabilities such as bot detection, biometrics, device intelligence and behavioral analytics."
,,,"Each of these tools individually is necessary for any payment security strategy, but by linking the insights across each layer and applying machine learning and AI, we enable a smarter fraud prevention strategy."
,,,"This provides both improved security and a superior experience from the beginning of the consumer journey through to authorization and dispute resolution at the other end.NuDetect behavioral biometrics NuDetect uses biometrics and analytics to distinguish authentic users from potential fraudsters, based on their online, mobile app and smartphone interactions."
,,,These device-level insights enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to improve their authorization decisions by mitigating fraud before a purchase is processed.
,,,"In 2019, we monitored over 650 billion events worldwide, 34% of which we identified as high-risk and flagged for action to the merchants and financial institutions involved."
,,,"In addition, we analyzed global login data to reveal that 52% of all login attempts across all industries are at high risk of fraud."
,,,"Ethoca In April 2019 we acquired Ethoca, an award-winning provider of collaboration-based intelligence and technology solutions that help businesses around the world fight fraud, prevent disputes and improve the customer experience."
,,,"Our solutions provide rich intelligence throughout the customer purchase journey and bring together real-time fraud, customer dispute and purchase insights to close costly communication gaps between all stakeholders in the payment ecosystem.Decision Intelligence A key challenge in combating digital payments fraud is rapidly and accurately distinguishing genuine transactions from fraud attempts with minimal friction for the consumer."
,,,Our Decision Intelligence platform analyzes our network through artificial intelligence to make authorization recommendations in real time.
,,,The platform’s sophisticated modeling distills thousands of data points into a single decision score that helps issuers fine-tune their authorization decisions to approve more legitimate transactions without increasing risk.
,,,"For each transaction: • We look at transaction fraud models and profiles against current, widespread fraud monitoring activity."
,,,• We assess these attributes based on consumer account and device information.
,,,• Insights from account spending help define the value and engagement of the consumer/issuer relationship.Safeguarding interactions 91 Ethical and Responsible StandardsSafety Net Cyberattacks have grown increasingly sophisticated.
,,,"In response to the growing threat, Mastercard’s Safety Net monitors transactions continuously at the global network level, using artificial intelligence to screen hundreds of millions of transactions daily."
,,,"By instantly isolating systemic threats and blocking fraudulent transactions, Safety Net limits the financial and reputational damage of large-scale fraud."
,,,"From 2018 through 2019, Safety Net blocked over $14 billion in potentially fraudulent authorization attempts from large-scale attacks across all transaction channels."
,,,"For issuers, Safety Net monitors transactions at the network level to identify and mitigate data breaches in issuer or processor systems."
,,,"Safety Net’s external layer of defense, independent from customer systems, uses selective authorization controls to block transactions according to multiple criteria."
,,,"Safety Net gradually escalates its response to detected threats, allowing issuers to better manage their fraud strategies and consumer impact."
,,,"For acquirers, Safety Net’s monitoring criteria and rules can evaluate transactions from an acquirer perspective, analyzing overall activity for a specified acquirer and/or cardholder across multiple ATMs and merchants globally in order to identify large-scale attacks.Threat Scan Threat Scan assesses issuer production authorization networks for vulnerabilities to fraud by emulating known criminal transaction behavior."
,,,It highlights vulnerabilities to criminal attacks and provides network insights that can help issuers realize fewer fraud losses with a proactive approach to fraud prevention.
,,,"Threat Scan offers a pragmatic way for issuers to identify gaps in authorization security by conducting assessments within production versus testing environments for a variety of fraud types, including counterfeit accounts, PIN manipulation, and lost and stolen cards.ID Theft Protection Identity theft can be financially and emotionally devastating for consumers."
,,,ID Theft Protection places consumers in control of their identities — proactively monitoring and resolving identity-theft issues.
,,,"Using a three- step process, ID Theft Protection safeguards consumers’ most valuable asset."
,,,"Detect: Uncovers potential identity and credit fraud at inception by scouring the deepest corners of the internet, searching for potentially damaging use of consumers’ personal and credit report information."
,,,Alert: Provides immediate alerts if suspicious activity related to consumer identity or credit is found — allowing immediate action to be taken to minimize damage.
,,,"Resolve: Combats identity threats quickly with self-service resolution or specialist support, helping to restore consumer identities and prevent further damage."
,,,"92 Ethical and Responsible StandardsRiskRecon In 2019, Mastercard acquired RiskRecon in order to promote the understanding of, and strategies against, third-party cyber risk."
