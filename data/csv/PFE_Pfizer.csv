Pfizer is uniquely positioned in both developed and emerging markets to promote health and wellness and respond more effectively to unmet medical needs.,,,
"Together with our partners, we are looking for meaningful ways to improve health care around the world.",,,
Ensuring steady progress in biomedical science is a part of that.,,,
So is improving our business.,,,
Pfizer has been undergoing a transformation that is making us more entrepreneurial and accountable.,,,
Our plans to acquire Wyeth are designed to accelerate this process.,,,
"We are striving to create the world’s premier biopharmaceutical company: diverse, flexible, and a leader in nearly all dimensions of human and animal medicines and vaccines.www.pfizer.com/responsibility 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2INTRODUCTION www.pfizer.com/responsibilit y 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2 22 RESEARC h & D EvELOP mENT 44 ENvIRON mENT , hEALT h AND SA fETY28 ACCESS TO m EDICINE S 50 gOvERNANCE 36 PATIENT SA fETY 56 mANufACT uRIN g & S uPPLY C hAIN 40 SALES & mAR kETIN g 60 COLLEA guES & CO mmu NIT YTABLE O f CONTENTS 1 COmmITTED TO R ESPONSIBLE gRO wTh 3 ABOuT ThE REPOR T 4 ChAIRmAN’S LETTER TO S TAkEhOLDER S 6 PfIzER C OmPANY P ROfILE PfIzER C ORPORATE R ESPONSIBILIT Y 7 STAkEhOLDER ENgAgEmENT 8 2008/2009 gOAL S 10 PfIzER’S APPROAC h TO Pu BLIC P OLICY E NgAgEmENT The New Era of Responsibility The Pf IzeR COmm ITmeNT fOR TODay & T OmORRO w113 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT www.pfizer.com/responsibilityAbout the Repo Rt We are pleased to provide you with Pfizer’s third report on our corporate responsibility performance.",,,
This report highlights our recent activities and updates our last report.,,,
"Based on feedback from readers and stakeholders, we have chosen to make this report more succinct than previous ones and to focus more exclusively on our progress since our last report.",,,
"More detailed information on our activities, including case studies, policies and guidelines, can be found on our Web site, www.pfizer.com/responsibility.SCOPE O f REPORTIN g This report covers Pfizer’s businesses, and includes activities and data from the calendar years 2007 and 2008.",,,
Additional updates from 2009 are referenced where relevant.,,,
The report does not discuss the proposed acquisition of Wyeth except in forward-looking statements.,,,
"Pfizer produces a Corporate Responsibility Report every other year, and updates the Web site with new information quarterly.",,,
Our last report was published in 2007. mATERIALITY The content of this report is based on a materiality analysis focusing on two key factors—the importance to stakeholders and the potential to influence business strategy.,,,
Materiality was assessed by our Corporate Responsibility team and by an external advisory group.,,,
The analysis identified the top issues we should be focusing on to meet our commercial goals and stakeholder expectations.,,,
"STAkEhOLDER INCL uSIvENESS We greatly value our stakeholders’ perspectives, and all Pfizer units engage with stakeholders on relevant issues throughout the year.",,,
"Additionally, in keeping with the principle of stakeholder inclusiveness, we have interviewed key stakeholders to gain their perspectives on our corporate responsibility performance and on reporting expectations.",,,
"Feedback from these interviews has been used to shape the content of this report, and direct commentary from stakeholders is included in some sections.",,,
"If you wish to comment on the information in this report, we invite you to contact us online at www.pfizer.com/contact.",,,

"For information on GRI, please see www.globalreporting.org.INTRODUCTION 4To Our Stakeholders, Whenever people need medicines to stay healthy or to get well, Pfizer wants to be there.",,,
"We’re in business to discover, develop and deliver new medicines to people across the globe.",,,
It’s our most important contribution to the world.,,,
But we know this alone is not enough.,,,
How we do our work matters just as much as what we do.,,,

"While this ongoing work will never be finished, we do pause from time to time to assess our progress.",,,
"In this spirit, I am pleased to share with you Pfizer’s 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report.",,,
"Since our last report two years ago, unprecedented and historic economic changes have touched people in every part of the world and in every industry, including our own.",,,
The long-term effects of the global economic downturn likely will not be known for some time.,,,
"But right now, it’s clear that millions of people have lost their jobs, their health care or their savings.",,,
"And we know that in times like these, people expect more from us than ever before.",,,
"Pfizer has remained steadfastly focused on transforming our business, so that we will be better able to serve the needs of people everywhere.",,,
"Early in 2009, Pfizer announced plans to acquire Wyeth, the fifth-largest biopharmaceutical company in the United States.",,,
"Together, we will be a diverse and flexible leader in nearly all dimensions of human and animal medicines and vaccines—and a company well positioned to deliver more new heath care solutions to people in both developed and emerging countries in all parts of the world.",,,
"In times like these, some companies might choose to focus simply on running their businesses and think of their corporate responsibility work as a luxury that can wait for better times.",,,
Not Pfizer.,,,
We believe successful companies can’t do one without the other.,,,
"The world’s economic problems have eroded the public’s trust in large businesses, and that’s just one reason why I personally believe that now is the most important time to reaffirm Pfizer’s commitment to responsible and sustainable business practices.",,,
The theme of our report this year is “The New Era of Responsibility” and speaks to Pfizer’s evolving responsibilities in a changing world.,,,
"It is my firm belief that for companies to thrive they must adapt, must innovate.",,,
For Pfizer this means an even sharper focus on the health needs of society and a renewed commitment to fulfilling the role promised by our scale and expertise.,,,
"In this report, you will find tangible results.",,,
You will see us reaching out to the communities where we operate.,,,
"You will see new approaches to improving access to medicines and health care around the world, both through strategic philanthropic programs and new commercial models.",,,
You will also learn more about our efforts to provide greater clarity on our business practices and communicate more transparently with stakeholders.,,,
This report begins to answer some of the questions we’ve asked ourselves.,,,
How can we ensure health care is accessible and affordable to people everywhere —in both the world’s poorest areas and its wealthiest?,,,
"How do we continue to earn the trust that our customers put in Pfizer and our products, while also making sure they understand that all medicines have both benefits and risks?",,,
"In a world that’s just beginning to understand the effects of energy use on climate change, how can we reduce our environmental footprint?",,,
How can we collaborate with people and their governments to help create an environment where innovative new medicines can be brought to market and where patients are able to receive the medicines they need?,,,
"As you read this report, you will see opportunities on www.pfizer.com to learn more about: • Our efforts to improve public health around the world; • Using medicines safely; • Our clinical trial studies of experimental new medicines and the post-marketing studies we conduct after medicines are on the market; • The progress of the medicines we’re studying; • Our political contributions; • The grants we give to medical associations, patient groups and health care professionals; and • Our environmental performance.",,,
All of us at Pfizer are proud of the work described in this report.,,,
It reflects the tireless commitment of tens of thousands of colleagues working in more than 150 countries around the world.,,,
They have dedicated their careers to helping others live longer and healthier lives.,,,
"As Pfizer’s Chairman and CEO, I’m inspired every day by their work.",,,
"Pfizer is continuing to evolve, and we remain committed to meeting your expectations.",,,
"Every day, we come to work eager to embrace innovation, achieve results responsibly and help people everywhere improve their health.",,,
"We look to the future with optimism, and we hope you do too.",,,
"Sincerely, Jeff kindler Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerINTRODUCTION www.pfizer.com/responsibilit y 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 6Pfizer Company Profile Pfizer is the world’s largest research-based biopharmaceutical company.",,,
"Our corporate headquarters is in New York City, and our major research and development locations are in the United States and the U.K.",,,
"In 2008, Pfizer generated $48.3 billion in revenues, earned $8.1 billion in profits after taxes, and invested $7.9 billion in research and development.",,,
"We operate in nearly every market in the world, and 58 percent of our revenues are generated outside the U.S.",,,
OPERATIONAL S TRuCTuRE Pfizer’s Board of Directors is elected annually by shareholders and is overwhelmingly composed of independent Directors.,,,
The Board oversees management and is ultimately responsible for management’s performance.,,,
More information is available in the Governance section of this report.,,,
"Pfizer’s Chairman and CEO is Jeff Kindler, who was elected to these positions in 2006.",,,
He is supported by a nine-member executive leadership team.,,,
"In 2008, we took a dramatic step to reshape Pfizer into a more flexible, entrepreneurial and accountable organization.",,,
"We completely reorganized our global market-leading Pharmaceutical segment into customer-focused business units devoted to Primary Care, Specialty Care, Oncology, Emerging Markets and Established Products.",,,
"This new approach enables us to move forward with the entrepreneurial zeal inherent in small businesses, backed by the scope and strength of a global enterprise.",,,
"3 read mOre a T www.PfIzER.COmPfizer Corporate Responsibility Corporate responsibility is fundamental to Pfizer’s business and to our ability to achieve our mission of “Working together for a healthier world.” To do so, we must be committed to conducting our business in an ethical manner and putting patients’ needs first in everything we do and everywhere we operate.",,,
"Through our corporate responsibility programs, we engage with stakeholders and align our business activities to ensure that we meet our responsibilities to respond to the evolving needs of society and contribute as a partner to the overall health and wellness of the world.",,,
"CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY gOvERNANCE The charter of Pfizer’s Board of Directors’ Corporate Governance Committee now requires directors “to maintain an informed status on company issues related to corporate social responsibility and the company’s participation and visibility as a global corporate citizen, and to monitor emerging issues potentially affecting the reputation of the pharmaceutical industry and the company.” This year, to improve Board oversight of corporate responsibility, Pfizer’s Corporate Responsibility team has begun providing biannual corporate responsibility updates to the Corporate Governance Committee of Pfizer’s Board of Directors on specific progress on corporate responsibility goals.",,,
Most of Pfizer’s corporate responsibility issues are managed within our business units and corporate group.,,,
This ensures that corporate responsibility is directly integrated into all of our work.,,,
"Pfizer’s corporate responsibility efforts are coordinated globally by a team that is part of Worldwide Communications, whose leader is a member of executive leadership and reports directly to the CEO.",,,
"The Corporate Responsibility team, led by the Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, is responsible for setting the strategic direction for corporate responsibility at Pfizer and supporting integration of corporate responsibility throughout the company.",,,
"The Corporate Responsibility team also oversees the development of Pfizer’s corporate responsibility reports and communications, and manages engagement and partnerships with socially responsible investors and nongovernmental organizations.",,,
"This year, we integrated our philanthropy function into our broader corporate responsibility function to better align our philanthropic programs with our corporate responsibility and business priorities.",,,
The Corporate Responsibility team is also responsible for the development and oversight of Pfizer’s global health programs described in the Access to Medicines section of this report.,,,
"INTE gRATION Of C ORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Integrating corporate responsibility into our business requires continuous effort to set the right priorities, allocate resources appropriately, and communicate and partner with stakeholders.",,,
This is especially challenging given the scale and scope of our company and our geographic diversity.,,,
"To facilitate this process, we created a new Global Corporate Responsibility Colleague Network to connect all Pfizer colleagues who have corporate responsibility-related roles.",,,
"This network helps implement global strategies at the local level, and identify and share information about emerging issues and best practices with the Corporate Responsibility team and peers around the world.7 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT www.pfizer.com/responsibilityStakeholder Engagement Our relationships with stakeholders are fundamental to improving our corporate responsibility efforts.",,,
"Engagement with Pfizer’s stakeholders helps us understand the larger context and impacts of our operations, learn about expectations for our performance, and assess emerging issues that may affect our business.",,,
We operate with a stakeholder model that recognizes the inherent interconnectedness of the goals of Pfizer and its stakeholders.,,,
This model informs an approach to engagement that moves beyond transactions between Pfizer and individual stakeholders to a network of connected organizations that all have important roles in addressing social and environmental issues.,,,
This approach has helped us identify mutual perspectives and goals with stakeholders and to take a more collaborative approach to these relationships.,,,
Our overarching goal is the same —improved global health and prosperity.,,,
We have received essential input from stakeholders over the last two years.,,,
"For example, in April 2008, stakeholders from more than a dozen public and private organizations met with Pfizer Global Operations leaders from around the world to help us develop our new Global Access to Medicines strategy.",,,
These stakeholders helped us define the opportunities and expectations associated with work in this area.,,,
Many of these stakeholders have become engaged partners in building this new approach to access.,,,
"Throughout the report, we have highlighted stakeholder feedback.",,,
Please look for these to learn more about how we engage with stakeholders and how they view our performance.,,,

The purpose of our public policy engagement is to create an enabling environment to improve access to medicines and health care.,,,
Effective public policies can help create an environment in which innovative new prescription medicines are brought to market at costs society can afford.,,,
"We understand the complexity of the health care challenges facing the world, and further recognize that our role extends beyond discovering, developing and delivering pharmaceutical products.",,,
We also have a role in helping to find solutions to the systemic barriers to health care.,,,
"At Pfizer, we are facing mounting pressures in the external environment on our commercial model—from growing pressures to increase transparency in pricing models and clinical trials, to changing standards for responsible product promotion, to the need to identify and manage risk ourselves rather than relying on regulatory agencies for oversight.",,,
"Similarly, we are also acutely aware of the increasing role of government in addressing health care issues, and that this will have a direct effect on our ability to achieve commercial success and meet our obligations to stakeholders.",,,
"In response to these pressures, we are engaging with governments around the world, as well as with private and public institutions, and our industry peers to address a wide range of policy issues.",,,
"These include policies that would limit the choices of doctors and patients, potentially dilute intellectual property protection, impose price controls on health care products and services, and allow the unfettered importation of medicines across national borders.",,,
"Our policy positions are based on the following longstanding principles: • Promoting access to quality health care • Patient preference• Clinician autonomy• Openness and flexibility with regard to new business models to increase access to medicines • Market-based competition• Transparency throughout the business • Protection for information contained in patents and clinical data that maintains incentives for innovation 3 read mOre a T www.PfIzER.COm/POLICY At Pfizer, we recognize that to continue to put patients at the core of our mission will require us to be even more active in our approach to public policy.",,,
"Our new approach is driven by two key insights: we must expand our engagement with all stakeholders, and we must be a more proactive participant in the discussions and debates that shape health care policy in order to promote better health now and for future generations.",,,
"Pfizer is currently taking steps to engage with a much broader range of stakeholders, including nongovernmental organizations, multilateral organizations, academic institutions and labor unions to discuss viewpoints, candidly and thoroughly, with our critics.",,,
These relationships are being centered more on collectively developing health care solutions and less on reaction to the loudest or most visible stakeholders.,,,
"We are also driving more partnerships at local levels so that we have strong relationships with the communities where we live and work, and ensure we remain connected to the needs and constraints of our customers.",,,
Expanded engagement supports Pfizer’s need to be more proactive on policy issues.,,,
"By enabling us to identify emerging issues and anticipate the direction of policy debates, engagement helps us encourage outcomes that benefit society over the long term, and sustains our ability to produce new medicines for unmet medical needs.",,,
"For example, we have become more active on issues of U.S. health care reform.",,,
More information on our efforts in health care reform is provided in the Access to Medicines section of this report.,,,
We are also working with governments around the world on issues of access to medicines as well as health care delivery and financing.,,,
"For example, Pfizer CEO, Jeff Kindler, has testified to Congress on proposed policy solutions to balance the need to provide affordable access to medicines with intellectual property protection.",,,
"Following his testimony, Jeff partnered with Professor John Barton of Stanford University, an expert on intellectual property, to develop a practical policy vision to provide access to medicines in low- and middle-income countries while preserving incentives for innovation.",,,
This initiative underscores Pfizer’s willingness to be flexible and open to different approaches.,,,
Public policy positioning is a crucial component of achieving commercial and social sustainability at Pfizer.,,,
"Moving forward, we will continue to focus our efforts on expanding stakeholder engagement and taking a proactive leadership role in policy debates, particularly on health care reform.",,,
"We will also concentrate on developing a policy framework to support new and expanding product areas, such as vaccines, nutritionals, oncology and biologic medicines.",,,
"To demonstrate how our participation in public policy debates is helping us to fulfill our mission of working together for a healthier world, we have chosen to highlight several public policy positions and issues throughout this year’s report.",,,
Please look for these “Spotlight on Public Policy” features and visit the Public Policy section of our Web site for more information.,,,
We included information on our policy and lobbying efforts in the Governance section.,,,

"Although trust in business had already been dampened by corporate scandals and the collapse of a handful of businesses earlier in the decade, the current financial crisis has raised levels of public distrust of large multinational corporations to all-time highs.",,,
"At the same time, the role of government in regulating business and addressing societal needs has intensified dramatically.",,,
"Finally, environmental and social issues such as climate change and access to health care, once the purview of small groups of stakeholders, are now highly visible public policy issues.",,,
These shifts are rapidly changing expectations for business.,,,
Governments around the world are demanding that businesses improve transparency and adopt a more holistic perspective on creating value.,,,
"Several countries have passed legislation supporting, and, in some cases requiring, corporations to report on their social and environmental performance.",,,
"Increasingly investors are including aspects of corporate responsibility performance as indicators of strong corporate governance, risk management or overall management quality.",,,
And recent consumer surveys show that the demand for socially responsible products and services continues to intensify.,,,
"13 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT www.pfizer.com/responsibilityAt Pfizer, these developments have coincided with significant changes within our company.",,,
"We have reorganized to take advantage of our size and scale while committing to operate with the agility, speed and focus of an entrepreneurial organization.",,,
"We are also pursuing several strategies, including a greater focus on emerging markets and creating new opportunities for our established products—medicines that have lost, or will soon lose exclusivity.",,,
"We have integrated our global health programs into our broader corporate responsibility efforts to better align our philanthropic programs, corporate responsibility initiatives and business priorities.",,,
Our Executive Leadership T eam has championed the development of a new corporate responsibility strategy for Pfizer.,,,
"And most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire Wyeth, the fifth-largest pharmaceutical company in the U.S. We recognize it is not just “what we do” that matters, but also “how we do it” that defines corporate responsibility at Pfizer.",,,
We face many challenges in meeting these new responsibilities.,,,
How can we manage our growth responsibly while also responsibly handling contractions in our business?,,,
How can we embed our approach to responsibility into decision-making in all parts of the business and all places where we do business?,,,
And how can we capitalize on the proposed Wyeth acquisition to meet the ever-evolving expectations of our stakeholders?,,,
www.pfizer.com/responsibilit y 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 14 The N ew e Ra Of ResPON sIBILIT y We are committed to doing things differently—including taking a new approach to continue to build trust in our business and satisfy the needs of people today while protecting the interests of tomorrow’s generation.,,,
"To meet these new responsibilities, Pfizer will need to increase the integration of corporate responsibility issues into our business and expand our collaborations with all stakeholders.",,,
"Our activities over the last two years have set us on the path to meeting these objectives, and we are making additional efforts to ensure that we meet society’s expectations as our company grows.",,,
ouR AppRoACh 15 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT www.pfizer.com/responsibility This new era of responsibility will require that companies move beyond a corporate responsibility outlook that only addresses certain “corporate responsibility issues” to make responsibility part of all business operations.,,,
"At Pfizer, we have taken several steps to improve the integration of responsibility into our business processes and goals.",,,
"For example, although we have a very robust portfolio of philanthropic and collaborative programs to provide access to our medicines, we have taken the next step toward making access a key consideration in all of our business in the developing world by building a new Global Access strategy in our Emerging Markets Business Unit.",,,
"This strategy, described in more detail in the Access to Medicines section of this report, will explore commercially viable and socially responsible opportunities to market our products to underserved populations around the world.",,,
"We are also exploring exciting new opportunities that may develop from Pfizer’s planned acquisition of Wyeth, particularly in the vaccines, consumer health care products, and nutritionals businesses that are now part of Wyeth.",,,
Pfizer is also building on the strengths of our environmental program to enhance sustainable practices throughout our businesses.,,,
"While we are proud of our environmental initiatives and our many achievements over the years, the objective is to develop a more integrated and strategic approach.",,,
"This includes creating a framework to prioritize short- and long-term environmental activities, a basis for communicating and engaging with stakeholders and a foundation that aligns with Pfizer’s overall corporate responsibility platform to reduce our environmental impact on a global basis.",,,
We have also developed a new Global Colleague Network to link Pfizer colleagues around the world who have corporate responsibility-related responsibilities.,,,
"The Network is designed to ensure global alignment on corporate responsibility policies and practices and help integrate responsibility issues throughout our business units.INTE gRATION 1www.pfizer.com/responsibilit y 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 16 The N ew e Ra Of ResPON sIBILIT y At Pfizer, we recognize that our business doesn’t operate in a vacuum and is intricately connected to the world’s health care systems.",,,
"We are taking steps to become more active in policy debates, such as health care reform in the U.S. We are earnestly engaging in discussions and dialogue with governments and other key policy stakeholders to ensure that policies support our ability to bring innovative prescription medicines to market and that patients are able to receive the medicines they need.",,,
We also appreciate that real partnerships are required to meet our responsibilities within our supply chain.,,,
"For several years now, Pfizer has been monitoring our suppliers to ensure that our business with them does not indirectly create negative effects on the environment and that workers’ rights are protected.",,,
"However, monitoring is not sufficient to minimize effects and guarantee good labor conditions.",,,
"In many cases, our suppliers are eager to meet our standards for responsible business but lack the knowledge or capacity to improve their operations.",,,
"To help address this, we have created several initiatives and participated in a number of partnerships that are detailed further in the Manufacturing & Supply Chain section of this report.COLLABORATION 217 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT www.pfizer.com/responsibility www.pfizer.com/responsibilit y 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 18 The N ew e Ra Of ResPON sIBILIT y 19 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT www.pfizer.com/responsibility We have taken many steps over the last two years to make more information about our business available to the public.",,,
"For instance, we recognize that there are questions about the strength of governance at global corporations.",,,
We are committed to communicating openly about our governance structures and processes.,,,
"In the Governance section of this report, for example, we have reported on our efforts to revise our executive compensation policy to address stakeholder concerns.",,,
We also understand the importance of providing clearer information about our medicines and science.,,,
We are now making the results of all our clinical trials available through the Research & Developmen t section of our Web site.,,,
"These disclosures discuss our approaches and protocols for trials, as well as all results, favorable and unfavorable of these trials.",,,
"We have also begun disclosing all the grants and charitable contributions Pfizer makes to U.S.-based medical, scientific and patient organizations.",,,
We have announced our intention to begin disclosing payments to U.S. doctors and clinicians outside our company who do critical work with us.,,,
"And we have put on our Web site one of the world’s most comprehensive guides to the safety of medicines, giving patients much more information for assessing the benefits and risks of medications they are taking or considering.CLARITY AND CANDOR 3www.pfizer.com/responsibilit y 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 20 The N ew e Ra Of ResPON sIBILIT y21 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT www.pfizer.com/responsibility As we write this report, the world around us continues to change, as do expectations of business.",,,
Our responsibility is to meet those expectations head-on.,,,
"We have a vision of Pfizer continuing to improve lives around the world, not just for those who take our medicines but also for those whom our business touches.",,,
"We believe that Pfizer’s planned acquisition of Wyeth will position us to better meet these challenges and that through further integration of corporate responsibility into our business, collaboration and clarity and candor in all that we do, we are on the right path the meet the challenges of this new era of responsibility.looking foR wARD22ReseARCh & DeVelopment23 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT www.pfizer.com/responsibilityAs advances in medical care help more and more people live longer lives, the need for new medicines to keep people healthy continues to grow.",,,

"While scientific knowledge and health care products and services have advanced exponentially over the last generation, millions of people around the world still die from preventable and curable diseases because they lack access to basic medicines and medical services.",,,
Disparities in health and health care remain pervasive and problematic.,,,
The World Health Organization estimates that one-third of the world’s population is unable to get even the cheapest essential drugs for common diseases.,,,
"And this issue is not limited to the developing world—in the current economic environment, individuals in developed nations increasingly face serious challenges in obtaining good-quality medical care.",,,
The implications of existing disparities are dramatic.,,,
"Poor health impedes individuals’ ability to seek educational opportunities, to attain regular employment and to reach full lifespans.",,,
"Disparities in health and health care are not only a burden on communities and individuals, but are also a considerable cost to our society.",,,
The barriers to access are significant and entrenched throughout health care systems.,,,
"In developing countries, health care infrastructures are often inadequate to provide care and distribute medicines, and in the developed world, these systems are often beyond the reach of the uninsured.",,,
"Additionally, pharmaceutical companies have not traditionally focused on diseases of the developing world due to the limited potential for return on investment, especially considering the extent of investment required for novel drug development.",,,
PfIzER’S APPROAC h We believe that improving access to medicines around the world is one of our most pressing responsibilities.,,,
"We recognize that we have yet to meet our full potential, as reflected in pharmaceutical company rankings such as the Access to Medicines Index ranking, and value the feedback and insights provided by the many stakeholders we engage and partner with on access to medicine issues.",,,
"This year, we launched a two-pronged approach to help people get the medicines and services they need: • A Global Access Strategy within the Emerging Markets Business Unit, dedicated to exploring and developing new business models that will improve access to quality medicines in a commercially viable, socially responsible manner to patients facing cost as a barrier to basic health care.",,,
• A robust portfolio of global health programs to improve access for patients and build health care capacity globally.,,,
"We believe that by integrating our new commercial access strategy into the business, and supplementing it with strong global health programs, Pfizer will be best positioned to meet public health needs in a sustainable manner, now and in the future.Building a Sustainable Global Access Strategy Approximately 4 billion people, 72 percent of the world’s population, live on less than three dollars a day.",,,
"In general, these individuals do not have regular access to essential health care.",,,
"Instead, most of their care is focused on acute and emergency care, and quality care delivered by trained health care workers is often unaffordable.",,,
Providing good-quality health care (including medications) to this population remains one of the most challenging and urgent humanitarian issues of our time.,,,
"As a global health care company, Pfizer acknowledges the depth of these global health challenges, yet we see these statistics as indicators of opportunity as well as challenges.",,,
"Between 50 to 90 percent of annual total health care expenditures by the world’s poorest people, approximately $30 billion annually, goes to pay for medicines.",,,
This represents an extraordinary business opportunity for Pfizer to address the needs of a traditionally neglected consumer.,,,
"aCC ess TO me DICIN es www.pfizer.com/responsibilit y 2009 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 30Our recognition of these opportunities, along with input from many global health organizations, has led to the creation of a Global Access team within the new Emerging Markets Business Unit.",,,
"In many developing countries, health care infrastructures are weak and funded through governments or charitable organizations, and awareness of disease prevention and health care is limited.",,,
Approaching the underserved as valued patients and customers offers new opportunities and challenges for Pfizer.,,,

Pfizer and Grameen Health will jointly evaluate ways to improve Grameen Health’s existing health care delivery systems and primary care clinics in rural Bangladesh with the goal of identifying appropriate business models that ultimately can be replicated in other countries.,,,
"We have also developed a partnership with PlaNet Finance, a nongovernmental organization that works in more than 60 countries to alleviate poverty through the development of microfinance and microinsurance.",,,
"Through this partnership, we will assess existing sources and availability of medicines, patient purchasing patterns, and the level of access to medical services among the working poor in China, a population of approximately 500 million.",,,
"With findings from the research, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2009, Pfizer and PlaNet Finance will work to identify models that will help improve access to medicines and health care services in China.",,,
"We recognize that pricing and licensing are important issues to our stakeholders and we are committed to continuing to explore these tools, particularly as we develop our global access strategy.Throughout 2009, the Global Access team will launch additional pilot programs to assess the strategies above.",,,
"For instance, we will explore how new business partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies can expand our ability to develop and distribute medicines to underserved patients.",,,

"Historically, much of the conversation has focused on how the burden of providing access can be shared between pharmaceutical companies and governments.",,,
Companies have also struggled with how to balance meeting the global needs for access with the challenges and costs of research and development.,,,
"Moving forward, Pfizer, in conjunction with stakeholders and partners, will attempt to reframe this debate by focusing less on the tension between philanthropic access and commercial success and more on creating a socially and commercially sustainable Global Access Strategy.",,,
"We recognize that there will continue to be challenges around the prices of medicines and health care delivery, especially in the developing world.",,,
"For many people, any price is cost-prohibitive, and we will need to continue to partner with our stakeholders to find ways to provide access to necessary medicines for those who may be left out of a commercial business model.",,,
"We also believe that medicines are only one component of providing access to health, and we therefore remain committed to our programs to build capacity for health care delivery around the world.devastating diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.",,,

Pharmaceutical counterfeiting is on the rise globally—the WHO estimates that while less than 1 percent of medicines in developed countries are counterfeit this increases to between 10 and 30 percent in developing countries.,,,
This risks the health of millions of patients who take for granted that their prescription medicines are both safe and effective.,,,
"Counterfeit medicines often lack the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the authentic product, depriving patients of the expected therapeutic benefit.",,,
"Worse yet, counterfeit medicines may include toxic materials.",,,

"Of the approximately 45 million counterfeit tablets seized by authorities since 2004, 11.1 million were seized in 2008 alone, nearly 29 percent over 2007.",,,
Pfizer has established business practices to secure the distribution system and has increased cooperation with law enforcement agencies to prosecute counterfeiters and promote public policies that reduce counterfeiting.,,,

"All are independent except Jeff Kindler, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and William C. Steere Jr., Pfizer’s Chairman Emeritus since 2001.",,,
"Pfizer holds annual elections for directors, in connection with which the Corporate Governance Committee reviews the qualifications of all directors, evaluating skills and talents to assure a balance of disciplines and perspectives.",,,
The Corporate Governance Committee also seeks to further enhance the Board through gender and ethnic diversity.,,,
"Pfizer’s Board of Directors follows a set of Corporate Governance Principles and conducts an annual review to assure that the Principles are timely and effective, and supports the Board’s oversight and accountability on behalf of shareholders.",,,
"With a keen awareness of the importance of independent oversight on behalf of shareholders, the Board voted in early 2009 to remove the presumption that the role of Chairman of the Board would be held by the Chief Executive Officer.",,,
"Instead, the Principles now provide that the Board will annually elect a Chairman of the Board, who may or may not be the CEO.",,,
"If the individual elected as Chairman of the Board is the CEO, the independent directors will also elect a Lead Independent Director whose responsibilities include calling meetings of the independent directors and presiding over executive sessions of the independent directors.",,,

Executive Compensation Executive compensation has become a principal topic of discussion for many of our stakeholders.,,,
"At Pfizer, the compensation of our Executive Leadership T eam (the CEO and the executive officers reporting directly to him) is determined by the Compensation Committee.",,,
"Specifically, the Committee has direct responsibility for establishing annual and long-term performance goals and objectives for the CEO and reviewing the goals approved by the CEO for the other members of the Executive Leadership T eam.",,,
"Our current Chairman and CEO, Jeff Kindler, was elected to these positions in 2006.",,,
His compensation is set by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board.,,,
"Jeff Kindler does not have an employment contract, and his retirement benefits are based on the same formula as for other salaried employees.",,,
"In support of our philosophy to align the interests of the executive officers with those of our shareholders, Pfizer executives are required to own Pfizer common stock equal in value to a multiple of salary, ranging from at least five times salary for our CEO to at least four times salary for the other members of our Executive Leadership T eam.",,,
Ownership must be achieved over a five-year period.,,,
"As a result of a comprehensive evaluation of our compensation programs and practices that commenced in 2007, including feedback from shareholders, the Compensation Committee has taken several actions to redesign elements of our compensation programs to assure that they (a) are aligned with our pay for performance philosophy and our shareholders’ interests, and (b) are an effective tool to attract, motivate and retain executive management.",,,

"At Pfizer’s 2009 annual meeting, its shareholders approved, by a majority of the votes cast, a non binding proposal asking the Board of Directors to give shareholders an advisory “say on pay” vote.",,,
"Because of Pfizer’s direct engagement with its investor community about executive compensation and other important governance issues, the Board had recommended a vote against this proposal.",,,

It should be noted that often facilities are divested to other companies with an agreement to supply Pfizer for several years.,,,
This allows the acquiring company to develop additional business to make the plant sustainable.,,,
"We never make these decisions lightly, realizing how difficult they are for our colleagues and their families who are impacted.",,,
"However, we believe that the cumulative benefit to Pfizer will be a more focused, streamlined and competitive manufacturing operation.",,,
PGM is establishing a competitive “make or buy” supply network.,,,
We expect to increase outsourced manufacturing of products from approximately 17 percent to 30 percent over the next three years.,,,
"Key considerations for outsourcing decisions include the ability to supply, capacity flexibility, cost competitiveness, and technology, while assuring supply chain integrity/reliability, product quality, and regulatory compliance.",,,
Any potential supplier is evaluated on its ability to produce material in a manner that is fully compliant with all regulatory requirements.,,,
"Global Contract Manufacturing and Supply Chain Procurement Global Contract Manufacturing (GCM) is part of PGM, responsible for managing approximately 150 contract manufacturers (CM) around the world.",,,
"The GCM team is organized geographically with teams based in Brazil, Belgium, Singapore and the U.S.",,,

Suppliers who do not meet Pfizer’s quality requirements are not permitted to enter or remain in the supply chain until they are able to fulfill the requirements.,,,
"In limited cases, Pfizer has located experienced quality professionals onsite who provide day-to-day support for a set period of time.",,,
Pfizer uses innovative technology to protect the supply chain.,,,
The use of sophisticated analytical and tracking tools has been critical in identifying not only counterfeit products but also their sources.,,,
Pfizer works closely with government agencies to remove counterfeits from the supply chain thus benefiting the patient population.,,,

Assessment and Improvement of EHS and Labor Practices at Key Suppliers Pfizer is committed to using suppliers that demonstrate acceptable performance in both EHS and labor practices.,,,
"Assessments help Pfizer manage business continuity, liability and reputation risks, while ensuring supply decisions align with company values.",,,
EHS and labor assessments are conducted for all new suppliers that meet certain criteria.,,,
Repeat evaluations are conducted periodically once a supply agreement is implemented.,,,
"Pfizer’s onsite assessment of EHS and labor practices focuses on suppliers providing materials and services specific to the pharmaceutical industry, notably research and development, production of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished-dosage-form medicinal products.",,,
"To safeguard against potential business interruption, we have included key outsourced logistics centers into the assessment program.",,,
"Currently, suppliers who provide basic commodity raw materials and services are not within the scope of the assessment program.",,,

"Pfizer expects its key suppliers to implement PSCI’s Pharmaceutical Industry Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management, which are available at www.pharmaceuticalsupplychain.org.",,,
"The need to complete an onsite assessment is driven by several factors and includes location, type and scale of manufacturing, product hazard characteristics, and supply criticality.",,,
Suppliers are assessed against Pfizer’s EHS and Labor “Supplier Expectations” which are based on Pfizer’s internal standards.,,,
"Suppliers are assessed as either acceptable, requiring improvement or significantly below expected standards.",,,
During 2008 a total of 97 onsite assessments of supplier facilities were completed with a further 18 visits to closely monitor performance and verify closure of improvement items.,,,
During the last five years of the assessment program more than 400 new or existing supplier facilities have been reviewed through onsite inspection.,,,
"Of those facilities, 41 were identified as requiring improvement with 32 falling significantly below expected standards.",,,
"At the end of 2008, Pfizer had supply relationships with 20 facilities that require improvement and a further six that are significantly below expected standards.",,,
"Facilities requiring improvement are visited frequently to monitor corrective action plans and, depending on risks identified, are also a focus of Pfizer’s coaching and capacity building programs.",,,
"Efforts to improve facilities falling significantly below standards are also completed, as well as development of exit strategies to alternate suppliers.",,,
"In 2008, a total of eight facilities improved their rating from requiring improvement to acceptable; however, two facilities unfortunately saw a rating drop from “requiring improvement” to “falling significantly below expected standards.” Pfizer has been notified or made aware of EHS incidents within the supply chain.",,,
"In the majority of cases, Pfizer reviews incident investigations to understand root causes and corrective actions.",,,
"Where possible, Pfizer EHS colleagues visit the supplier facilities for an onsite evaluation to verify investigations and to provide guidance when needed (this was not always possible for significant events where regulator restrictions took priority).",,,
Coaching and Training Our Suppliers Pfizer allocates resources to helping suppliers improve EHS performance and began providing training on a formal basis in 2006 to key suppliers in China and expanded in 2007 to cover India.,,,

"Unfortunately this has not been seen in all companies that attended the training, with two demonstrating a decrease in performance.",,,
Additional steps are being developed for these suppliers.,,,
Increasing Supplier Diversity The objective of our Supplier Diversity program is to build a supplier base that reflects the changing demographics of the consumer marketplace while helping Pfizer increase market share and shareholder value.,,,
"In order to do this, we have implemented the following four-part strategy: • Create opportunities through our sourcing process to increase our spending with minority and women-owned businesses.",,,

"Diversity & Inclusion Studies have demonstrated that when diverse viewpoints are considered, better business decisions are made.",,,
"Pfizer prizes diversity, not only in visible characteristics such as gender, age and ethnicity, but also in underlying characteristics such as thinking styles, life experiences and sexual orientation.",,,

"It also takes a commitment to inclusion, where all people feel valued, involved, supported and respected, and where ideas from all sources are given a fair hearing through the decision making processes of the enterprise.",,,
"Since our last report, Pfizer has developed an integrated diversity and inclusion (D&I) strategy that encompasses colleagues, customers, suppliers and the communities where Pfizer people work and live.",,,
"The overarching D&I strategy—which is driven through each of Pfizer’s business units and is the responsibility of each senior business leader—includes a global women’s strategy, a multicultural strategy, and a strategy to build upon colleague resource groups, such as the Latino Network in the United States.to continuously seek opportunities for progress.",,,
"We believe that employee engagement launches a virtuous cycle of better performance (including productivity, profitability, retention and safety) leading to even higher levels of engagement.",,,
Enabling and empowering colleagues begins by ensuring that they are informed on how the business is developing and how problems are being met and overcome.,,,
We have also created many avenues to increase communications throughout the organization.,,,
"For example, company-wide Town Halls, which follow each quarterly report on our financial performance, provide an opportunity to explain how business strategies are being implemented and to detail how investors are responding to Pfizer’s financial reporting.",,,
"Conducted by webcast, these meetings also provide a forum for answering questions directly from colleagues around the world.",,,

"While the challenges and opportunities discussed vary from meeting to meeting, the key continuing link is the desire to mold our company’s culture into one where leadership can be exhibited by every colleague, at every level.",,,
This is an important vehicle for the executive leadership team to get direct input from colleagues who are deep in the business or field.,,,

,"As a healthcare company, we understand human rights to be of the utmost relevance to our business, given the right to health’s wide-ranging interconnections to other fundamental rights.",,
,"Our responsibility to respect human rights extends across our entire product portfolio, but the pandemic has helped create an amplified urgency to ensure equitable access to vaccines and treatments against COVID-19.",,
,Equity is a core value of our company and has been the north star of our COVID-19 response.,,
,"Clinical trial diversity played an important role in our COVID-19 vaccine development program, where we ensured that historically underrepresented participants had access to our COVID-19 vaccine trials, and where we enrolled racially and ethnically diverse participants reflecting the patient population where the burden of disease has been higher.",,
,It has also driven our ongoing collaboration with governments and key stakeholders around the world to work towards fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines while also providing our expertise and resources for novel approaches to help strengthen healthcare systems where greater support may be needed.,,
,We recognize that there is a lot of interest in every aspect of our work in relation to access to the COVID-19 vaccine and treatment and are grateful for all feedback.,,
,We remain open to and welcome partnership for new and creative ways to reach more people.,,
,"In order to accelerate our efforts to reach vulnerable populations, we pledged to provide 2 billion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to low- and middle-income countries in 2021 and 2022 – at least 1 billion doses each year.",,
,Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income countries are currently home to 75% of the world’s population and 62% of the world’s poor.,,
,"We fulfilled this pledge in December 2021, with more than 1 billion doses delivered to 100 low- and middle- income countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Jordan, Ukraine, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia – among many others.",,
,"As part of this strategy, Pfizer is a proud partner and top contributor to the COVAX facility, a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by the GAVI vaccine alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the World Health Organization, alongside key delivery partners UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization.",,
,"In 2021, Pfizer worked with COVAX and government partners to enable supply of more than 250 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, more than 25% of the total COVAX supply in 2021.",,
,"The U.S. Government was a critical partner in this effort, committing to purchase 1 billion doses at the not-for-profit price to donate to the 92 COVAX Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) countries as well as the member states of the African Union that are not already part of the AMC 92.",,
,"More than 200 million of these doses were delivered in 2021, and the remaining 800 million will be delivered through 2022.",,
,"Moving at the Speed of Science to Address a Global Crisis Our Ongoing Mission to Help Ensure Equitable Global Access to the COVID-19 Vaccines & Treatments COVID-19 Vaccine distribution showing the 166 countries and territories where Pfizer doses were received in 2021 Pfizer 2021 ESG Report16 Vaccine Distribution and Partnerships We know that it won’t just be vaccines that will help bring an end to this pandemic, but vaccinations.",,
,Country readiness is critical in ensuring that vaccinations are successful.,,
,"Based on our experience working with Ministries of Health and multilateral organizations during the unprecedented scale up of vaccination campaigns, we have seen multiple issues when it comes to supply planning and delivery, including, the ability to properly maintain product handling requirements, the availability of sufficient ultra-cold-chain (UCC) and traditional cold chain capacity, availability of essential supplies such as syringes and diluent, and resource and training limitations as well as lower uptake rates due to hesitancy.",,
,"Without cold chain support, countries are not able to accept high volumes of vaccine that allow for robust and comprehensive vaccination campaigns.",,
,"And, without service delivery and sufficient workforce capacity, vaccines in country will not result in vaccinations.",,
,"Distributing these types of products rapidly and at national scale has no precedent in modern public health, and close coordination across all stakeholders is critical for ensuring the success of vaccination campaigns.",,
,Continued investment in readiness efforts in many lower income countries are still necessary to ensure that vaccines shipped effectively reach populations.,,
,"We continue to partner with the global health community, governments and private industry to address these challenges.",,
,As a few key examples: • Pfizer and the UPS Foundation are committed to accelerating the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations.,,
,"The UPS Foundation is donating freezers to countries that need assistance with building out their ultra-cold chain capacity, and Pfizer provides guidance and experience in product supply.",,
,"Our partnership leverages innovation in the healthcare cold chain to move our world forward by safely, securely and quickly delivering vaccines to areas where they are needed most.",,
,"• As part of a four-year partnership with Zipline, Pfizer is supporting an innovative pilot initiative in Ghana, focused on delivering vaccines requiring cold-chain storage to hard-to-reach areas using drones.",,
,The initial success of the project suggests that the program could be quickly expanded to deliver doses of COVID-19 vaccines to remote regions across the world where Zipline operates.,,
,• Pfizer has signed a memorandum of understanding with Global Environment and Technology Foundation to collaborate with Project Last Mile.,,
,"The partnership is focused on aligning the supply chain expertise and technical capabilities of Coca-Cola, a company whose supply chain is characterized as one of the widest reaching in the world, with technical expertise from Pfizer on vaccine handling, storage and administration in order to improve the availability of vaccines in developing countries, and, in particular, to those residing in and around the last mile of the medical supply chain in Africa.COVID-19 Moving at the Speed of Science to Address a Global Crisis — Continued COVID-19 vaccines arrive in Botswana Pfizer is supporting an innovative pilot initiative in Ghana, focused on delivering vaccines requiring cold- chain storage to hard-to-reach areas using drones Impact StoriesPfizer 2021 ESG Report17 Through our ongoing efforts and initiatives, we remain fully focused on getting high-quality, safe and effective vaccines to patients all over the world as quickly as possible to help end the COVID-19 pandemic.",,

,"This past August, we continued to focus our efforts by reapplying an ESG lens to our capital raising strategies by issuing a second Sustainability Bond, this time raising $1.0 billion.",,
,"We followed the same path as we did in 2020, by assembling a cross-functional team to assess the benefits associated with issuing a second Sustainability Bond.",,
,"We leveraged the Sustainability Bond Framework we established in 2020 when we issued the biopharmaceutical industry’s first such bond, which raised $1.25 billion.",,
,"Proceeds from the 2020 Sustainability Bond are being used to help manage our environmental impact and to support increased patient access to Pfizer’s medicines and vaccines, especially among underserved populations, and to strengthen health care systems.",,
,"Proceeds from the August 2021 Sustainability Bond were used to support the research and development (R&D) expenses related to our COVID-19 vaccine R&D, and capital expenditures in connection with the manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.",,
,"From day one, Pfizer’s strategy to address COVID-19 has been anything but business as usual.",,
,Our goal has been and will continue to be scaling capacity to provide enough COVID-19 vaccine doses on an equitable basis to reach all who choose it.,,
,"On the R&D front, we considered the social impact of the vaccine in the Phase 3 clinical trial R&D process, which included a diversity of countries, diversity in race and ethnicity, and diversity in age categories.",,
,"Given the impact of the pandemic on people living in low- and middle-income countries and the need to bolster public health systems, we believe directing resources towards these COVID-19 investments qualified under the International Capital Market Association’s Social Bond Principles.",,
,"Demand for ESG bonds has surged, following the increased investor focus on environmental issues and economic inequality.",,
,In 2020 there was $800 billion in global sustainable debt issuance.,,
,"That figure more than doubled in 2021 to $1.6 trillion, including $530 billion in sustainability-linked loans and bonds.1 Pfizer’s two Sustainability Bonds issuances enabled us to publicly highlight our efforts in the ESG space.",,

,,"Under this process, we conduct operational risk evaluations (OREs), which are structured evaluations of risks with the potential to have a substantive impact on Pfizer.",
,,The process assesses the effectiveness of controls in place to manage or mitigate risk.,
,,Climate change risk is evaluated by a team that includes relevant cross-functional program leaders and subject matter experts.,
,,"The Climate Change ORE is designed to assess potential risk to Pfizer across four risk factors: external and reputational, physical, regulatory and legal, and market and technology risks.",
,,"Individual risks across each of the four risk factors are evaluated and rated based on considerations such as the severity, vulnerability, and risk to Pfizer to ensure that sufficient controls are in place to mitigate climate change risks and prevent material impact to Pfizer.",
,,"The higher the severity and the vulnerability, the higher we score overall risk.",
,,"Based on the risk scores, we prioritize action.",
,,"Of the TCFD categories of climate risks, we have determined that physical risk presents the highest potential risk to our operations.",
,,"Pfizer uses tools such as Swiss Re CatNet to monitor short-, medium- and long-term physical threats to internal operations and for more than 5,000 contract manufacturers and material suppliers.",
,,"Risks identified through these assessments are reviewed as part of the ORE, and mitigation of risk is monitored through Pfizer's Business Resilience program and monitored by and escalated to company leadership as needed.",
,,"Acute and chronic physical risks related to climate change are managed through Pfizer’s Business Resilience program at the enterprise and local levels and provide input on the potential impact of physical risks that may be related to climate change (e.g., severe weather events, flooding).",
,,Reputational risks are managed through our process to transparently disclose information related to our climate change program and engage with key stakeholders to help lead the conversation on voluntary actions companies can take to address their GHG emissions.Regulatory risks are managed through regulatory development tracking and analysis enabled by our Legal and GEHS teams.,
,,Market and technology risks are monitored and managed through our Global EHS and Business Continuity risk management process.,
,,"Pfizer has integrated the climate change risk assessments described above into divisional and enterprise risk management processes, which includes a periodic review of risk that could be material to the company.",
,,"Metrics and Targets In an effort to mitigate the acute and chronic physical impacts of climate change on our operations (e.g., more severe weather events, population displacement), Pfizer has taken steps to voluntarily reduce our GHG emissions in line with a science-based target and is working with key suppliers to do the same.",
,,We expect our sites and suppliers to have fully implemented business continuity and disaster recovery plans and require our internal sites to maintain energy master plans that identify conservation opportunities.,
,,Pfizer calculates Scope 1 and 2 emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol (revised edition).,
,,Our 2019 GHG footprint (including Scope 3 categories 1-8 and 15) was independently assured pursuant to International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised) by ERM Certification and Verification Services and verification of 2020 data is underway.,
,,"Emissions are reported annually in our CDP response and are broken down by type, country and business division.",
,,"We also track metrics relative to our business continuity and disaster recovery programs (e.g., number of supplier assessments completed; sites with fully implemented plans for the management of risk associated with natural perils such as flooding and severe weather, noting it is not possible to state with certainty whether individual weather events are a result of climate change).",
,,"Pfizer discloses our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions annually through our CDP Response and publishes our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in our ESG Report (formerly in our Annual Review) and on our website.We exceeded our 2012-2020 climate goal, delivering a 33% reduction in GHG emissions from our 2012 baseline 1.",

,,,"In today’s world, being a responsible company is the only smart way to operate in both the short-term and long-term."
,,,"To be responsible and accountable—socially, ethically and environmentally—is to be trusted."
,,,We need that trust to serve our diverse stakeholders and support a sustainable enterprise.
,,,"We know trust is built over time with actions, not words."
,,,This report reflects progress in our actions and acknowledges areas where we still need to improve.
,,,"Corporate Responsibility and the Board of Directors The Pfizer Board of Directors’ Corporate Governance Committee charter requires directors to “consider the perspectives of stakeholders in the company’s decisions regarding current and emerging political, social and public policy issues.” The Board receives information about stakeholder perceptions and opinions by various means including direct email from the public (see www.pfizer.com/corpgov), Pfizer senior executives’ reports, annual shareholder proposals, and Directors’ own personal and professional networks."
,,,Integration of Corporate Responsibility Integrating our corporate responsibility is not just updating data and meeting certain social responsibility codes.
,,,"It is about changing our behavior and resource allocation— changing the way we operate, communicate and partner with stakeholders."
,,,"On a daily basis, Pfizer Corporate Responsibility is managed globally by a team that is part of Worldwide Public Affairs and Policy."
,,,"The team is responsible for developing this CR report, establishing Pfizer’s CR partnerships with various socially responsible investors, nongovernmental and multilateral organizations, and coordinating with different global Pfizer functional and business areas."
,,,The team’s focus is to foster and support integration of CR throughout the company with a strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement.
,,,The team also serves as an internal-external bridge to foster communication for new ideas.
,,,We integrate corporate responsibility into how we engage on policy issues and even how we develop our medicines.
,,,"For example, see page 91 on the introduction of our smoking cessation medication Chantix ® (called Champix® in Europe)."
,,,About the Report We are pleased to issue Pfizer’s second report on our corporate responsibility approach and activities.

,,,"We share with them an overarching goal—good health for all people at manageable costs, and a healthcare system that is sustainable."
,,,Our relationships with stakeholders are at the heart of our corporate responsibility because they define what it means for Pfizer to create value.
,,,"That is why Jeff Kindler, after being named CEO in July 2006, and the new senior management team met with a variety of stakeholders."
,,,"They wanted to find out what was on stakeholders’ minds, what worked well—and what needed to be strengthened."
,,,Some of the company’s new priorities and actions are a result of these discussions.
,,,"Here are just some of the stakeholders our senior management met with in the past year: • American Heart Association • American Lung Association • American Medical Association • Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids • Easter Seals (disability services) • Institutional and other shareholders• International Alliance of Patients’ Organizations • National Alliance for the Mentally Ill • National and local government leaders• Organization for Economic and Cooperation Development (OECD) • Oxfam Great Britain and Oxfam America • Pfizer colleagues around the world• Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Management Association • Sheet Metal Workers International Association • Women Impacting Public Policy • World Health Organization Senior management heard a spectrum of comments from stakeholders, ranging from Pfizer being seen as an inflexible business partner, to questions about the stock price and from awe at Pfizer’s scientists for their skills and dedication, to surprise at the scope of our partnerships in improving access to medicines."
,,,"However, most stakeholders agree that, given the complexity of public health problems facing the world today, no single entity—government, corporation, academic institution, nongovernmental organization, civic organization or others—can solve healthcare issues alone."
,,,"It takes all of us working together, contributing our respective strengths."
,,,Some stakeholders have different views on how to achieve healthcare goals.
,,,Our challenge is to build on areas of agreement and find common ground.
,,,"To achieve this, we seek to constantly improve our communications and transparency, to listen and respond better to stakeholders, and to learn from them."
,,,We also share insights on how the pharmaceutical industry works as part of wider healthcare systems.
,,,We need strong and trusting partnerships to make progress on improving global health.
,,,"Given this reality, we will continue to engage stakeholders regularly and continue to share knowledge, skills and goals on how to prevent or manage diseases, get medicines to the people who need them, and promote good health among diverse populations."
,,,These partnerships take many forms— as described in this report.
,,,"Channels for Engaging Stakeholders: • Advisory boards on issues and products • Associations and networks for patient advocates • Conferences at international, regional and national levels • Dialogues with multicultural stakeholder groups• Email and letter responses • External compliance hotlines • Focus groups with different stakeholders• Grassroots outreach programs within communities • Management-employee advisory councils and “townhalls” • Media briefings and interviews with journalists• Meetings, briefings and feedback sessions with investors, customers, legislators and regulators • Partnerships in the field with NGOs and MLOs • Pfizer.com website interactive features • Professional trade associations for science and business • Sales calls to physicians • Surveys of colleagues and customers WHO Health Evidence Network www.euro.who.int/HEN Pfizer supports the important work of the World Health Organization (WHO) Health Evidence Network (HEN), which provides policymakers with independent and ready-to-use evidence-based information on public health and healthcare issues."
,,,HEN also provides easy access to other international databases and sources of information.
,,,The scope of HEN’s work corresponds with the 14 strategic technical objectives of WHO.
,,,"In 2007, based on stakeholder dialogue, we offered suggestions on potential healthcare topics and the creation of work groups and policy briefs to support public healthcare decision-makers while respecting their independence."

,,,"This is one way to give society a stronger “voice” within Pfizer—to employ in influential positions colleagues from biotech firms, patient advocacy groups, health professionals’ organizations, insurance providers, governments, think tanks and academia who influence our dialogue."
,,,This diversity changes how we think and operate at the very core of our business.
,,,"Changes on the day-to-day level, for example, are evident in our ACE (Aligning Customer Excellence) Program in Europe (page 84)."
,,,"We also engage directly with stakeholders through issue advisory boards, employee surveys, conferences, small meetings and public-private partnerships."
,,,Some approaches have predefined feedback and follow-up methods.
,,,Other approaches are more informal and help shape future goals and activities.
,,,"Following are two new initiatives from early 2007: Pharma Futures II: Prescription for Long-Term Value www.pharmafutures.or g A senior Pfizer executive participated in Pharma Futures II, a dialogue initiated by pension funds and pharmaceutical companies to create a better understanding among all participants about the significant challenges in the healthcare sector, and the pharmaceutical industry’s role in finding solutions with other stakeholders."
,,,"Pension funds included ABP Netherlands, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, and the Universities Superannuation Scheme in the UK."
,,,"Participants discussed a range of subjects, including the changing healthcare landscape around the world, biomedical R&D productivity, access to medicines, and clinical trials in emerging markets."
,,,The Pharma Futures II report is available on the website listed above.Improved Patient and Medical Group Transparency We continue to take significant steps to improve our transparency in how we partner with patient and medical organizations.
,,,Patient and medical groups carry out valuable work to improve the lives of people with a particular disease or medical condition.
,,,They often look to industry partners to provide financial support and other skills for their activities.
,,,This is one way we contribute to the improvement of patients’ lives beyond our core business of developing innovative medicines.
,,,"For example: In the United Kingdom www.pfizer.co.uk/template4.asp?pageid=392 In the UK we are required, as a member of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, to publish a list of the patient organizations we work with."
,,,"As part of our commitment to working with these groups in an open and transparent way, Pfizer UK has gone beyond the UK industry code and described the full nature of our relationships with these groups, as noted on our website above."
,,,"In the United States www.pfizermededgrants.com In the US, in 2008, we will develop a disclosure plan for educational grants and include stakeholders in our planning process, as noted on our website above."
,,,This will ensure stakeholders’ views are considered as the reporting process is developed.
,,,"Continuing medical education, sponsored by these grants, provides educational opportunities to physicians and other healthcare professionals that help them to improve patient care.overview Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report 13 Some social or environmental problems can only be solved by collective action, when stakeholders from an entire industry or a cross-section of society band together for the greater good—when “all hands on deck” can provide solutions most effectively."
,,,"We try to demonstrate our corporate responsibility by taking a leadership role in such collective actions, either within the biomedical community or in cross-sector initiatives."
,,,"We know that working with our colleagues from other companies and civil institutions results in more effective, long-term solutions."
,,,"Examples include:Working to Provide Coverage for the Uninsured www.coalitionfortheuninsured.or g With approximately 47 million Americans still lacking healthcare coverage, Pfizer joined a highly diverse group of 16 public-private partners to rethink the issue and lay out a path for progress."
,,,"Over the past two years, this coalition, the Health Coverage Coalition for the Uninsured (HCCU), comprised of healthcare providers, trade associations and activist groups, developed consensus recommendations for covering a significant number of the uninsured."
,,,"On January 18, 2007, the coalition released an agreement which all the parties endorsed, in what we think is a national healthcare first in the US."
,,,"For more information on the key principles and recommendations, please see page 89.Partnership for Quality Medical Donations www.pqmd.or g PQMD is dedicated to advancing the quality of medical products delivered to underserved people and disaster victims around the world."
,,,Pfizer sponsored two key PQMD projects.
,,,We funded a study to develop a methodology for estimating the number of patients treated based on the volumes of medicines shipped to developing countries by PQMD members.
,,,We also funded and directed the creation of an educational film that teaches the basics of medical inventory management and raises awareness of the supply chain management profession globally.

,,,"They are:Chantix® Pfizer’s smoking-cessation medicine, Chantix® works by reducing the severity of the smoker’s urge to smoke, while diminishing the sense of satisfaction if a patient smokes during treatment."
,,,"It’s offered with a personalized patient support program called GetQuit, to help smokers quit."
,,,"According to many public health, cardiovascular, pulmonary and cancer experts, helping smokers quit is one of the most important things a physician can do to improve patients’ overall health and reduce their risk of developing serious chronic conditions."
,,,"Exubera® The first inhalable form of insulin, Exubera® meets a critical medical need to manage Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in adults, by offering a highly effective alternative to pills and insulin injections."

,,,"For these treatment- experienced patients, Pfizer’s Selzentry TM (maraviroc), a novel compound in a new class of drugs, may offer help where currently available therapies have failed."
,,,"Discovered by Pfizer scientists in 1997, SelzentryTM is an oral medicine that blocks viral entry to human cells."
,,,"Rather than fighting HIV inside white blood cells, it prevents the virus from entering uninfected cells by blocking its predominant entry route, the CCR5 co-receptor."
,,,"In August 2007, the FDA approved Selzentry TM for use along with other antiretroviral agents for treatment-experienced patients infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1."
,,,It is the first member of a new class of oral HIV medicines in more than a decade.
,,,"We also received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, in Europe, and are submitting marketing applications around the world."
,,,"We are engaging key external stakeholders including bilateral and multilateral organizations (such as the World Health Organization and UNAIDS), nongovernmental organizations, regulatory bodies, HIV/AIDS advocates and people at risk and living with HIV/AIDS, and other key opinion leaders in the field, to determine how to best facilitate responsible access to Selzentry TM in developing world countries based on Selzentry’sTM current utility and approved indication."
,,,We plan to proactively communicate our access strategy for the developing world as this work nears completion.

,,,Clinical trials are crucial to discovering and developing new medicines.
,,,This section describes what clinical trials are and how they work.
,,,A clinical trial is a research study performed with human volunteers to answer specific health questions and to prove the relative safety and effectiveness of a potential medicine.
,,,Patients in clinical trials are carefully selected by healthcare professionals/physicians and closely monitored to ensure their safety and the integrity of the results.
,,,government agencies regulate all phases of clinical research up to the approval of a new drug.
,,,"Carefully conducted clinical trials are the safest way to find new or improved treatments, advance medical knowledge, and improve clinical practice in many areas of medicine.What are the different phases of clinical trials?"
,,,Clinical trials are divided into the following phases: Phase I trials are the first studies of a drug in human subjects.
,,,"Phase I trials test the safety and tolerability of a prospective medicine, helping to determine which dosages are safe and well tolerated."
,,,"The studies are typically in a small sample of study subjects, who are usually healthy volunteers, although for some types of drugs, Phase I trials may be conducted in patients who have the condition that the drug is intended to treat.1 Phase II trials usually involve patients with the disease that the new medicine is designed to treat."
,,,The emphasis in Phase II is determining the effectiveness of the medicine against the disease; the most effective dose (that produces minimal side effects); and the most appropriate method of delivering the new medicine.
,,,2 Phase III trials are typically large-scale studies which can involve thousands of patients.
,,,"Through large-scale testing, a research sponsor is able to develop a profile of the drug’s efficacy, advantages, and side effects."
,,,Phase III studies normally last several years and often involve comparison of the prospective new medicine with currently available therapies.
,,,3 Phase IV studies are conducted after a product is already approved for sale by a government regulatory body (FDA in the US).
,,,"Phase IV studies provide additional information about the medicine, often including information about long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use (see page 54 for further details).4 Ensuring Ethical Clinical Trials Pfizer and its various stakeholders continually look for ways to improve the clinical trial process—to better assess a product’s benefit/risk profile, strengthen protections for clinical trial participants, and expand public disclosure of clinical trial results in all phases."
,,,"For scientific, humanitarian and regulatory reasons, we perform these trials around the world uniformly and with necessary rigor, to ensure the highest research standards, while demonstrating utmost respect for the health, well-being and safety of research participants, and the culture, laws and regulations of countries where we conduct our studies."
,,,Our Clinical Trial Disclosure Policy is posted on www.pfizer.com/research/ registration_disclosure_authorship.jsp.r&D: finDing cUreS anD treatmentS 26 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility ReportMaintaining Clinical Trial Standards in the Developing World In recent years there has been an increase in clinical trials conducted in developing and emerging countries.
,,,"While we still conduct most of our trials in North America and Europe, others are done in advanced countries in Asia and Latin America."
,,,"Around 10 percent of study participants come from Eastern Europe and another 10 percent from Asia, excluding Japan."
,,,A very small percentage come from the Middle East and Africa.
,,,There are several reasons for this changing trend.
,,,"Some countries require local clinical trials before a medicine can be registered there, even if it has been approved by regulators elsewhere."
,,,"There are also specific medical reasons, like targeting certain diseases according to global incidence and prevalence."
,,,"We conduct clinical trials in accordance with local laws and regulations, and recognize international standards, like the International Conference of Harmonization, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) Guidelines (www.ich.org/LOB/media/ MEDIA482.pdf) and the Declaration of Helsinki."
,,,"We also have the responsibility to ensure that GCPs are followed by contract research organizations we hire.Trovan: Facing Challenges in the Developing World Addressing Stakeholders Pharmaceutical companies face unique challenges when conducting drug trials for potentially life-saving medicines in countries with weak, ambiguous or nonexistent medical and regulatory infrastructures."
,,,"In recent years, companies have been challenged legally and in the media regardless of their scientific success or failure, or the humanitarian nature of their efforts."
,,,Pfizer is currently facing such a legal issue.
,,,"The case concerns a clinical trial of Pfizer’s antibiotic, Trovan, and children suffering from meningitis during a severe meningitis epidemic in Kano, Nigeria in 1996."
,,,"Eleven years later, in June 2007, Kano and federal authorities filed civil and criminal lawsuits in Nigeria against Pfizer."
,,,One of the allegations is that Pfizer failed to obtain proper informed consent from the children’s families.
,,,"As Pfizer stated in its response to this action, Pfizer acted in the best interest of the children and used the best medical knowledge available to treat patients."
,,,"Before any child was admitted to the study, the entire process for conducting the trial was explained to each parent or guardian in their native language, and consent was obtained orally."
,,,The parents or guardians were allowed to remain with and see their children during the treatment.
,,,The study was conducted with the necessary approvals from the relevant government agencies and in a responsible and ethical way consistent with the company’s commitment to patient safety.
,,,Trovan proved safe and effective.
,,,The study’s survival rate for both Trovan and the comparative drug exceeded the survival rate of any other treatment being administered at the Infectious Disease Hospital in Kano.
,,,Addressing the Epidemic Nigeria’s 1996 meningitis outbreak was the most serious meningitis epidemic ever recorded in the country.
,,,"It took the lives of almost 12,000 people over six months, and significantly strained the country’s health system."
,,,Pfizer’s goal was to bring a life-saving and innovative form of antibiotic that could be used effectively in a meningitis epidemic.
,,,"Trovan was not only demonstrated in pre-clinical studies to be effective at treating the meningitis pathogen, its oral form avoided the use of intravenous administration or intramuscular injections."
,,,"At the time of the study, Trovan was in late-stage development and had been tested clinically in more than 5,000 patients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere."
,,,Pfizer was getting ready to begin a global pediatric meningitis clinical study when the 1996 epidemic broke out.
,,,This pediatric meningitis study was eventually conducted in 1998 and the study concluded that Trovan raised no new safety concerns.
,,,Increasing Clinical Trial Transparency Ethical standards for clinical research are evolving and stakeholders have a growing interest in greater transparency.
,,,"With the expansion of our clinical trials disclosure policy in January 2007, we now register every Pfizer-sponsored clinical study in patients on the NIH-sponsored website www.clinicaltrials.gov ."
,,,This includes Phase 1 trials and non-interventional studies with prospective data.
,,,"For every trial Pfizer registers, we also disclose the results in the PhRMA results database (www.clinicalstudyresults.or g), including data for products that receive regulatory approval."
,,,"As of August 8, 2007, Pfizer registered 842 studies on the NIH site and posted 554 studies on the PhRMA results site."
,,,"This expanded policy builds on our previous clinical trials disclosure commitment, which was based on the January 2005 Joint Statement of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA)."
,,,"For more information, please see www.pfizer.com/ research/clinical_trials.jsp.27 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report r&D: finDing cUreS anD treatmentSFor 15 years, our scientists had been working on a compound to dramatically improve the treatment of cardiovascular disease."
,,,"The compound, torcetrapib, aimed to raise “good” cholesterol, and the research looked very promising."
,,,"Then, in December 2006, to the surprise of many, we immediately terminated all clinical trials for torcetrapib."
,,,"With our focus on patient safety, we knew we had to stop the trial when the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an independent body overseeing the drug’s morbidity and mortality study, alerted us about a statistical imbalance in mortality all-cause and cardiovascular events among trial participants."
,,,The data was both surprising and disappointing.
,,,We had great hopes for the treatment and had already spent more than $1 billion dollars developing this medicine.
,,,Developing torcetrapib required innovation across all areas of Pfizer—from biology and chemistry to manufacturing.
,,,"When we decided to terminate the trial, our medical team immediately reached out to hundreds of clinical trial investigators to notify them of the decision, and we contacted other key audiences, including regulatory agencies around the world."
,,,"We also were open and accessible in communicating with the media and financial communities, as well as with our employees."
,,,The one silver lining in all of this was the overall public reaction to our news.
,,,"While our stock lost approximately 10 percent of its value by the end of that first day, we received praise for our swift response from some of our harshest media critics."
,,,"As one newspaper described it, the way we handled the crisis helped to “restore our faith in the integrity of corporations that play such a big role in safeguarding our health and safety.” The stock price later recovered."
,,,The torcetrapib story is a reminder of the profound risks associated with biomedical R&D.
,,,"The fact is, 75 percent of all biomedical research ends in failure, so the average cost to discover and develop one approved medicine has increased to more than $800 million, according to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development."
,,,"As Pfizer’s head of global R&D said, “We do science to help cure the world’s diseases, and when it works, it’s fantastic."
,,,"But no project advances without a hitch and nothing we do is truly unsuccessful…this is one of the most important projects we’ve ever worked on and we will learn from this.”Torcetrapib: A Case Study in Responsible Actions QUICK DECISION MAKING TRANSPARENCY COST OF R&D STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTR&D: finDing cuRes anD tReatments 28 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report When people think of human embryonic stem cells, they don’t often imagine the power of these cells in drug discovery."
,,,"For more than a decade, Pfizer has been using animal or adult stem cells in its laboratories to help screen new compounds and identify safer and more effective medicines."
,,,"With compelling evidence from this research, Pfizer has begun to explore accessing drug development technology from leading academic, biotechnology or pharmaceutical partners around the world, who also have experience with currently-available, human embryonic stem cell lines that meet the highest ethical standards set by leading scientific authorities."
,,,This Pfizer Stem Cell Policy guides the company’s research activities and its exploration of new external partnerships.
,,,The policy summary follows: • Pfizer recognizes the enormous potential of stem cell research.
,,,"Stem cells are important tools for modern biomedical research, including Pfizer’s search for innovative new medicines."
,,,• Pfizer has made significant investments in animal stem cells and in human adult hematopoietic (somatic) stem cells.
,,,The company will continue to invest in these stem cell technologies.
,,,"• Pfizer recognizes that human embryonic stem cells may provide even greater potential due to their increased ability for self-renewal and capacity to form a wide variety of cells and tissues.Pfizer’s stem cell Research Policy • Pfizer acknowledges the sensitive issues raised by this research, and we support proper ethical safeguards that take into account both the moral issues and public sensitivities."
,,,"• Pfizer will only engage in stem cell research projects that meet the highest ethical standards set by leading scientific authorities around the world, including the Guidelines developed by the National Academy of Sciences in the USA."
,,,• Pfizer strongly opposes any efforts to clone human beings.
,,,A human stem cell culture.r&D: finDing cUreS anD treatmentS Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report 29 Pursuing a Humane Approach to Animals in research we understand our stakeholders’ concerns about the use of animals in research testing.
,,,"Based on our Animal w elfare policy, we proactively look for alternatives that reduce, replace or refine our work with animals."
,,,"in order to adopt new nonanimal test methods, we engage in and lead cross-industry efforts aimed at developing new testing and information systems that may help accurately predict medical outcomes and reduce the use of animals in testing."
,,,"Currently and for the foreseeable future, it is only through the combination of animal-based research and alternatives that we can understand the fundamental biology of the diseases we are trying to treat, discover new medicines and assess their safety."
,,,"While new technologies can reduce our use of animals, most are applicable only for safety evaluations, which are the smaller portion of our animal use."
,,,The majority of the animals utilized in testing are used to understand basic causes of disease and to test the efficacy of new candidate compounds for medicines.
,,,A range of studies measure how a new medicine is absorbed and how the body distributes and breaks it down.
,,,"Exploratory studies of this kind can be done in tissues, but the pivotal studies have to be done in whole animals before we can conduct them in humans."
,,,"We work through pharmaceutical trade organizations and relevant scientific boards, and directly with global regulatory authorities, to increase the common understanding and acceptance of appropriate alternative methods."
,,,One example of this is our strategic investment in the work of the International Life Sciences Institutes/Health and Environmental Sciences Institute.
,,,We are also members of the In Vitro Testing Industrial Platform (IVTIP).
,,,Pfizer cannot eliminate our use of animals in research at this time.
,,,"But we can make sure that the tests we need to carry out—some of which are required for regulatory purposes and others because it’s the only way to get the necessary medical answers—are done to the very highest ethical standards of animal welfare.Improving Animal Health Pfizer Animal Health (PAH) is dedicated to improving the safety, quality and productivity of the food supply and helping pets live longer, healthier lives through innovation in products for livestock and companion animals."
,,,"In 2006, PAH spent $270 million on research to improve the health and welfare of animals."
,,,"One recent Pfizer launch, Improvac—a novel alternative to surgical castration of boars—is a good example."
,,,The animal welfare community is applauding this product for its humane approach to a necessary animal husbandry practice.
,,,"To advance canine cancer research, PAH announced that it will donate $1.1 million over two years to help establish a national canine tumor tissue bank."
,,,"The Pfizer Canine Tumor Biospecimen Bank will be housed at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda, Maryland, and will be managed by the Morris Animal Foundation (MAF)—the world’s largest charitable nonprofit organization funding research to protect, treat and cure animals worldwide."
,,,"With this tissue bank, veterinary and medical investigators can explore the mechanisms of cancer, evaluate promising new drug candidates and possibly develop a better understanding of the relationship between human and animal cancers."
,,,"Animal Welfare Policy For as long as it’s necessary to use animals in the discovery, development and evaluation of new medicines, we are committed to humane treatment."
,,,Parties conducting animal-based research on behalf of Pfizer must adhere to our standards.
,,,We embrace the three principles known as the 3Rs of animal research first proposed in 1959 by Russell and Burch.
,,,"Replacement of animal experiments with non-animal experiments, such as mathematical models, computer simulations, and in vitro biological systems wherever appropriate; and where animals must be used: Reduction of the numbers of animals used in each study, and of the number of studies involving animals, to the absolute minimum necessary to obtain valid results and achieve our research objectives; and Refinement of procedures involving animals to minimize the potential for pain and distress."

,,,"effective partnerships not only help us achieve scientific advances, but they also help us streamline the complex and expensive r&d process."
,,,"Pfizer’s alliance portfolio is large but focused, involving partners with expertise that spans the entire process of discovering, developing and delivering new medicines for patients in need."
,,,"Collaborating with The Scripps Research Institute In December 2006, we announced a five-year research collaboration with The Scripps Research Institute."
,,,"Scientists from Pfizer and Scripps will work together to study and evaluate possible therapeutic approaches for such uncured diseases as cancer, diabetes and mental illness."
,,,"The collaboration will involve the development of new tests to rapidly validate approaches as possible novel treatment options.The FDA’s “Critical Path” Initiative In 2004 the US FDA launched Critical Path, a cooperative initiative aimed at improving the scientific and regulatory processes that can turn new science into better medical treatments."
,,,"Since its inception, Pfizer has been an active supporter of this initiative."
,,,"In 2005, with extensive input from public and private stakeholders including Pfizer, the FDA published a Critical Path Opportunities List, highlighting such areas as the qualification of better evaluation tools and the development of streamlined clinical trial methods."
,,,The initiative has stimulated the formation of public-private partnerships such as The Biomarkers Consortium.
,,,"The Biomarkers Consortium In October 2006, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), the FDA, the NIH, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), with active participation from Pfizer, launched The Biomarkers Consortium, a public-private research partnership."
,,,"The Biomarkers Consortium sponsors projects to discover, develop and qualify new biological markers—molecular or biological indicators that help identify risk for disease, make a diagnosis or assess drug safety—to support new drug development, preventive medicine and medical diagnostics."
,,,Results from Consortium projects will be broadly available to researchers worldwide.

,,,Strengthening P atient S afety 55 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report Pfizer’s Post-Marketing Transparency we understand concerns from some stakeholders about the need for more transparency and information on the safety of medicines once they reach the marketplace.
,,,"To address this, we took an important step in leading public accountability—the launch in May 2007 of our online post-marketing transparency initiative."
,,,"Through this initiative, we created a website to provide up-to-date, user-friendly information on the status of our US post-marketing commitments."
,,,"Post-marketing commitments (PMCs) are studies conducted after a medicine receives regulatory approval, often as a requirement for approval or continued marketing of some medicines."
,,,"The studies are designed to provide additional information about the medicine’s safety, efficacy or optimal use."
,,,This initiative is the first of its kind for a pharmaceutical company.
,,,"The website provides study descriptions and status of US FDA post-marketing commitments, current due dates, total listed Pfizer PMCs, and general information about the PMC process."
,,,It is available at www.pfizer.com/pmc.
,,,"“From a medical compound’s discovery, through its development, and for as long as it is prescribed, each of our medicines undergoes thorough safety and efficacy monitoring and evaluation in collaboration with health authorities around the world,” said Pfizer’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Joseph Feczko."
,,,“This kind of transparency helps encourage patients to ask their physicians about treatment options.
,,,"When these conversations happen, they often help patients better understand the risks and benefits of different treatment options.” The FDA first posted a database of all the industry’s post- marketing commitments on its public website in 2003."
,,,"The new Pfizer site expands the information available, presented with easy search functions, a glossary of terms, and frequently asked questions about PMCs."
,,,"Users can view our regulatory commitments for prescription medications by product name, approval date and study status, among other criteria."
,,,We will update the site weekly.“ This kind of transparency helps encourage patients to ask their physicians about treatment options.

,,,"In addition, Pfizer has provided 40 training programs for enforcement and regulatory authorities in 17 countries."
,,,"Our partnerships with those agencies have contributed to the dismantling of counterfeiting operations in more than 20 countries, including Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, India, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.Pharmaceutical counterfeiting is on the rise around the globe, potentially putting at risk millions of patients who take for granted that the prescription medicines they buy are safe and effective."
,,,Counterfeit drugs are dangerous by their very nature—they are not produced under safe manufacturing practices and they are not inspected by the regulatory authorities.
,,,Many are produced by criminals with sophisticated equipment capable of duplicating near-perfect copies of the medicines and their packaging.
,,,"Because counterfeiters are frequently more concerned with the appearance than the efficacy of their counterfeits, it is impossible for patients to know what ingredients these fake medicines actually contain."
,,,"Some may contain none of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, depriving patients of the therapeutic benefit they expected from the product."
,,,"Others may contain lethal ingredients, including heavy metal, arsenic, boric acid, leaded paint and floor polish."
,,,"To address this issue, Pfizer launched a focused anti- counterfeiting program in 1998 to detect and disrupt major counterfeiting operations, in response to the detection of counterfeit Viagra ®."
,,,"Since then, counterfeit Pfizer medicines have been found in at least 73 countries, with more than 25 million counterfeit tablets seized by authorities in the past three years alone."
,,,"In response to this growing problem, the staff devoted to combating counterfeiting has increased to 17 full-time colleagues, most of whom have prior law enforcement experience."
,,,"We have partnered with law enforcement around the world, developing leads, providing those leads to law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and then assisting in those investigations as requested."

,,,"In high-risk markets, such as the UK, we have changed the way our medicines are distributed, opting to move away from the less-secure wholesaling model to supply directly to pharmacies."
,,,"On many of our products, we have introduced color-shifting ink logos and tamper-evident packaging as authentication tools for pharmacists, doctors and patients."
,,,"Using Radio Frequency ID to Combat Counterfeiting In our latest initiative to combat pharmaceutical counterfeiting, we have begun a pilot program to ship a medicine containing radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to customers in the United States."
,,,"RFID technology is being added to all Viagra ® tablets sold in the US so pharmacies and wholesalers can verify the unique electronic product code, or EPC, on Viagra® packaging."
,,,"We are the first pharmaceutical company to put in place a program of this type, focused on EPC authentication as a means of deterring counterfeiting."
,,,"Pfizer has invested several million dollars to date in the technology, which discourages counterfeiting because it is both difficult and expensive to duplicate."
,,,Pharmacists and wholesalers use specially-designed electronic scanners that communicate the code over the Internet to a secure Pfizer website.
,,,The company’s application of RFID is not yet capable of “tracking and tracing” medicines through the distribution system.
,,,“Track and trace” requires that all parts of the supply chain invest in compatible technology and agree to capture and share information about product movement.
,,,Pfizer will continue to explore the uses of this technology—including “track and trace” in 2007 and beyond.
,,,Pfizer’s application of RFID does not allow for the collection of any patient information.
,,,"We are also working cooperatively with standards-setting bodies, state governments, the FDA, industry groups and customers to establish policies for the widespread application of RFID in the future."
,,,How do you know if you’ve purchased a counterfeit medicine?
,,,"In some cases, patients later identified counterfeits as having a different taste, odor, consistency or appearance."
,,,Patients may also have a different reaction to the counterfeit drug.Strengthening P atient S afety 58 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Reportimproving Safety in the drug distribution Chain every year Americans fill more than three billion prescriptions through reputable pharmacies.
,,,The vast majority of these medicines are distributed through top-quality wholesalers.
,,,"But in the last few years, counterfeit drugs have entered the nation’s supply chain."
,,,This problem is exacerbated by the split jurisdiction of drug safety.
,,,"While the US FDA oversees the approval and manufacture of drugs, each of the 50 states is in charge of licensing and inspecting the wholesalers who distribute and dispense them."
,,,And now the Internet complicates matters even more.
,,,"To help prevent counterfeit medicines from entering the pharmaceutical distribution system, Pfizer has helped shape model legislation that imposes criminal background checks and criminal penalties for counterfeiting."
,,,"It also establishes licensing requirements for secondary wholesalers, and requires “change of ownership” documentation if medicines leave the traditional distribution chain."
,,,"Working with law enforcement agencies and many other stakeholders since 2004, anti-counterfeiting legislation has passed in 25 states, with the remaining 25 states either considering or introducing similar laws."
,,,"Stakeholders working with Pfizer on this legislation include the Healthcare Distribution Management Association (HDMA), the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) and the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP)."
,,,"One change spurred by the legislation is a significant reduction in the number of transactions (the number of times a medicine changes hands) in the distribution process, from 15 to 20 transactions to three or four."
,,,"And when a medicine leaves the normal distribution chain, it would require a “pedigree”—a document or electronic file that would include defined data elements that established the medicine’s change of ownership."
,,,"By 2010, Pfizer expects to implement “e-pedigrees” for all our medicines, and those most susceptible to counterfeiting may also carry a unique serial number.aWarDs an D reCogni Tion Pfizer received, in 2007, an International Association of Business Communicator’s Gold Quill Award for communication materials developed for the Coalition Against Fake Medicines."

,,,"However, our awareness of this issue has increased with the development of new analytical technologies that detect minute traces of pharmaceuticals and other organic chemicals in the environment."
,,,Patient use of prescription and over-the-counter medications is the most significant pathway by which trace amounts of pharmaceuticals enter the environment.
,,,"Because people excrete medicines that are not fully metabolized or absorbed by the body, and because sewage treatment plants are generally not equipped to remove these constituents, trace amounts of medicines are present in rivers, streams and other surface waters."
,,,"A small quantity of pharmaceuticals may be introduced into the environment when patients dispose of unused prescription and OTC medications in landfills and sewage systems, but disposal is not believed to be a major pathway."
,,,"Several studies to date indicate that the presence of trace concentrations of pharmaceuticals in surface water and drinking water present no appreciable risk to human health, but scientific knowledge on the cumulative or long-term impact of these trace levels on both human health and aquatic ecosystems is in the earliest stages of development."
,,,"Because Pfizer is committed to adhering to principles of responsible environmental stewardship, we are working in close cooperation with the scientific community, regulatory agencies, patient groups and NGOs to develop and advance the body of knowledge related to pharmaceuticals in the environment and their potential impacts."
,,,"For instance, Pfizer was an active participant in the pharmaceutical industry’s development of the PhATE model, a scientific tool that can be used to more realistically estimate the concentration and distribution of active pharmaceutical ingredients discharged into US surface waters."
,,,Pfizer also participates in product take-back programs in countries that have initiated them.
,,,We are committed to minimizing the disposal of pharmaceuticals from patients and to investigating unused medicine disposal alternatives.Realizing the Promise of Green Chemistry Pfizer has been at the forefront of developing and manufacturing drugs using environmentally-friendly Green Chemistry (GC) practices.
,,,"By applying GC principles, Pfizer has improved the way it produces many products, substantially reducing waste, saving money, and winning recognition for its environmental efforts."
,,,"For example, Lyrica ®, which treats neuropathic pain associated with diabetes or shingles, is being manufactured using a third-generation synthesis of the product that eliminates five million gallons of waste per year."
,,,"Similarly, a green chemistry modification for the manufacture of Vfend ®, an antifungal medication, 15 years in the making, led to a reduction of 25,000 tons of waste per year."
,,,"In order to share knowledge within our organization, colleagues meet monthly to produce common education materials for chemists and engineers."
,,,The first of these materials—a guide in the selection of environmentally-friendly solvents—has been rolled out to chemists throughout Pfizer’s R&D organization and is subsequently used by chemists and engineers in the manufacturing organization.
,,,"Similarly, a reagents guide has been developed and is expected to be distributed over the next few months."
,,,"Pfizer teams also actively collaborate to promote the principles of Green Chemistry through a number of community outreach activities, including workshops, conferences and curricula for middle school, high school and universities."
,,,"Recognized as a Green Chemistry Leader In 2002, Pfizer received the US Environmental Protection Agency Presidential Green Chemistry Award for applying Green Chemistry to the manufacturing of Zoloft®."

,,,"From 2003 to 2006, we reduced our lost time injury and illness rate by 21 percent."
,,,"However, from 2005 to 2006 there was an approximate decrease of only 5 percent."
,,,We recognize our LTIR is above the 2006 pharmaceutical industry average of 0.47.
,,,"We continue to evaluate the reasons behind the rate and in parallel, have implemented several programs in 2007 to advance our safety culture."
,,,"Another one of our key metrics to help determine the adequacy of our safety programs is the Total Injury Rate (TIR), commonly referred to as the OSHA recordable rate."
,,,It is expressed as the number of recordable injuries that occur per 100 employees per year.
,,,"We track this information in addition to the LTIR because it captures more information on injuries, enabling us to better identify and focus on areas in need of improvement."
,,,"Pfizer successfully reduced its TIR by 43 percent from 2003 to 2006, and 20 percent from 2005 to 2006, although we still remain above the 2006 pharmaceutical industry average of 1.04."

,,,"To address these risks and ensure the safety of our communities, colleagues and others, Pfizer has a mature and sophisticated process safety program designed to maintain safe and environmentally sound operations worldwide."
,,,"This means taking the necessary steps to prevent the risk of an accidental chemical release, fire, explosion or any other unexpected process upset."
,,,"In addition to full compliance with all laws and regulations, we use the EHS Guideline on Process Safety to make sure R&D and manufacturing facilities worldwide implement programs to protect our colleagues and communities from the threat of an accident."

,,,Adopted a new international procedure to improve our implementation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery laws.The Impact of Culture and Values Improvements in corporate governance alone will not generate trust or restore investor confidence.
,,,Good corporate governance must be rooted in the culture and values of the organization and the way we do business every day.
,,,"Our colleagues understand that these values apply to everyone, everywhere around the globe."
,,,Our ability to be viewed as a trusted member of society begins with the Pfizer Policies on Business Conduct.
,,,"In addition, Pfizer Directors are required to comply with a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics designed specifically to cover all areas of professional conduct relating to service on our Board."
,,,"These policies and code, as well as others mentioned in this section, can be found at www.pfizer.com/corpgov .Over the last few years, the business community has been revamping its corporate governance procedures in response to shareholder demands for increased transparency."
,,,In 1992 we became the first major company to form a department devoted exclusively to corporate governance.
,,,We have worked steadily to build a solid foundation of leadership in Board effectiveness and accountability to shareholders and all stakeholders.
,,,"This year, we took new actions to build on that legacy.76 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility ReportInstituting Greater Accountability in Executive Compensation Executive compensation was a key issue for shareholders and other stakeholders and it underwent comprehensive changes in 2006 during a time of CEO transition."
,,,The Board elected Jeff Kindler to the position of Chief Executive Officer in July 2006 and structured a compensation plan that provides a tight link between his future pay and near- and long-term value creation for Pfizer shareholders.
,,,A significant portion of his total compensation is tied directly to Pfizer’s shareholder returns.
,,,"He does not have an employment contract, and his retirement benefits are based on the same formula as other salaried Pfizer employees."
,,,"In addition to strengthening the link among the CEO’s annual incentive pay, financial performance and shareholder value, the Board refocused 2006 performance-share grants so that rewards are determined solely on the basis of relative total shareholder return, as compared to other major pharmaceutical companies."
,,,"Pfizer is also now using a higher-performing pharmaceutical peer group, as well as a Fortune 100 peer group, to compare competitive compensation and performance criteria.Ensuring Board Independence The Board is comprised of a majority of independent directors, and has elected a nonmanagement director to serve in a lead capacity."
,,,"The current Lead Independent Director, Constance J. Horner, presides at executive sessions, functions as principal liaison on Board-wide issues between the independent directors and the Chairman, assures an appropriate agenda and flow of information to the Board, and recommends the retention of outside advisors and consultants who report directly to the Board."
,,,"If requested by shareholders, the Lead Independent Director will be available, as appropriate, for consultation and direct communication."
,,,"The Board of Directors adopted a formal set of Director Qualification Standards, which outline guidelines for director independence that either meet or exceed the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange."
,,,Strict guidelines for Directors and their immediate families must be followed with respect to past employment or affiliation with Pfizer or its independent registered public accounting firm.
,,,"All of our Directors are independent, with the exception of our Chairman, Jeff Kindler and our Chairman Emeritus, William C. Steere, Jr."
,,,"The Board follows a defined set of Corporate Governance Principles and conducts an annual evaluation to assure that the guidelines are timely, effective, and best represent the Board’s oversight and accountability on behalf of shareholders."
,,,"Each Board committee has a charter outlining its responsibilities, and a checklist of oversight responsibilities to be covered throughout the year."
,,,"As part of the annual nomination process for directors, the Corporate Governance Committee reviews the qualifications of each director, evaluating skills and talents to assure a balance of expertise in various disciplines and perspectives."
,,,"Encouraging Shareholder and Stakeholder Participation Pfizer’s Corporate Governance Committee Charter requires directors to “maintain an informed status on Company issues related to corporate social responsibility and the Company’s participation and visibility as a global corporate citizen.” To assure effective communication, Pfizer was among the first companies to expand communication via the Internet, so shareholders and all stakeholders can contact members of the Board directly."
,,,"Relevant communications are distributed to the Board or individual directors, and the Board receives a quarterly summary of all shareholder and stakeholder communications."
,,,"This practice serves as an early warning system, so the Board can identify and respond to shareholder and stakeholder concerns.Meeting Face-to-Face Pfizer is the first company to initiate a regular meeting between its Board and institutional investors on governance."
,,,The Board will invite representatives who evaluate governance practices and who vote the proxies of the company’s largest institutional investors.
,,,These representatives will have an opportunity to provide comments and perspective on Pfizer’s governance policies and practices including executive compensation.
,,,They own in aggregate approximately 35 percent of Pfizer’s shares.
,,,The initial meeting is planned for the fall of 2007.
,,,Pfizer has been in the forefront of corporate governance for over two decades.
,,,"It has taken the lead in the elimination of its poison pill; the declassification of the Board, so that all directors are elected at each annual meeting; the adoption of majority voting policy; and expanded disclosures on executive compensation well ahead of new SEC regulations."
,,,The company was also among the first to use SEC “Plain English” rules to make disclosures more understandable to investors.

,,,"Advancing Colleague Understanding: Pfizer Compliance Education Center The legal environment is becoming more complicated with each passing year, so we addressed the need for additional colleague education by creating the Pfizer Compliance Education Center."
,,,"The Center offers a series of interactive programs, delivered through the web and other available means, which are customized to meet individual needs in the areas of greater risk."
,,,"For example, sales representatives throughout the United States receive annual training in the various healthcare laws and Pfizer policies which affect their interactions with healthcare professionals."
,,,"These programs cover topics of corporate compliance, as well as ethical and legal responsibility, primarily complementing the many programs already in place within the organization."
,,,"The goal is to give colleagues access to compliance information at all times and to make sure, to the extent possible, that they are appropriately grounded in the key compliance issues that affect service to patients and customers Every year we ask Pfizer colleagues, including the company’s senior leadership, to take the Pfizer Integrity Pledge and certify that they understand and are abiding by the standards described in the “Blue Book”."
,,,"Online guidance and 24-hour support are available to any colleagues with questions or concerns in their area of the business.Preventing Bribery and Corruption The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which became US law in 1977, contains three key provisions that pertain to our business: • An anti-bribery provision, which makes it unlawful to bribe foreign government officials directly or indirectly to obtain or retain business • The books and records provision, which imposes requirements on public companies to maintain accurate books and records, and to implement stringent accounting and financial controls and • The system of internal controls provision, which imposes requirements on public companies to implement stringent accounting and financial controls."
,,,"To continually improve on our ability to adhere to all provisions of the FCPA, we implemented, in April 2007, the International Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Corporate Procedure."
,,,"This procedure establishes anti-bribery standards and processes designed to support compliance with the FCPA, as well as local anti-bribery laws."
,,,Pfizer also developed an implementation platform to help local teams train colleagues and adopt local procedures.
,,,"This platform is divided into 12 separate sections, which covers such things as third-party transactions and consultancy agreements to gifts, hospitality, international meeting support and site visits, to educational grants, investigator-initiated research grants, charitable contributions and political contributions."
,,,"To support compliance even further, the company has also established the following tools and systems: • A compliance hotline in 70 countries • Global compliance liaisons in all markets • Training for all colleagues, with materials available in 45 languages • Auditing procedures for all sales and marketing programs."
,,,Evaluating Corporate Regulatory Compliance To maintain and enhance the value of our internal audit activities—and to make sure the company is able to identify and evaluate any potential gaps in the overall status of Pfizer’s compliance systems—the Legal Division brought four Regulatory Compliance Audit functions together under a single umbrella and redesigned the audit process.

,,,"The policy, written in 45 languages, provides specific guidelines on appropriate behavior for Pfizer colleagues who have direct contact with physicians and other healthcare professionals."
,,,"It covers such topics as the guidelines for Pfizer-hosted educational or promotional meetings, medical communications, marketing activities, confidentiality of patient data, and use of giveaway items."
,,,"Sales professionals, in particular, are required to complete and pass a self-study course on the policy."
,,,"In Sales, the policy was rolled out through a process coordinated by the Sales Leadership and Compliance Senior Sales Management which was responsible for completion of the training and monitoring."
,,,"Restructuring the Sales Force In 2006, we reduced the size of our sales force in the US by 20 percent, and management by up to 30 percent, with similar cuts in Europe and other parts of the world."
,,,"The restructuring was undertaken to better align Pfizer with physician needs and other changes in the marketplace—changing products and services, and changing stakeholder expectations—to become a better partner with healthcare professionals."
,,,"The sales force was reorganized into four operating units focused on products, with a fifth focused on customers."
,,,"The sales force became more entrepreneurial, increased its speed of decision-making in the field, and coordinated better with the Pfizer leadership team."
,,,"As a result, physicians said they felt they had been heard and that their patients could be better served."
,,,"In addition, we improved our internal efficiencies.We believe that responsible consumer advertising educates patients and is a critical conversation starter that results in life-changing diagnosis and treatment decisions."
,,,Data supports that consumers value the information provided by advertising that alerts them about potential health conditions and available treatment options.
,,,"Not all advertising is relevant to all people, but it is of critical interest to those who suffer or are at risk for an advertised condition."
,,,"Importantly, advertising motivates patients to seek additional information and to talk to their doctors, and it is only through consultation with a physician that a treatment can be evaluated and prescribed."
,,,We recognize that this type of communication reaches a broad audience and thus requires a responsible approach.
,,,"To continuously improve the usefulness of this form of communication, we embarked on a series of changes over the past two years to make sure our prescription medicine advertising encourages patients to have appropriate conversations with their doctors, helps consumers understand the risks and benefits of prescription medicines, and motivates people to overcome significant barriers to better health.uniTeD sT aTes Delivering Beneficial Prescription Medicine Advertising Implementing New Prescription Medicine Consumer Advertising Guidelines In 2006 we committed to change some of our consumer advertising practices in the US by: • Educating physicians about our new medicines for a minimum of at least six months prior to beginning consumer television and print advertising • Submitting all new television ads to the FDA for comment in advance of airing • Increasing advertising efforts behind disease awareness and Pfizer Helpful Answers to provide more information on access to medicine (see pages 39, 48)."
,,,"In 2007 we made the following changes: • Lipitor ® advertising now reinforces the role of alternative treatments for high cholesterol, such as exercise and diet, and advises patients that physicians may recommend other treatment options • Print campaigns for Lyrica®, Lipitor®, Zyrtec® and others include easy-to-read facts about risks, and all print ads include Pfizer Helpful Answers information • Our advertising now promotes disease awareness, including awareness of heart health, overactive bladder and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) • Our newest Celebrex® commercial, previewed by the FDA, provides a broad context of the risk-benefit profiles of various prescription pain medications."
,,,"europe Aligning Customer Excellence The ACE (Aligning Customer Excellence) Program in Europe, is a Pfizer initiative designed to align Pfizer Europe to stakeholder needs and interests in the European healthcare marketplace."
,,,"It is based on a simple premise: it is no longer sufficient to discover, develop and deliver great medicines."
,,,"We must also help to improve standards of care, support knowledgeable consumerism, rebuild physician autonomy to facilitate better health outcomes, focus pricing and access on transparency and quality, and protect patient rights, among other endeavors."
,,,"In practice, this means: • Moving from treating people when they're sick to helping keep people well • Re-empowering physicians and patients so costs are not the only factor in determining health decisions • Working with stakeholders to find efficient and effective ways to spend scarce resources more wisely • Validating the value of innovative medicines to society by changing the focus from the cost of medicine to reducing the burden of disease."

,,,com/responsibility/lobbying_and_political_contributions.js p. PUblic POlicy88 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Reportsupporting Health reform Pfizer is part of a larger healthcare system in the US.
,,,"We are working along with other companies to help make policy reforms that strengthen the current system, improve quality and stabilize escalating healthcare costs."
,,,"Here are some primary examples: FDA Revitalization Act (FDARA) This legislation is an expansion of the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), a law requiring the industry to pay fees to the FDA in return for predictable regulatory review times and processes."
,,,"With this special funding, the FDA has been able to double its review staff and bring median review times for new drug applications down by about half—to allow for a 10-month review cycle (six months for priority applications)."
,,,"User fees were first established in 1992, then re-enacted every five years."
,,,User fees make up 42.5 percent of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research budget—with Congress appropriating $298 million and the FDA collecting $220 million from industry.
,,,"The user fee system has been criticized for two reasons: the potential or perceived impact of user fees on the FDA’s impartiality, and the fact that the fees are earmarked for new drug application reviews rather than for general activities or post-marketing safety work."
,,,"FDARA, however, also includes provisions for drug safety legislation and pediatrics, specifically the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Improvement Act."
,,,"Based on recent negotiations with the pharmaceutical industry, Congress will increase user fees for new drug applications, to keep drug review targets at 10 months."
,,,"The FDA can use a substantial part of the fees for post-marketing drug safety and pharmacovigilance efforts, as well as research on new drug safety tools."
,,,This is the most comprehensive reform of the FDA in the past decade and Pfizer is actively supportive of this important legislation.
,,,"Medicare In December 2003, the US Congress passed, and President George W. Bush signed into law, the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) which, for the first time, provided prescription drug coverage for American seniors and people with disabilities, called Medicare Part D. Pfizer applauds the Federal government for recognizing that a healthier society is achievable by addressing disease and sickness prevention."
,,,Medicare Part D is a significant step towards ensuring that the country’s senior and disabled patient populations have affordable access to the medicines they need to live longer healthy rather than live longer sick.
,,,"Without medicine, they pay more for hospitalizations and end-stage disease treatment."
,,,"There is considerable evidence that the program is working even better than initially expected, by giving Medicare recipients access to innovative medications at reasonable prices."
,,,"Recent estimates show that beneficiaries will save an average of $1,200 a year, while millions of low-income and seriously ill patients will each save thousands more."
,,,One of the reasons for this success is competition.
,,,"The different plans offered by different insurance companies compete on premiums and on access to the best, most-commonly-used medicines."
,,,"With this successful implementation, Pfizer continues to support the roll-out of the Part D benefit."
,,,Over 90 percent of America’s senior citizens and younger people with disabilities now have prescription drug coverage due to the new Medicare prescription drug program.
,,,We partner with both government and community groups to provide education and assistance and help improve access to medicines for seniors.
,,,"Drug Importation Prescription drug importation occurs when foreign pharmacies and traders ship medicines, which may or may not be approved for use in other countries, into the US for sale to American consumers."
,,,"Over the past several years, there have been a number of legislative proposals to amend current health and safety laws so distributors can import prescription medicines from other countries into the US, or allow individuals to purchase medications directly from pharmacies in other countries."
,,,"Although importation may sound appealing, it presents real risks to patients and there is no guarantee that the imported pharmaceuticals would be safe."
,,,"Federal law on prescription drug imports reflects well-documented concerns about the safety of imported medicines, and the risk that many of these drugs will be unapproved, adulterated, contaminated, or counterfeit (see page 56 for more on counterfeit medicines)."
,,,"Many drugs that consumers believe are coming from Canadian pharmacies actually come from other countries, where the supply chain may not be secure."
,,,"If the US government were to allow large-scale, systematic importation, several federal agencies believe that safety problems would only get worse."
,,,"Importation not only creates safety risks, it does so without any guarantee of meaningful off-setting cost savings."
,,,It also threatens innovation and the future development of new medicines.
,,,"Because foreign governments mandate discounted drug prices, the US market bears more of the costs of biomedical research."
,,,"If markets are unwilling to pay for innovation, the flow of new, innovative medicines will be affected."
,,,"To help solve this problem, Pfizer is working hard to find long-term, sustainable solutions to improve the affordability of medicines in the US without requiring patients to incur safety risks from importation."
,,,"PUblic POlicyPfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report 89 Working to Expand Health Insurance Coverage The problem of the uninsured plagues the American healthcare system, with approximately 47 million Americans lacking health coverage."
,,,"Progress on the issue, however, has been stymied by the vastly different approaches of various stakeholders."
,,,But now there is a change.
,,,"For the past two years, Pfizer has participated in a diverse coalition of 16 groups including healthcare providers, trade associations and activist groups determined to rethink the issue and lay out a path for progress."
,,,Together the groups developed consensus recommendations for covering a significant number of the uninsured and formed the Health Coverage Coalition for the Uninsured (HCCU) to move these recommendations forward.
,,,"On January 18, 2007, the Coalition released an agreement which all the parties endorsed."
,,,The HCCU agreed to certain key principles: 1 Making coverage available to those who could least afford it 2 Relying upon incentives and voluntary approaches 3 Building on the employer-based system and not weakening incentives for employers to provide coverage 4 Using a combination of public and private approaches to expand coverage 5 Recognizing the budget challenge facing most states and 6 Recognizing the importance of consumer outreach and education on health coverage options.
,,,The HCCU’s recommendations advocate coverage expansion for the uninsured occurring in two phases.
,,,"In Phase I, the focus would be on children."
,,,"In Phase II, the key recommendations are to eliminate family status as an eligibility requirement, and to give states an option to expand coverage to all adults with incomes under the federal poverty level."
,,,"In both phases, the recommendations represent a balance of public- and private-sector options."
,,,"We are also working with the Coalition to Advance Health Reform.Supporting Legislation for Smokefree Air Pfizer supports legislation to eliminate the hazards of secondhand smoke from the workplace, and other public places."
,,,"We joined the Campaign for Smokefree Air (CSA), a grassroots coalition, to advance this cause for prevention and wellness."
,,,Our partnership with the CSA aims to help make Michigan the 30 th state to protect its workers from deadly exposure to secondhand smoke.
,,,"As a member of the CSA’s Steering Committee, we are also the first and only pharmaceutical company actively participating in this effort."
,,,Secondhand smoke causes severe health repercussions.
,,,"Michigan absorbs approximately $3.4 billion a year in related productivity losses and spends, through Medicaid, $1.04 billion to cover health costs associated with smoking."
,,,"These are some of the reasons why 63 percent of Michigan’s registered voters support a new state law to ensure smokefree workplaces, restaurants and bars."
,,,"With such support, CSA is aggressively pushing for the passage of Senate Bills 109 and 110 and House Bill 4163 to secure these smokefree environments."
,,,"Partners in the 60-member CSA, along with Pfizer, include the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association of Michigan, the Michigan State Medical Society, the Michigan Health and Hospital Association, among other medical provider organizations and health advocacy groups."
,,,PUblic POlicy90 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility ReportStrengthening Intellectual Property Protection We believe that appropriate incentives for biomedical innovation fuel the discovery and development of new cures and treatments.
,,,That’s what the track record shows.
,,,"The research-based pharmaceutical industry depends on patent rights because they provide needed incentives to make expensive, high-risk investments in biomedical discovery and development."
,,,This is where new medicines come from.
,,,"It costs on average about $800 million to discover, develop and manufacture one approved medicine before it enters the market, with no guarantee of success."
,,,Patents guarantee a limited period of exclusive marketing rights for approved medicines in order to earn a fair return on such a large investment.
,,,"In short, patent protection is the only proven system of bringing new medicines to society in a timely manner."
,,,"This is why we are helping emerging markets strengthen their regulatory systems, including intellectual property rights protection."
,,,"We believe that strong patent laws, when balanced with reasonable times of exclusive marketing rights, lead to more medicines and, ultimately, less disease."
,,,There is a view that patent rights limit access to medicines because they prohibit the unauthorized manufacture and sale of a patented medicine.
,,,We disagree that patents are a primary cause of limited access to medicines.
,,,"The fact is, 90 percent of the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines are no longer patented and still do not reach the people who need them."
,,,"Further, these medicines were originally discovered and developed by private industry."
,,,"As noted in this report, we’re working actively to form public- private partnerships to improve access to medicines around the world.Right to Privacy for Patient Information and PhysiciansThe right to privacy is fundamental, but it’s being challenged as our society becomes more reliant on electronic forms of communication and information technology."
,,,"That’s why electronic prescribing, when physicians use electronic methods to send prescriptions to pharmacies and hospitals, is being scrutinized so carefully."
,,,"We believe that electronic prescribing, done with proper safeguards, is an increasingly valuable and important tool for protecting patient safety, enhancing patient treatment and improving overall efficiency."
,,,We believe the following guidelines should apply: • Patient and physician needs should drive the design of e-prescribing tools that will be used at the point of care.
,,,A market-driven approach will best assure the adoption of systems aligned with the provision of quality care.
,,,• E-prescribing should be provided through a neutral and open platform and conform to prevailing quality and technical standards.
,,,It should not be designed to advance the commercial interest of any particular participant to the potential detriment of patient care.
,,,• Patient privacy must be protected.
,,,"• All messages transmitted to physicians and their staffs through e-prescribing systems must be sourced, accurate, and fact-based."
,,,"• E-prescribing technologies should support greater access to data for better clinical decision-making, including alerts to adverse events and access to formulary information."
,,,"Such information should not be selectively or competitively pushed to the physician, and the distribution of such information must not diminish the patient’s right to appeal."
,,,• E-prescribing must not subvert the protections offered to patients in other areas of Medicare.
,,,"PUblic POlicyPfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report 91 Public Policy in Europe New Approaches to Healthcare In Europe we are changing how we embed the needs of our stakeholders into the value Pfizer provides them—not only through medical and scientific value, but by also integrating social value."

,,,"We call this “customer facing.” For a description of how we implement this in Sales and Marketing through ACE (Aligning Customer Excellence), please see page 84."
,,,"Our transformation is supported by hiring a far more diverse colleague base that comes from the array of social interests in healthcare: patients, pharmacists, payers, government decision-makers, policymakers, economists and NGOs."
,,,"By allocating our resources to hiring people with these backgrounds, we are embedding the thinking, culture and needs of the groups from which they come."
,,,"Below, and elsewhere in this report, are some results of our Stakeholder Model approach (see pages 10-11): Pfizer Europe Advisory Council Pfizer Europe expanded the Europe Advisory Council, which meets regularly with our management on commercial goals."
,,,"To better serve patients, we included diverse social and economic interests, in addition to the medical and scientific interests, associated with particular medicines."
,,,"For example, for Champix ®, our smoking cessation medicine, we included diverse experts from international organizations, Ministries of Health, patients, trade unions and others, in addition to medical and scientific experts."
,,,"Our understanding of how Champix ® would serve patients better was enhanced, shifting us from an insular approach to a stakeholder-focused approach."
,,,Healthy Ageing Pfizer Europe has established a “Healthy Ageing” Platform to guide “partnering and communicating differently” that aligns with the public’s acknowledged desire for staying well.
,,,Active work with the EU Commission on a Resolution of “Active and Healthy Ageing” resulted in a partnership toward Healthcare Systems Reform programs.
,,,"For example: • The Luxembourg Sustainable Health Financing Studies— The Cox Report (named for former President of the EU Parliament, Pat Cox)—have been received by the EU Health Commission • The Alliance for Health and The Future works in the EU to facilitate reforms on Health as an Investment to keep people as productive members of society."

,,,"However, a relatively lax environment on enforcing intellectual property rights (IPR) has had a dampening effect on overseas investment in Israeli companies."
,,,"To raise awareness of this issue, the Business Ethics Center of Jerusalem and Pfizer Israel initiated the “Educating for Intellectual Property Rights” program, in partnership with the Government of Israel and the US Embassy in Tel Aviv."
,,,"In February 2004, the program was introduced into Israeli high schools, and now, over 1,000 teachers have received it."
,,,"The program has been produced in Hebrew, Arabic and English, and several hundred lead teachers have undergone special teacher-training courses."
,,,"The IPR program includes a comprehensive teacher’s guide covering the different forms of intellectual property, such as patent, copyright, design, reputation and trademarks; and also discusses cyberspace and intellectual property rights."
,,,"The guide also suggests activities to engage students, such as discussing ethical dilemmas relating to examples of common abuse of IPR, and reading passages about famous inventors that underscore the importance of patenting discoveries."
,,,"THailanD Protecting Patients from Counterfeit Medicines Pfizer Thailand has been working with government departments, local enforcement agencies and other stakeholders to raise awareness and strengthen collaboration in actions against counterfeit medicines."
,,,"A recent anti-counterfeiting workshop attracted strong attendance and media interest, and helped facilitate improved communication and commitments to address the dangers of counterfeit medicines."

,,,"In addition, this program aims to significantly reduce the burden on the under-resourced public healthcare system."
,,,The establishment of medical schemes for low-income beneficiaries is considered to be a significant step towards the achievement of Social Health Insurance in South Africa.
,,,"Medical schemes will charge lower premiums and, in turn, the pharmaceutical industry will subsidize drug prices."

,,,"At Pfizer, we ask: “How can we help meet the health needs of people today, without compromising our ability to meet the health needs of people tomorrow?” We believe the most workable answer lies in our dual approach: • Sustainable enterprise—investing in the business • Sustainable development—investing in the community."
,,,"Sustainable enterprise includes establishing research partnership agreements, local manufacturing capabilities, and R&D centers to discover and develop new medicines."
,,,It also means supporting intellectual property rights so we and other innovators can help meet the health needs of people tomorrow.
,,,"Sustainable development includes working with local government to understand their health priorities and then forming partnerships to meet those needs by improving disease awareness, providing needed treatment and building healthcare capacity."
,,,Pfizer China is a good example of how our approach to sustainability works.
,,,"After entering the market in 1984, we now have a presence in more than 50 cities, with 2,100 employees."
,,,"We have introduced over 40 medicines to China and have four state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Dalian, Suzhou and Wuxi."
,,,"In 2005 we opened an R&D center in Shanghai, and today we have public health programs in six disease areas ranging from HIV/AIDS to hypertension."
,,,"In 2006, Pfizer China was ranked by Forbes magazine as one of the most philanthropic multinational companies."

,,,"Hypertension In November 2006, Pfizer began working with Shanghai’s Center for Disease Prevention and Control to help manage and reverse hypertension and related cardiovascular risk factors."
,,,Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disease burden in urban centers in China.
,,,"The goal is to fully utilize the resources and infrastructure of local hospitals to improve diagnosis and disease management, as well as provide education and training to improve skills at selected hospitals."
,,,"Stress Management In March 2006, Pfizer China and Song Jiang University Town launched a joint effort called the Mental Health and Stress Management Training Project."
,,,"The project is designed to raise awareness about mental disorders among university faculty, so they can help recognize and prevent such disorders among their students."
,,,The project also offers free psychological counseling to the tens of thousands of students at the eight colleges within the university.
,,,"Smoking Cessation China, with approximately 350 million smokers, produces and consumes more cigarettes than any other country in the world."

,,,"Managing Pfizer’s Transformation Pfizer currently has 89,000 employees worldwide."
,,,"In late 2006 and early 2007, the company committed to reducing its workforce by approximately 10 percent of Pfizer’s worldwide employee base in line with evolving changes in the marketplace."
,,,Planning for Pfizer’s transformation began in early 2005 with teams of colleagues in each division analyzing issues and priorities.
,,,"As the pace increased in 2006 the challenges of leading change were met through a robust set of strategies including senior-level communications, colleague focus groups, and providing managers and colleagues with useful tools to help them deal with the unprecedented pace of change across the company."
,,,"During this period, we launched several initiatives focused on strengthening supervisors’ skills in leading change, colleague retention and building colleague resilience."
,,,"Leadership Education and Development Pfizer invests in the development of programs to educate and prepare those who supervise others, ensuring a pipeline of “ready now” leaders."

,,,"For example: • We rebuilt an entire lab to lower workstations, so scientists in wheelchairs are able to do the research they love without compromise."
,,,• We have physical therapy centers at several of our facilities because muscular-skeletal problems are the most common workplace disability.
,,,"We conduct ergonomic assessments, so workstations can be reconfigured to offset repetitive stress."
,,,"• In 2006 we created the Disability Networking Group, which promotes professional opportunities for Pfizer colleagues, and those interested in becoming Pfizer colleagues, who have physical, developmental, and/or other disabilities.Establishing HIV/AIDS Workplace Policy Pfizer is committed to its global policies on HIV/AIDS (established in November 2004) and the implementation of related programs."

,,,Leaders have “gotten out of the office” and are spending significant time with the sales force and meeting community and state leaders.
,,,"As a follow-up to these events, “Reports from the Road” are posted on our Intranet site."
,,,These are webcam dispatches in which the CEO shares his informal views on his trips around the company.
,,,"Two-way communications between senior management and colleagues recently improved with the redesign of PfizerWorld, the company’s Intranet-based magazine."
,,,"The site now features The Exchange, a forum through which members of the Executive Leadership Team speak about critical issues affecting the company—from the cancellation of the torcetrapib clinical trials (see page 27) to Pfizer’s reorganization."
,,,The Exchange serves as a portal for Pfizer leaders and colleagues to communicate with one another.
,,,Colleagues can also submit ideas directly to Chairman and CEO Jeff Kindler.
,,,"He has received thousands of recommendations, questions and feedback on a range of issues."
,,,"As another example of new ways of communicating, in 2007, Mr. Kindler created the first Pfizer Colleague Advisory Committee."
,,,"This global panel of 15 employees, from all levels and divisions, will serve as a sounding board for the CEO and provide input and suggestions from our colleagues who interact directly with customers."
,,,"In September 2007, every Pfizer colleague in the world will participate in the Pfizer Colleague Engagement Survey and action planning."
,,,"Pfizer utilizes the Gallup G2 ® survey that measures the most significant drivers of colleague engagement and inclusion, which directly relate to productivity, retention and shareholder value."
,,,This process includes a confidential survey with the results provided at the supervisor level which form the basis for specific action plans to improve the work environment.
,,,It will also drive colleague engagement and a greater sense of inclusion and merit-based career advancement and rewards.102 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report eMPLoYeeSaWarDs an D reCogni Tion Working Mother named Pfizer one of the 100 Best Companies of 2006—the eighth time Pfizer was so honored.
,,,Pfizer is one of 30 companies named to the National Association of Female Executives (NAFE) Top Companies for Executive Women list for 2007.
,,,Nikkei Woman in Japan ranked Pfizer as among the top 100 companies for women in 2006.
,,,Pfizer earned a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equity Index for the third year in a row.
,,,"Urban League’s New York Chapter named Pfizer a 2007 “Champion of Diversity” for creating and sustaining an environment of inclusion.Eliminating Bureaucracy Making Pfizer a great place to work includes creating a more agile, flexible and empowered organization to speed decision- making."
,,,Colleagues like to get things done.
,,,"To that end, we have begun efforts to unleash the talent and potential of our colleagues by: • Eliminating bureaucracy and reducing management layers so that leaders are closer to their Pfizer teams and customers."
,,,We are in the midst of reducing the number of layers between the top and bottom of the organization from fourteen to eight.
,,,This reduction in layers is intended to not only bring leaders closer to customers and patients but will push decision-making down to increase speed and customer focus.
,,,"• Giving Pfizer colleagues more freedom to make decisions, be more creative, and have clearer accountability."
,,,"As an example, we are in the process of extending the span of control of supervisors with the intent of empowering colleagues and allowing managers to focus on leading and developing their staffs."
,,,"We are also building a stronger performance-based culture by reviewing our compensation systems at all levels of the organization in 2007, so there is a more direct link between rewards, performance and total shareholder return."
,,,"This will require improved performance planning and evaluation, as well as building talent at every level of the organization."
,,,"Pfizer is building on its 2005 success of making compensation more transparent to colleagues by increasing the emphasis on business performance and increasing the differentiation of rewards relative to individual and team performance.MANUFACTURING / SUPPLY CHAIN Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report 103 manUfactUring / SUPPly chain 104 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report2006/2007 key aCT ions Conducted more than 100 onsite reviews at the facilities of contract manufacturers and researchers, key suppliers, and outsourced logistic centers in 2006 to assure environment, health and safety (EHS) responsibility of our supply chain."
,,,Continued to build a supplier base that reflects the changing demographics of the consumer marketplace through a comprehensive Supplier Diversity program.
,,,"Expanded our Responsible Contracting initiative across all Pfizer divisions in the US.Pfizer is committed to assuring quality, safety and consistency in the manufacture of our human and animal health products, while making sure the actions of individuals and organizations within our supply chain are consistent with the highest standards of business and personal ethics."
,,,Systematically Improving Quality Quality in everything we do is critical because our products help people lead healthier lives.
,,,"Today, every major country or region has legal requirements that apply to Pfizer products, including sophisticated standards of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) against which regulatory agencies examine all pharmaceutical companies."
,,,These efforts are supported by a number of corporate functions within our Legal Division.
,,,"Our Corporate Regulatory Compliance (CRC) organization, with experts across the globe, verifies compliance through periodic audits of Pfizer and selected contractor sites, as well as through measures of quality performance."
,,,"A risk-based analysis of each site, which considers products, activities, technology, and compliance history, determines the frequency and duration of audits."
,,,Quality performance measures include such things as number of recalls and compliance incidents and events.
,,,These measures and audit results are reviewed by business unit management and may be shared with our Chief Compliance Officer or raised for discussion at our Corporate Compliance Committee meetings.
,,,"Our Right First Time strategy for manufacturing is making a significant contribution to quality assurance and risk mitigation, and reflects our commitment to quality in everything we do."
,,,Right First Time promotes the use of innovative technologies and a set of tools that will improve process understanding and reduce variability in manufacturing operations.
,,,Manufacturing and CRC colleagues around the world are extensively trained in the use of Right First Time technology and tools and have made significant improvement in the quality of our processes and products.manUfactUring / SUPPly chain Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report 105 Another essential factor in maintaining GMP compliance is understanding and influencing ever-changing regulatory expectations.
,,,"Our regulatory monitoring functions gather, evaluate and disseminate emerging regulations and guidance to the Pfizer community."
,,,We have also taken an industry- leading role in interacting with the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) to communicate the value of recasting GMP regulations based on scientific and risk management principles.
,,,Reducing Costs Pfizer has initiated a Technology and Innovation strategy for its manufacturing facilities to reduce costs by $5 billion over 10 years.
,,,"As part of this strategy we are exploring manufacturing methods not traditionally found in the pharmaceutical industry, especially continuous manufacturing processes, and the development of new material options designed to reduce the cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients."
,,,"Improving EHS Performance of Contract Manufacturers and Key Suppliers Our commitment to responsible environment, health and safety (EHS) management goes far beyond our facilities’ boundaries."
,,,We use stringent environmental performance criteria in assessing and selecting contract manufacturers and key Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) suppliers.
,,,We are also committed to helping our contract manufacturers and key suppliers in the developing world improve their EHS competency.
,,,"By helping to elevate the EHS performance of these contract manufacturers and suppliers, their workers and communities benefit, and we protect ourselves against business interruption that could impact contractual obligations."
,,,"To assure EHS responsibility in our supply chain, our EHS professionals in 2006 conducted more than 100 onsite reviews at the facilities of contract manufacturers and researchers, key suppliers, and outsourced logistic centers."
,,,"Reviews were done in all regions of the world, with a focus on China and India."
,,,The results are communicated to our procurement groups and considered in supplier decisions.
,,,Our supplier EHS review program is a key part of our supplier selection criteria.
,,,We use a two-tier approach.
,,,The top tier includes contract manufacturers and researchers for APIs or finished drug products that contain potent compounds.
,,,"It also includes key suppliers of drug products and chemicals that are critical to the supply chain, such as high-value, unique chemical entity or single source suppliers."
,,,"The second tier includes contract manufacturers that do not use potent compounds, do not make APIs and are considered less critical."
,,,"If suppliers are rated as acceptable with qualifications, the qualifications are shared with the supplier and an action plan is requested to address the areas of concern."
,,,"If a potential new supplier is found to be unacceptable, we will not do business with the entity until the concerns are addressed."
,,,"If an existing supplier is rated as not acceptable, we typically work with the supplier to improve performance, or we may also end the relationship."
,,,Pfizer also actively supports EHS management improvement at many suppliers.
,,,"In November 2006, for example, we sponsored a one-week intensive EHS training course in Shanghai, China, focusing on occupational hygiene and process safety."
,,,"The training was conducted by internationally recognized consultants, with Pfizer facilitating discussions."
,,,Sixty participants representing six key suppliers attended the course.
,,,"Integrating EHS Criteria in the Purchase of Goods and Services Integrating EHS criteria into our purchasing decisions for goods and services can reduce our cost, improve the quality of the product or service, reduce risks to our business, and reduce environmental degradation."
,,,"For these reasons we have been examining categories of goods and services, identifying opportunities and risks in these purchases, working to develop EHS specifications and defining the methods by which we can measure the benefits of such purchases."
,,,One example of how such “green purchasing” benefits Pfizer and the environment is in the use of office paper.
,,,Sixty-eight percent of the printer and copier paper we purchased in the US in 2005 was recycled paper.
,,,The foresting practices used to produce the raw material for the paper we bought were certified as sustainable under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.
,,,"In making this choice we helped save 8,068 trees, 1,645,887 kilowatt hours of energy (enough to power 61 homes for one year), and 321 metric tons of related carbon dioxide (CO 2) and other atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions (equal to the amount of CO 2 from the operation of 64 cars per year)."
,,,We are currently purchasing printer and copier paper with 30 percent post-consumer waste recycled content.manUfactUring / SUPPly chain 106 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility ReportIncreasing Supplier Diversity The objective of our Supplier Diversity program is to build a supplier base that reflects the changing demographics of the consumer marketplace while helping Pfizer increase market share and shareholder value.
,,,"In order to do this, we have implemented a three-part strategy: • Create opportunities through our sourcing process to increase our spending with minority and women-owned businesses."
,,,"Over the last several years, we have increased such spending by 10 percent a year, well above the pharmaceutical industry average."
,,,"Small businesses, service-disabled veterans and veterans are included in our Supplier Diversity Program."
,,,• Provide executive educational programs for our diversity suppliers and diversity education training and development for internal colleagues.
,,,"For example, over the past three years, we have provided scholarships for minority and women-owned businesses to attend the Tuck School of Business Minority Executive Education Program at Dartmouth College."
,,,"This program helps entrepreneurs with such issues as building strategic alliances, marketing and organizational development."
,,,"Internally, we focus on goal setting and techniques to identify minority and women suppliers."
,,,"• Align with advocacy organizations, such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC)."
,,,These leading advocacy and certification organizations provide certification and business development opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses.
,,,"We support these organizations through local and national board memberships and sponsorships of conferences and workshops.Responsible Contracting Two years ago, we implemented a Responsible Contracting initiative in the US for use on all major capital projects, site services and service contracts."
,,,Pfizer was the first pharmaceutical company to do so.
,,,"Under the initiative, contractors and service providers may bid to Pfizer provided they comply with “responsible contracting” prequalification criteria that include paying appropriate wages, providing family health insurance and job training, complying with employment laws, and not using independent contractors."
,,,The company receives services from a broad spectrum of contractors with both union and non-union affiliations.
,,,"Over the past decade, more than $1.2 billion, or approximately 85 percent, of our construction dollars have gone to union contractors."
,,,"Responsible Contracting has helped to expand and diversify Pfizer’s service provider list, attracting new contractors to our sites and new workers to our communities.manUfactUring / SUPPly chain Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report 107 aWarDs an D reCogni Tion The Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) has recognized Pfizer as one of the 2006 Top Corporations for Women’s Business Enterprises."
,,,This marks the third consecutive year Pfizer has received this honor.
,,,"For the fourth consecutive year, Pfizer has been recognized as the Best Corporation for Multicultural Business Opportunities by DiversityBusiness.com."
,,,"The online survey of minority and women business enterprises considered such factors as external outreach, mentoring, and senior management commitment to diversity."
,,,"Pfizer’s Thane, India manufacturing facility won the Safety, Health & Environment Award from the Confederation of Indian Industries for its education and awareness initiatives.108 Pfizer 2007 Corporate Responsibility Reportwe are looking for sustainable ways to meet healthcare needs around the world, today and tomorrow."
