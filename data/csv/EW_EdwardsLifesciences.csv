"Although we still use ODS in some of our air ‐conditioning systems, including R ‐22, R ‐134A and R ‐410A, we have processes to leak test each unit, recover any spent ODS during maintenance and report emissions to our local air quality management agencies.",EW_2020.pdf
"In 2020, our Puerto Rico facility replaced three older R -22 air conditioning systems with a single, new ODS -free air handling unit and chiller.",EW_2020.pdf
Because our global emissions of ODS are minimal we do not consider them material nor significant to our air emissions reduction efforts .,EW_2020.pdf
It is estimated that no more than 25 kilograms of ODS is emitted annually from all of our locations worldwide.,EW_2020.pdf
"As Edwards leases most of our global non-manufacturing locations, we are not able to control or track the ODS usage for air handling equipment in these office buildings.",EW_2020.pdf
"Other Significant Air Emissions GRI 305- 7 We track hazardous air pollutants and toxic emissions from manufacturing processes and facilities equipment including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), reactive organic gases (ROGs or VOCs) and air toxi cs, such as ethylene oxide.",EW_2020.pdf

Emissions calculations and reporting are verified by Global EHS during periodic audits to ensure accurac y and compliance with permits and local limits .,EW_2020.pdf
"We also install air pollution control equipment where it is available and technologically feasible, such as installing catalytic convertors on emergency generators, dust collectors in machine shops and treat ment systems for our sterilization operations.",EW_2020.pdf
"We calculate NOx, S Ox, ROG/VOC, PM, and CO based on combustion of direct energy sources at our manufacturing facilities.",EW_2020.pdf
"Although our manufacturing room isopropyl alcohol cleaning processes generate fugitive VOC emissions, we do not include fugitive VOC emissions in our companywide data at this time.",EW_2020.pdf
"How ever, individual locations report their site VOC fugitive emissions as necessary to their local government air quality management agencies.",EW_2020.pdf
We assume a 0.90 confidence level for the hazardous air pollutant emissions reported.,EW_2020.pdf
"In 2020, air emissions rema ined relatively the same as in 2019.",EW_2020.pdf
This can be attributed directly to our consistent year - over-year manufacturing activity and output for 2020.,EW_2020.pdf
"Ethylene Oxide Emissions At our Puerto Rico facility, we perform EO sterilization for both Edwards and non- Edwards medical device products .",EW_2020.pdf
"Our EO sterilizer operates under stringent US OSHA and EPA regulations to protect our employees, neighbors and local environment.",EW_2020.pdf
We treat or neutralize over 99% of all of the EO processed at our facility prior to discharge to the atmosphere.,EW_2020.pdf
We have also installed a c ontinuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) to measure EO output on an ongoing basis and provide alarms or warnings if EO levels become a concern.,EW_2020.pdf
"As required by regulation, t he effectiveness of our contr ol technology is verified by the local environmental agency at regular intervals, and whenever changes in the equipment occur.",EW_2020.pdf
"Edwards Lifesciences 2020 EHS Report 30 In 2020, Edwards had no EO emissions exceedances.",EW_2020.pdf
"In 2020, EO emissions were reduced 39% over the prior year primarily as a result of improving our EO treatment efficiency rate to from 99.6% to 99.8% year over year.",EW_2020.pdf
The increase in pollution control efficiency was primarily due to infrastructure improvements made in ventilation systems and m ore effective methods to capture EO emissions.,EW_2020.pdf
"We also had a decline of EO overall usage of 3% which is attributed to both changing business demand as well as a deliberate decision to transfer some medical device product families to alternative methods of sterilization, which eliminates the need for EO sterilization.",EW_2020.pdf
"Further improvements are planned in 2021 to capture and treat fugitive emissions, as well improve our sterilization cycle efficiency.",EW_2020.pdf
We are also developing strategies to improve our on- site and contracted offsite EO sterilization cycles in order to sterilize our products using reduced EO volumes per sterilization or pallet cycle.,EW_2020.pdf
"Since our baseline of 2015, we have reduced overall EO usage by 49% and absolute emissions by 84 %.",EW_2020.pdf
Climate Risk Edwards identif ies and assesses climate -related risks as part of an integrated approach to managing overall business risk.,EW_2020.pdf
Edwards has established an Enterprise Risk Council to guide the company risk management strategy .,EW_2020.pdf

"For more detailed information on site- by-site water withdraw al (and subsequently discharge), refer to the Water section of this report.",EW_2020.pdf
Hazardous Waste GRI 30 6-2 Edwards defines hazardous waste as any waste with properties that make it dangerous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environm ent.,EW_2020.pdf
"Included in this definition are all wastes which have hazardous characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity and toxicity as well as other regulated wastes such as biohazardous and medical waste (including medical plastics) , electronic waste, fluorescent lamps, and batteries.",EW_2020.pdf
"Other waste materials maybe also be listed as specific hazardous wastes, if required by country or local regulation.",EW_2020.pdf
"In 2020, Edwards disposed of approximately 1, 746 metric ton s (MT) of hazardous waste from our sev en global manufacturing plants .",EW_2020.pdf
This represents an increase of 31% over prior year and an increase of 121% over our 2015 baseline year.,EW_2020.pdf
"While during the same periods, when normalized by revenue, ou r hazardous waste increased 30% year- over-year and only 26% from our 2015 baseline.",EW_2020.pdf
"Even though Edwards has continued to grow in both size and complexity, our hazardous waste generation has outpaced our growth and our five- year result did not match our aggressive long- term target to reduce hazardous waste disposal by 20% when normalized by revenue.",EW_2020.pdf
The increase in hazardous waste generation is primarily attributed to new products and enhancement of manufacturing equipment and processes which aggressively began in 2018 and continued through 2020.,EW_2020.pdf
"Validation of our manufacturing processes is required in order to meet stringent FDA and global medical device quality assurance regulations and involves thorough testing of our equipment, procedures, and chemicals in order to ensure efficac y.",EW_2020.pdf
"While validation activities represent growth and a bright future for our business, validation results in an increase in hazardous waste disposal without resulting financial benefit until the products are brought to market.",EW_2020.pdf
"In 2020, we had major validation activities occurring at four of our seven global manufacturing plants.",EW_2020.pdf
"All of these plants —Singapore, Irvine, Costa Rica, and Ireland—are part of our fast -growing Implant Valve Network.",EW_2020.pdf
"The largest relative increase in hazardous waste disposal was at our Irvine plant, where we saw an increase of 57% over the prior year associated with the development of new product and manufacturing technologies, followed by increases in Costa Rica of 41% and Singapore of 23%.",EW_2020.pdf
All of these increases are a result of investing in our Heart Valve Implant network ’s future product improvements and manufacturing innovations.,EW_2020.pdf
Our established Caribbean based Critical Care operations realized reductions over prior years with Puerto Rico decreasing by 3% and Dominic an Republic decreasing by 1 4%.,EW_2020.pdf
"Edwards Lifesciences 2020 EHS Report 37 Our total cost for hazardous waste disposal in 2020 was $1,622,000, an increase of $154,000 from 2019.",EW_2020.pdf
"From 2015 to 2020, our average hazardous waste disposal cost decreased 22%, from $1.18 per MT in 2015 to $0.93 per MT in 2020.",EW_2020.pdf
"This reduction i n cost is due to enhancing our partnerships and efficiencies with our hazardous waste contractors and by instituting processes to more effectively manage higher volume waste streams generated on- site, including the ability to dispos e of bulk production wastes used for beneficial reuse in fuels blendi ng.",EW_2020.pdf
"The overall impact of our year - over-year hazardous waste intensity and cost reductions has been approximately $795,000 in cost avoidance from 2016 to 2020.",EW_2020.pdf
"We recycle approximately 32 % of our hazardous waste, primarily through the energy recovery from high- BTU rated wastes, including manufacturing solvents , most of which are generated at our Costa Rica and Irvine locations .",EW_2020.pdf
Approximately 62% of our hazardous waste is incinerated in order to reduce future liabilities and risks to the community.,EW_2020.pdf
"Less than 2 % of our hazardous waste is not qualified for recycling, incineration or treatment and is disposed of in hazardous waste- authorized landfill s. Non- Hazardous Waste GRI 30 6-2 Edwards defines non- hazardous waste as any waste not managed as hazardous or regulated waste and includes non - hazardous waste which is both disposed and recycled.",EW_2020.pdf
"It primarily includes all wastes that are allowed to be disposed in local landfills, but also may include wastes that are otherwise required to be recycled by local governments .",EW_2020.pdf
"In 2020, Edwards disposed of approximately 2,944 metric tons ( MT) of nonhazardous waste from our seven global manufacturing locations , which represents a 17% reduction from our prior year of 3,547 MT.",EW_2020.pdf
"This figure includes all non- hazardous waste incinerated, treated, sent to landfill, AND recycled.",EW_2020.pdf
"When compared to our baseline year of 2015, we have increased absolute volumes of waste by 37% while Edwards revenue growth during this time period was 74%.",EW_2020.pdf
"Since 2015, Edwards has grown in size and revenue faster than we have increased our non-hazardous waste disposal .",EW_2020.pdf
"When normalized by annual revenue, Edwards has reduced non- hazardous waste disposal by 21% since 2015, thereby beating our five- year target to reduce generation by 20%.",EW_2020.pdf
The reduction in non- hazardous waste is attributed to numerous initiatives at our manufacturing plants as well as reductions in office and nonmanufacturing wastes while employees were working from home during COVID -19.,EW_2020.pdf
The largest impact of our recycling efforts came from significant reductions in recycling of our plastics and corrugate.,EW_2020.pdf
"While plastic recycling increased approximately 5% year -over-year, our corrugate recycling came to a standstill due to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic and the shift to recycling of higher grade corrugate for the global packaging market.",EW_2020.pdf
We hope to s ee this impact rebound in the future years as the economy recovers from the COVID -19 pandemic and the need for recycling of our corrugate increases .,EW_2020.pdf
"In 2019, significant efforts began to reduce packaging waste from our high- volume commercial products and we are continuing these efforts today.",EW_2020.pdf
"We expect that in future years, we will start to see the impact of ongoing packaging waste reduction efforts.",EW_2020.pdf
"Edwards Lifesciences 2020 EHS Report 38 Our total cost for non- hazardous waste disposal in 2020 was $ 393,000.",EW_2020.pdf
"Since 2015, our nonhazardous waste disposal cost, excluding recycling, increased from $201 per MT to $213 per MT, or $12 per MT.",EW_2020.pdf

"While our primary focus is to reduce the overall quantities of waste generated, we understand the importance of ensuring was te is sent for recycling wherever possible.",EW_2020.pdf
"Examples of non- hazardous waste sent for recycling include paper, corrugate, plastics, wood pallets, metal scrap, consumer cans and bottles, cafeteria oils and grease, electronics, and landscaping waste.",EW_2020.pdf
"Exampl es of hazardous waste sent for recycling include manufacturing solvents, water diluted with biocides, medical plastics, fluorescent lamps, and batteries.",EW_2020.pdf
"We recycled 1,318 metric tons (MT) of non-hazardous waste and 559 MT of hazardous waste from our manufacturing locations in 2020.",EW_2020.pdf
"This represents 40 % recycling rate for our total company waste, which is a 5 % increase from 201 9.",EW_2020.pdf
"Since 2015, Edwards has maintained a consistent total recycling rate of recycling approximatel y 40% of all of our total waste generated, even with continuous fluctuations in our hazardous and nonhazardous waste volumes.",EW_2020.pdf
"In 2020, Edwards invested $46,383 in recycling of nonhazardous waste at our global manufacturing locations.",EW_2020.pdf
"While the cost of recycling varies greatly from country -to-country , Edwards makes every effort to promote recycling regardless of whether there is a financial benefit or a cost.",EW_2020.pdf
"Due to technological complexities in the different countries in which we operate, approximatel y half of our sites pay to recycle, while other half receive payment.",EW_2020.pdf
Other recycling initiatives are required by our landlord and property management companies and incorporated into our lease agreements.,EW_2020.pdf
"Incidents and Adverse Impacts GRI 30 6-3, 306-4 In 2020, Edwards had no significant spills or environmental releases above regulatory reporting thresholds at any of our locations worldwide nor did Edwards have any adverse incidents related to transportation of hazardous materials .",EW_2020.pdf

"Our commitment to preventing injury and illness and promot ing well-being extends to both manufacturing and non- manufacturing operations and includes all employees, as well as contractors and visitors present at our facilities as well as our local communities .",EW_2020.pdf
Both internal and external stakeholders consider Occupational Health & Safety to be a material topic for Edwards.,EW_2020.pdf
Edwards’ Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System is based on the industr y-recognized principles of ISO 45001:2018.,EW_2020.pdf
"Critical elements of our EHS Management System include: • Implementing an OHS management system not only to meet our regulatory obligations, but to provide a framework of injury and illness prevention and continual improvement • Establishing an Edwards EHS Policy rooted in our Credo and Aspirations • Demonstrating leadership commitment to EHS • Identifying significant risks , opportunities, environmental impacts and safety hazards • Developing EHS objectives at bot h corporate and manufacturing plant -levels • Establishing and implementing systems to maintain compliance, prevent injuries and reduce pollution • Executing EHS programs, processes, and operational controls • Evaluating performance through internal and third- party audits and management reviews • Identifying and executing continual improvement opportunities As part of our EHS Management System, our EHS strategy and objectives are reviewed and adjusted annual ly.",EW_2020.pdf
Performance against objectives is tracked on a monthly basis at the manufacturing plant and regional levels.,EW_2020.pdf
"Specifically, for manufacturing, OHS objectives are incorporated into plant -level scorecards which include both injury and illness rate targets and OHS leading indicator criteria .",EW_2020.pdf
"Hazard Identificat ion, Risk Assessment, and Incident Investigation GRI 403- 2 Edwards adopts a risk -based approach to managing safety, consistent with ISO 45001:2018 principles.",EW_2020.pdf
Manufacturing Plant EHS teams work with local supervisors and manufacturing associates to quantify risk s associated with various job activities.,EW_2020.pdf
"Risk assessments may take the form of a sitewide safety risk register , job safety analyses (JSAs), process hazard analyses (PHAs), industrial hygiene risk assessments , ergonomic risk assessments or personal protective equipment (PPE) assessments.",EW_2020.pdf
"We also complete EHS evaluations for new equipment, including such areas as machine safety, ergonomics and personal protective equipment.",EW_2020.pdf
"Where risk s are found to be above predetermined acceptable threshold level s, additional measures are implemented to control the hazards and lower the risk s. Edwards follows the Hierarchy of Controls when implementing safety hazard control measures .",EW_2020.pdf
"Additionally, Edwards encourages employees to be proactive in identifying hazards in their work areas.",EW_2020.pdf
Employees are free to report any hazard or concern without fear of reprisal and some of our safety reporting programs allow for anonymous reporting.,EW_2020.pdf
"Edwards sites employ various methods to facilitate hazard identification, including safety suggestion boxes, Facilities Help Tickets, Good Saves programs and other near miss and safety concern reporting programs .",EW_2020.pdf
Hazards may also be identified during facilities or product design review and during routine inspections or safety walks .,EW_2020.pdf
"Once hazards or concerns are reported, they are reviewed, routed to the appropriate personnel and tracked to resolution.",EW_2020.pdf
"When EHS-related incidents occur, Edwards requires that a thorough investigation be completed to identify the root cause and ensure corrective actions are tak en to remove the immediate hazards and prevent recurrence.",EW_2020.pdf
"Incident investigations are conducted by the responsible supervisor and manager with support from the local EHS team, and Edwards Lifesciences 2020 EHS Report 46 may include interviews, a walkthrough of the incident scene, review of doc ument s and records and review of surveillance videotape or photos .",EW_2020.pdf
"At Edwards, we emphasize that the purpose of an incident investigation is to prevent recurrence, not to find fault nor assign blame.",EW_2020.pdf
Corrective and preventive actions resulting from the i ncident investigation are tracked to closure.,EW_2020.pdf
"Employee Participation, Consultation and Communication GRI 403- 4 Due to local cultures and differing regulations, each of Edwards’ manufacturing locations employs a different strategy towards encouraging management ‐employee interface with regard to workplace health and safety.",EW_2020.pdf
"For example, regulations at our Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and Singapore locations require us to establish safety committees comprised of both management and produc tion employees, conduct periodic meetings, maintain minutes of discussions, conduct joint investigations of accidents and near misses and report their committee status to the local government safety authorities.",EW_2020.pdf
"In some cases, we must also notify the local health authorities of who is on our safety committees and provide access to our meeting agendas and action items.",EW_2020.pdf
"In Irvine, Californi a, we have identified approximately 50 key supervisors and they attend EHS trainings and discussions each month with the Irvine EHS team.",EW_2020.pdf
"These 50 supervisors, in turn, communicate with their own manufacturing and laboratory departments and discuss EHS topics with their own individual employees.",EW_2020.pdf
Each supervisor is thus able to customize the safety topics and discussions to fit his or her individual department’s risks and opportunities.,EW_2020.pdf
"In Puerto Rico, our safety committee is typically 63% employees and 37% management.",EW_2020.pdf
The committee holds weekly safety meetings.,EW_2020.pdf
"The agenda is well structured, published and always start s with a Safety Minute covered by a volunteer sharing a safety event from their personal life.",EW_2020.pdf
"Many times, the personal safety experience relates back to the working environment.",EW_2020.pdf
The Puerto Rican team also shares safety minutes at All ‐Employee meetings hosted by our General Manager and other members of the leadership team.,EW_2020.pdf
"As part of our culture of ownership and accountability, we expect our Plant Leadership to own worker participation and consultation programs at the plant -level.",EW_2020.pdf
We typically do not tr ack information about specific worker ‐management representation and topics of discussion at our manufacturing sites at the Global EHS level.,EW_2020.pdf
"However, Global EHS receives reports on and monitors high risks or opportunities, such as those directly related to employee injuries, accidents or significant near misses.",EW_2020.pdf
"As each location is different in terms of culture and risk, we do not employ a single approach to soliciting feedback and participation from our global employees.",EW_2020.pdf
"However, we apply common elements as appropriate: • Encouraging employees to participate in hazard identification and Speak Up if they determine workplace conditions may be unsafe or may be improved • Site-level safety committees and management -employee open forums • Employee anonymous suggestion programs : such as our corporate Ask Mike (our CEO) and equivalent plant level programs to anonymously ask our plant leaders questions • Employee hazard or Good Save programs • Edwards’ anonymous Speak ‐Up and Integrity Hotline open to both internal employees and external stakeholders to report ethics or confidential concerns • Process improvement and Kaizen activities • Cross -functional team evaluation of equipment and product lines during design, purchasing and validation • Utilization of contractors and consultants for professional and technical feedback on OHS programs and risks • Utilizing our Occupational Health services professionals and nurses to participate in identifying workplace hazards, evaluating potentially impacted employees, tr eating employees who are injured or have a workplace illness (including cumulative trauma) and participating in our investigation and corrective action processes Training and Awareness GRI 403- 5 Each of our global manufacturing locations provides EHS training in order to ensure compliance with EHS regulations and educate our employees on safe and environmentally responsible work practices and procedures .",EW_2020.pdf

"Training plans are structured by the EHS team who is most familiar with applicable safety and compliance requirements, and then assigned in our Learning Management System (LMS) by supervisors who are most familiar with their employees and their work tasks .",EW_2020.pdf
Training completion is tracked in our LMS.,EW_2020.pdf
All of global manufacturing locations are held accountable for meeting their regulatory and company required training obligations through our Corporate EHS and 3rd party auditing programs (see EHS Compliance section of this Report ).,EW_2020.pdf
"For EHS topics , like slip and fall awareness, which are not covered in formal training courses but might require general employee awareness , there are a variety of means to communicate these safety messages.",EW_2020.pdf
"Some of these means include safety communication boards and television screens, electronic newsletters , Injury Flash Alerts and team huddle safety talks .",EW_2020.pdf
"Additionally, we recognize that the continual development of our global EHS professionals is fundamental to the success of our EHS program.",EW_2020.pdf
"Annually, EHS professionals set development plans as part the Edwards Talent Development Program.",EW_2020.pdf
"In addition to encouraging EHS professionals to pursue general business and technical degree and certificate programs, the team is encouraged to attend industry conferences , seminars, and training classes.",EW_2020.pdf
"Currently many of our global EHS professionals hold Lead Auditor certificati ons in one or both ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018, creating a network of internal auditing resources within Edwards .",EW_2020.pdf
"In future years, our network of internal auditors will travel across our global sites and business units for cross -auditing purposes to benefit Edwards EHS program and further enrich the development of our EHS professionals.",EW_2020.pdf
"Occupational Health Services and Promotion of Worker Health GRI 403- 3, GRI 403-6 We believ e the well -being of our employees has a direct correlation with the success of our safety and environmental performance.",EW_2020.pdf
Healthier employees tend to have fewer injuries and participate more openly in our EHS programs to help us identify risks and opportunit ies for improvement.,EW_2020.pdf
"In conjunction with traditional employee benefits of insurance, vacations, medical leave, and other work policies, we also provide a variety of benefits focused on overall employee health and safety at work .",EW_2020.pdf
"Each of our s even global manufacturing locations provide benefits associated with occupational health and safety commensurate to their work er population, culture and availability of such programs in their local communities.",EW_2020.pdf

"Security considerations which do not directly impact our employee health or the environment, such as cyber security or intellectual property protection, are not within the scope of this Report but are discussed elsewhere in our 2019 Edwards Sustainability Report .",EW_2020.pdf
At each of our global manufacturing plant s we implement security measures commensurate to the assessed risks to our employees and facilities.,EW_2020.pdf
"Although security is managed locally by each site, our overall security strategies and objectives are directed by our Irvine- based Corporate Services Security Team.",EW_2020.pdf
Security personnel are the first point of contact for guests and contractors arriving at our Edwards manufacturing plants .,EW_2020.pdf
"Security personnel not only screen individuals before entering our properties, but also help communicate our EHS and Security policies at the point of entry.",EW_2020.pdf
"While security measures taken at each manufacturing plant are customized to local needs, the following controls are commonly deployed: • Gated and fenced properties • Professional contracted security services; 24/7 guards and security personnel • Remotely accessed surveillance cameras • Employee badge readers • Contractor screening processes • Escorted guest s and visitors • Alarm systems and notification devices with automatic notifications to local authorities • Emergency response plans to address security and other concerns • Participation in employee accident and injury events to ensure emergency responders have access to the injured persons as well as isolating nonessential persons from incident scenes • Department of Homeland Security (USA) Hazardous Materials Security Plans , where applicable • Training of contracted security personnel in Edwards applicable EHS procedures and protocols • Protection of hazardous materials in locked cages and storage areas • First responders for emergencies occurring after -hours • Department of Transportation security plans for transport of hazardous materials at US locations Based on our Corporate Sustainability materiality assessment EHS security was not determined to be a material topic by our internal and external stakeholders.",EW_2020.pdf
"Still, because security may have a direct impact on the safety of our employees and protection of the environment, we implement procedures and measures to manage potential security risks.",EW_2020.pdf
We also incorporate security into our global Business Continuity and Risk Management strategies.,EW_2020.pdf
"Edwards Lifesciences 2020 EHS Report 55 Community Engagement Impact to Community Engagement from COVID -19 in 2 020: COVID -19 safety protocols restricted our manufacturing locations’ community outreach programs as most of these involve volunteer groups gathering for such programs as beach cleanups, park tree plantings, outdoor health promotions and various encounters with the public to promote and enhance EHS in our communities.",EW_2020.pdf
GRI 4 13-1 At Edwards we respect and value human health and the environmental well -being of the communities in which we live and operate.,EW_2020.pdf
We aspire to demonstrate passionate engagement that strengthens our communities .,EW_2020.pdf
"This is evident in the results of our materiality assessment, which indicate that Volunteerism and Giving as a highly material topic for Edwards.",EW_2020.pdf
"While our Global Corporate Giving strategy drives mo st of our philanthropy programs, many community EHS efforts are planned and executed at local levels by employee volunteer teams at our global sites with the support of local management .",EW_2020.pdf
"We take care to ensure that our EHS outreach efforts are meaningful, results -oriented and transparent with our neighbors and communities.",EW_2020.pdf
EHS community engagement events are selected by the site based upon the needs of the local community as well as the interests of our employees.,EW_2020.pdf
"These events often involve beach and park clean‐ ups, reforestation efforts , blood drives, cancer and heart disease awareness walks, and community EHS or emergency preparedness meetings.",EW_2020.pdf
More information on our global philanthropic and community engagement efforts are report ed in our 2020 Edwards Sustainability Report and on the Edwards Global Corporate Giving website.,EW_2020.pdf
"Operations with Significant Ne gative Impacts on Local Communities GRI 4 13-2 We are pleased to report that Edwards has no significant actual or potential negative environmental, health or safety impacts on or local communities.",EW_2020.pdf
