"ResMed 18/19 Report on ESG Issues Page 12 of 48 In February 2020, we adopted an annual election process for our board .",RMD_2019.pdf
"At our 2020 and 2021 annual stockholders’ meetings, the directors proposed for election will serve until the next year’s annual meeting.",RMD_2019.pdf

"There is no limit to the number of terms a director may serve, nor a set retirement age.",RMD_2019.pdf
"The board has adopted a majority voting policy, under which an incumbent director who does not receive a majority of votes for re -election must tender a resi gnation to the board.",RMD_2019.pdf
"The board will determine whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, and disclose the results and rationale within 90 days of the election.",RMD_2019.pdf
The chair of the board’s Nominating and Governance Committee (currently Ron Taylor) also serves as our lead director.,RMD_2019.pdf
"The lead director presides over meetings of our independent directors (generally held each quarter), acts as a liaison between the independent directors and chairman, communicates with stockholders as appropriate, and fulfills other duties that support sound corporate governance.",RMD_2019.pdf
"Under our corporate governance guidelines, directors have direct access to company management to secure the information they need for their duties.",RMD_2019.pdf

"Board and executive remuneration Our board’s C ompensation Committee reviews cash compensation , benefits , perquisites, and equity compensation of directors and executives , including target and actual short -term incentives.",RMD_2019.pdf
The committee’s in -depth review of director and executives ’ compensation is published in our proxy statement to stockholders before ResMed’s annual general meetings.,RMD_2019.pdf
The principles governing our executive compensation program include: ResMed 18/19 Report on ESG Issues Page 13 of 48 • Pay-for-performance.,RMD_2019.pdf
"Pay-for-performance , align ment with stockholder interests , and largely at- risk compensation are the cornerstones of our compensation program.",RMD_2019.pdf
"A significant portion of our executives’ compensation is at risk and tied to the achievement of pre- established short- term corporate financial objectives through our annual cash incentive programs that our corporate officers earn based on achieving our goals relating to adjusted net sales and adjusted operating profit, weighted equally .",RMD_2019.pdf
These two measures represent fundamental financial metrics: top -line sales and the portion of those top -line sales that fall to the bottom line.,RMD_2019.pdf
Our executives in charge of a principal unit have 60% of their incentive opportunity tied to achieving set go als for the same metrics at the business unit level and the remaining 40% tied to the corporate goals.,RMD_2019.pdf
All payouts are determined in accordance with these objective performance metrics.,RMD_2019.pdf
"Executive officer payouts ranged from 96% to 121% of target in F iscal Year 2019 with no discretion applied to the amount paid , with the payouts reflect ing our strong performance and our rigorous goals.",RMD_2019.pdf
• Provide market -competitive compensation .,RMD_2019.pdf
Our objective is to provide a target total compensation program that is competitive with similarly sized US -based public companies in the medical device and medical technology industries with which we compete for executive talent.,RMD_2019.pdf
"The committee reviews ben chmark data for the individual and for the group as a whole, but does not target a specific benchmark level.",RMD_2019.pdf
"For our executives, total target compensation should reflect a relatively lower emphasis on salary and a higher percentage of pay at risk in the fo rm of an annual cash incentive and equity awards.",RMD_2019.pdf
"The guideline is broad, to recognize individual situations, and also allows us to reflect the fact that we set challenging targets for our incentive programs.",RMD_2019.pdf
"• Make informed decision s. The committee has retained FW Cook, Inc., an independent compensation consultant, to advise the committee with respect to compensation matters for executive officers , and to perform a comprehensive market analysis of our executive compensation program, pay levels , and relative operating performance.",RMD_2019.pdf

"Risk and ESG oversight While our full board retains general risk oversight, our board committees oversee particular risks, periodically updating the full board.",RMD_2019.pdf
"The primary risk responsibilities for the committees are: Audit Committee Overseeing financial risk, capital risk , and financial compliance risk, as well a s internal controls over financial reporting Compensation Committee Overseeing our compensation philosophy and practices , as well as the balance between risk -taking and rewards to senior officers Nominating and Governance Committee Evaluating each director’s independence and the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines and code of business conduct, as well as overseeing management’s succession planning ResMed 18/19 Report on ESG Issues Page 14 of 48 Compliance Oversight Committee Reviewing and overseeing matters related to our compliance with United States federal healthcare program requirements and the obligations of ResMed Corp. under the corporate integrity agreement Oversight of general business risks, including but not limited to material environmental and social risks, is retained by the full board.",RMD_2019.pdf

"The following ESG -related risks are among those that face the business: • Government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products ; • Health care reform policies and legislation , including the US Patient Protection , the Affordable Care Act , and changes to the US F ood and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) process, may have material adverse effect s on our industry and our results of operations ; and ResMed 18/19 Report on ESG Issues Page 15 of 48 • Other changes to the FDA’s quality and testing standards, and failure to comply promptly with those standards, may have an adverse effect on our business.",RMD_2019.pdf
"These are in addition to standard business ris ks such as threats from competition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the challenge of supporting continued growth and business acquisitions, disruptions to supply, and intellectual property claims ( see our 2019 annual report ).",RMD_2019.pdf
Business integrity The best protection of integrity is to instill a culture that values honesty and ethics: doing what’s right every day; relying on our pe ople’s good judgment and sense of fairness ; reporting unethical behavior ; and taking appropriate action.,RMD_2019.pdf

It provides contacts for the company’s eth ics compliance officer and our global general counsel should any employee require assistance beyond an immediate supervisor.,RMD_2019.pdf
"Where permissible, we also have a toll -free hotline to an independent company for employees or others who want to speak up but pre fer to remain anonymous.",RMD_2019.pdf
The code prohibits retaliation against any employee who has taken action in good faith to seek help on or report a suspected breach of the code.,RMD_2019.pdf
Ethics and corruption We are committed to a strong ethics and compliance culture.,RMD_2019.pdf
We do not tolerate actions or behaviors that are inconsistent with our values or violate the ResMed Code of Conduct or applicable laws and regulations.,RMD_2019.pdf

Our board is transitioning to annual elections for all directors.,RMD_2021.pdf
"Our board previously was divided into three classes, with each class elected to serve a three-year term.",RMD_2021.pdf
"Beginning with the annual meeting held in 2020, directors standing for election are elected for one-year terms.",RMD_2021.pdf
"Directors elected to three- year terms in 2019, before the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, will complete those terms in 2022, with annual elections once their term expires.",RMD_2021.pdf
"As a result, the entire board will be elected annually beginning with the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders.",RMD_2021.pdf
"There is no limit to the number of terms a director may serve, nor a set retirement age.",RMD_2021.pdf
"The board has adopted a majority voting policy, under which an incumbent director who does not receive a majority of votes for re-election must tender a resignation to the board.",RMD_2021.pdf
"The Nominating and Governance Committee, or another duly authorized committee of the board, will decide whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, generally within 90 days after the election results are certified.",RMD_2021.pdf
The chair of the board’s Nominating and Governance Committee (currently Ron Taylor) also serves as our lead director.,RMD_2021.pdf
"The lead director presides over meetings of our independent directors (generally held each quarter), acts as a liaison between the independent directors and chairman, communicates with stockholders as appropriate, and fulfills other duties that support sound corporate governance.",RMD_2021.pdf
"Under our corporate governance guidelines, directors have direct access to company management to secure the information they need for their dutiesBoard performance Our board’s Nominating and Governance Committee has the delegated purposes of: •Assuring that the composition, practices, and operation of our board contribute to lasting value creation and effective representation of our stockholders; and •Assisting in selecting board and committee members, committee selection and rotation practices, evaluating the board’s overall effectiveness, and reviewing and considering developments in corporate governance practices.",RMD_2021.pdf

"In each of the three fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, we replaced one of our longest- serving independent directors with a newly elected director, and in 2021 we added two additional directors.",RMD_2021.pdf
The committee believes the independent directors now represent an appropriate balance of tenure.,RMD_2021.pdf
The performance of directors who are seeking re-election at the end of their three-year term is ultimately reviewed by stockholders through their votes at the annual stockholder meeting.,RMD_2021.pdf
Our independent directors review the performance of the chief executive officer at least annually.,RMD_2021.pdf
"Board and executive remuneration Our board’s Compensation Committee reviews cash compensation, benefits, perquisites, and equity compensation of directors and executives, including target and actual short-term incentives.",RMD_2021.pdf
The committee’s in-depth review of director and executives’ compensation is published in our proxy statement to stockholders before ResMed’s annual general meetings.,RMD_2021.pdf
The principles governing our executive compensation program include: RESMED IN BRIEF GOVERNANCE OUR PEOPLE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OUR PRODUCTS COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT •Pay-for-performance.,RMD_2021.pdf
"Pay-for-performance, alignment with stockholder interests, and largely at-risk compensation are the cornerstones of our compensation program.",RMD_2021.pdf
"A significant portion of our executives’ compensation is at-risk and tied to the achievement of pre-established short-term corporate financial objectives through our annual cash incentive programs that our corporate officers earn based on achieving our corporate goals for adjusted net sales and adjusted operating profit, weighted equally.",RMD_2021.pdf
These two measures represent fundamental financial metrics: top-line sales and bottom-line profit.,RMD_2021.pdf
Our executives in charge of a business unit have 60% of their incentive opportunity tied to achieving set goals for the same metrics at the business unit level and the remaining 40% tied to the corporate goals.,RMD_2021.pdf
All payouts are determined in accordance with these objective performance metrics.,RMD_2021.pdf
"For fiscal year 2021, named executive officer payouts ranged from 115% to 120% of target cash incentive opportunity, with no discretion applied to the amount paid, reflecting our strong performance.",RMD_2021.pdf

Our objective is to provide a target total compensation program that is competitive with similarly sized U.S.-based public companies in the medical device and medical technology industries with which we compete for executive talent.,RMD_2021.pdf
The committee reviews benchmark data for the individual and the group as a whole but does not target a specific benchmark level.,RMD_2021.pdf
"For our executives, total target compensation should reflect a relatively lower emphasis on salary and a higher percentage of pay at risk in the form of an annual cash incentive.",RMD_2021.pdf
"The committee’ s target cash compensation guidelines are broad, to better recognize individual situations, and also allows us to reflect the fact that we set challenging targets for our incentive programs.",RMD_2021.pdf
•Make informed decisions.,RMD_2021.pdf
"The committee has retained FW Cook, Inc., an independent compensation consultant, to advise the committee with respect to compensation matters for executive officers, and to perform a comprehensive market analysis of our executive compensation program, pay levels, and relative operating performance.",RMD_2021.pdf

"54 ResMed 20/21 Report on ESG RESMED IN BRIEF GOVERNANCE OUR PEOPLE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OUR PRODUCTS COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTThe increase in our global energy consumption in 2021 is due to various factors, offsetting the overall energy efficiency improvement and control enhancement implemented during fiscal year 2021 .",RMD_2021.pdf
Some of the primary driving factors are: •Expansion of business activities.,RMD_2021.pdf
•Expansion and relocation of our Singapore major manufacturing site and other facilities.,RMD_2021.pdf
"•To increase the separation of staff by time and distance to maintain adherence to Public Health Orders, keep our staff safe and meet our market expectations, production activities were rescheduled across three shifts.",RMD_2021.pdf
"This led to significantly more run hours for the HVAC, lighting, and other systems to meet operator comfort and production environment requirements.",RMD_2021.pdf
"•To significantly lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission across production and office areas and help maintain business continuity, ventilation by outside air (OA) was significantly increased, to meet a minimum of 6 air changes per hour .",RMD_2021.pdf
"The higher OA percentage increases the demand for chilling, heating, humidification and dehumidification systems resulting in higher overall plant energy consumption.",RMD_2021.pdf
•Incremental operating utility expenses not running full production capacity during lockdowns: lighting and other utilities.,RMD_2021.pdf
"•Additional exhaust requirements for new equipment supporting the manufacture of new mask product designs have also placed considerable additional load on the air conditioning in this 24/7 area, which includes dehumidification.",RMD_2021.pdf
"These contributing factors, as well as natural variations in seasons across the years, have led to modest increases.",RMD_2021.pdf
"Besides the total electricity and natural gas consumption, we also set gross energy intensity (total consumption/revenue in millions) that measures the relationship of ResMed energy consumption and revenue growth in Table 12.",RMD_2021.pdf
"Despite COVID-19 restriction on production and the spike of COVID-19 restriction related energy consumption, the steady energy intensity in 2021 indicates that our operation is becoming less energy-intensive and more financially rewarding compared to last year's data.",RMD_2021.pdf
"Manufacturing energy Our significant manufacturing operations are located in Sydney ; Singapore; Malaysia; and Chatsworth, California, USA.",RMD_2021.pdf
We use an index of energy intensity that measures the energy used for our production output.,RMD_2021.pdf
The index was set at 100 for fiscal y ear 20 10 and fell by 23.4% to 72.6 during fiscal year 2021: see Table 12.,RMD_2021.pdf
The increase of intensity index corresponds to those driving factors analyzed in Group Energy Use.,RMD_2021.pdf
"Over the year, our energy efficiency has improved through changes to production equipment, manufacturing process, and production lines.",RMD_2021.pdf
This involves adding new lean process equipment such as robot demoulders and conveying systems.,RMD_2021.pdf
"Although new process equipment consumes greater energy, it delivers higher productivity and better energy intensity.",RMD_2021.pdf

"A significant portion of our executives’ compensation is at risk and tied to the achievement of pre-established short-term corporate financial objectives through our annual cash incentive programs that our corporate officers earn based on achieving our goals relating to adjusted net sales and adjusted operating profit, weighted equally.",RMD_2020.pdf
These two measures represent fundamental financial metrics: top-line sales and the portion of those top-line sales that fall to the bottom line.,RMD_2020.pdf
Our executives in charge of a principal unit have 60% of their incentive opportunity tied to achieving set goals for the same metrics at the business unit level and the remaining 40% tied to the corporate goals.,RMD_2020.pdf
All payouts are determined in accordance with these objective performance metrics.,RMD_2020.pdf
"Executive officer payouts ranged from 96% to 121% of target in Fiscal Year 2020 with no discretion applied to the amount paid, with the payouts reflecting our strong performance and our rigorous goals.",RMD_2020.pdf
• Provide market-competitive compensation.,RMD_2020.pdf
Our objective is to provide a target total compensation program that is competitive with similarly sized US-based public companies in the medical device and medical technology industries with which we compete for executive talent.,RMD_2020.pdf
"The committee reviews benchmark data for the individual and for the group as a whole, but does not target a specific benchmark level.",RMD_2020.pdf
"For our executives, total target compensation should reflect a relatively lower emphasis on salary and a higher percentage of pay at risk in the form of an annual cash incentive and equity awards.",RMD_2020.pdf
"The guideline is broad, to recognize individual situations, and also allows us to reflect the fact that we set challenging targets for our incentive programs.",RMD_2020.pdf
• Make informed decisions.,RMD_2020.pdf
"The committee has retained FW Cook, Inc., an independent compensation consultant, to advise the committee with respect to compensation matters for executive officers, and to perform a comprehensive market analysis of our executive compensation program, pay levels, and relative operating performance.",RMD_2020.pdf
FW Cook performs no work for us other than its work providing executive compensation consulting services to the committee.,RMD_2020.pdf

"The second horizon is the treatment of respiratory disease, especially chronic pulmonary disease, or COPD.",RMD_2017.pdf
Our devices are used to treat respiratory disease in the hospital and at home.,RMD_2017.pdf
Our telemedicine technologies in these areas create integrated connected solutions that are a key enablers for treatment.,RMD_2017.pdf
"Some patients with advanced COPD may benefit from the use of ventilation at night, but until rec ently only a small number of COPD patients were treated using ventilation on a long -term basis.",RMD_2017.pdf

"During fiscal year 2017, the committee used a guideline for our chief executive officer’s total target cash compensation (assum ing a cash short -term incentive earned for achieving the goals at plan) at approximately the 50th percentile of our U.S. peer group; and that total target cash compensation should reflect a relatively lower emphasis on salary and a higher percentage of pay at risk in the form of an annual cash incentive.",RMD_2017.pdf
This was consistent with the belief that total direct compensation should at least be at median.,RMD_2017.pdf
"The guideline is broad to recognize individual situations, and also allows us to reflect the fact that we set challenging targets for our short -term incentive programs.",RMD_2017.pdf
.,RMD_2017.pdf
 alignment with stockholder interests .,RMD_2017.pdf
Equity is a key component of our executive compensation.,RMD_2017.pdf
"We believe our equity -based incentive award program enhances long -term stockholder value and encour ages long-term performance, because equity -based incentive awards align our executives’ financial rewards with those of our stockholders, through appreciation of our stock price.",RMD_2017.pdf
"During fiscal year 2017, we continued our performance stock unit equity progr am, in which performance stock units represented 50% of the equity value in our annual grants.",RMD_2017.pdf
"Performance criteria for performance stock units granted during fiscal year 2017 are based on absolute total shareholder return over a four -year measurement peri od, with an opportunity to accelerate payouts after year three, if total shareholder return performance is high enough.",RMD_2017.pdf
"The committee believes this design aligns with actual stockholder experience, reduces point -to-point volatility, rewards performance for which executives are accountable, and provides a strong retention mechanism.",RMD_2017.pdf
"In fiscal year 2017, we also continued our practice of providing executives the choice to select whether the balance of their ResMed 2016/17 Report on ESG issues Page 15 of 42 equity awards would be entirely in the form of stock options, entirely in restricted stock units or evenly split (in value) between the two.",RMD_2017.pdf

"As we successfully reduce risks in the production environment, a higher proportion of our safety and risk management actions are lower -order ‘administrative ’ actions for controlling residual risks, such as communicating risks, and providing protective clothing and equipment.",RMD_2017.pdf
We expect to further reduce incident rates with design factors and continuous improvement in our operational risk management.,RMD_2017.pdf
"To elimina te risks from the line, product development engineers look at product design and the manufacturing processes Health and wellbeing programs at some locations also contribute to lower incident rates.",RMD_2017.pdf

"Gas is consumed chiefly by our heating, ventilating, and air conditioning system’s boilers for space heating and for humidity control in manufacturing areas, as well as for domestic hot water and kitchen use.",RMD_2017.pdf
Its use primarily reflects variable climatic conditions and building design and use.,RMD_2017.pdf
"The primary electricity uses in research, professional and administrative services are HVAC chille rs, vertical transport, research and development lab equipment (environmental chambers, ovens, lathes, mills), lighting, catering and office equipment.",RMD_2017.pdf
These uses respond more to behavioural change.,RMD_2017.pdf
"Manufacturing energy Our significant manufacturing operations are locat ed in Sydney, Singapore, Malaysia and Chatsworth, California.",RMD_2017.pdf
We use an index of energy intensity that measures the energy used for our production output.,RMD_2017.pdf
"The index was set at 100 for 2010, and has now fallen by 26.7% to 73.3 in 2017.",RMD_2017.pdf
See Table 13.,RMD_2017.pdf
Our energy efficiency has been improved through changes to production equipment or manufactu ring process.,RMD_2017.pdf
This involves adding new lean process equipment such as r obot demoulde rs and conveying s ystems.,RMD_2017.pdf
"Altho ugh new process equipment consumes greater energy, it delivers higher productivity, and better energy intensity.",RMD_2017.pdf
